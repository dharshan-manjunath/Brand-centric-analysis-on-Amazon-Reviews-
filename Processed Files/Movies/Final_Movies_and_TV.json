I didn't care for the way they brought him back into the series for a couple episodes - I think they could have done more with his character. Still a great series which ended far too soon.But I would be remiss if I didn't comment on the product side of the DVD set. ADV films seems to have a real quality control problem. If one pays almost $60 for a DVD set, one should expect pretty flawless performance when playing. But I found defective disks. Amazon is greatly to be commended as their customer service did all they could to make it right. Amazon has excellant customer service and I applaud them. But ADV Films, since they went to the silly double-sided DVDs, seems to have quality control problems and ship sets with defective disks. Anyone purchasing the set - I would recommend that you spend the first hour starting each episode to see that it plays so that if you have to return the set, you can do so quickly. I found on disk 1 side A two episodes would play flawlessly while the middle episode would skip/freeze and generally create errors which kept me from actually watching the episode. Its sad that the DVD product of such a great series should suffer so."],["The season was better developed than season 1, but do not meet season 2 and 3 standard. Don't spend time on the next and last season."],["Although this particular run of Andromeda does not feature as much of the struggle as was felt in seasons 1, 2 and 3, it does feature all of the elements which made the series enjoyable.  There is lots of campy dialogue, lots of space battles, and lots of sci fi fun.  However, by this point the series assumes that viewers are knowledgable about the show.  From the beginning, the season begins to tackle long unanswered questions about the series, revealing such secrets as the true origins of Bekka, Trance and Tyr.  For thos who have never seen the show, I recommend that you purchase seasons 1 or 2.  For fans of the series, I highly recommend this addition to your collection.The season starts with the exit of Tyr, and the first four episodes without him are a little shaky.  Fans of Harper will enjoy watching Harper trudge his way through away missions with Romy and Bekka.  This is fun because Harper had previously been left behind on the ship in most episodes before this season.Fans of the series will remember that Rev Bem left the series midway through season 3, so the show lost two of its male characters.  The early episodes of the show then allow Harper to step up and take a more commanding role in the series.  Evidently, this didn't sit so well with producers, who then added Telemachus Rhade to the cast.Telemachus Rhade is a direct descendant of Gaheris Rhade, the dude who betrayed Captain Hunt in Episode 1.  Thanks to Season 3's \"the Unconquerable Man\", we have been led to understand that Gaheris is in fact, an honorable man, and therefore, we can trust his descendant.  IHMO, the addition of this new character helps this series immensly.Played by Steve Bacic, Rhade's tortured sense of need to evolve as a Nietzchien instantly gives us a peek into an impressive but troubled character.Tyr makes a comeback in two of the Rhade episodes as a dreadlock-less slave to the Abyss.  Tyr and Rhade make for some tremendous fight scenes, and we say goodbye to Tyr in a way that kept me waiting for his return.Trance really comes into her own this season, and the revelations made about Bekka's past help to fill out her character.As for the special features, you probably saw all this stuff when it came out on individual dvd sets.  Still, some interviews, behind the scenes, bloopers and deleted scenes will keep most fans happy.  Also, there is an alternative ending to the season, to my understanding something they wrote with the thought that the show may be cancelled at the end of the fourth season (I have no way of confirming this right now, sorry) .My only complaint with this and all the other Andromeda DVD sets is that the sound is never in Dolby 5.1.  It is in Dolby surround sound, but you'd think they'd be able to add that feature without difficulty.However, these are small complaints about a great overall set.4 out of 5 stars."],["Very good plot.  I enjoy good Science Fiction that uses believable technology, and ties it into a strong plot.  The Amdromeda series does this.  The only other Science Fiction Series to do this was Star Trek, and it and Angromeda were a creation of Gene Roddenberry"],["at least two were scratched to the point that on show section couldn't be view, had to skip ahead an miss an integral part of show."],["This DVD set was a birthday gift...my brother-in-law was very happy to receive this and watched it the very next day!! Item arrived quick and was in great condition...so overall a positive experience!! :)"],["This review is for \"Andromeda - Season 4 Collection\". (different from the Complete Season 4) This particular season needs no further review from what has already been posted here. This review is primarily for this particular set. Amazon is very lackluster in the details of this set and what it contains. Unlike previous season collections of Andromeda that contained only a few episodes each, this Season 4 collection is the COMPLETE season. You get all 22 episodes plus a lot of extras to the tune of over 1,100+ minutes grand total of content. There are actually TEN discs in this set and not the \"5\" advertised by Amazon. (two discs per case; of which there are five cases inside the boxset) The MSRP for this collection is more than the Complete Season 4 season also for sale here on Amazon, and for good reason; it contains more! If you like lots of extra goodies, skip the \"complete season 4\" and get this collection instead."],["Some shows start out bland and get better as they mature. Others start out at their peak and get progressively worse as time goes on. Andromeda is one of the latter kinds.Season 4 saw Andromeda degenerate into an incoherent mess. The show's earlier seasons had their fair share of bad episodes, but they were often bad because of poor execution or oversimplification in favor of action. Season 4's episodes often just don't make any sense or don't have any relevance - they are very much mindless action hour fare.When I first saw season 4, I had not yet seen season 3, so I assumed there would be things that I would have missed and that wouldn't make quite as much sense to me as they would have if I had seen the 3rd season first. But now that I've seen season 3, I have to say that season 4 *still* doesn't make any sense. Too many things were invented on the fly and then placed into the story as if they had always been there without any further explanation. Ironically, these self-contained action hours rely on the ability of the audience to pick up in the middle of an existing story every bit as much as arc-based storytelling would have. The only difference is that arc-based storytelling is interesting to long-term viewers and spontaneously invented backstory isn't.One of the most severe blows to the show came in the loss of Keith Hamilton Cobb. Actually, it would be more accurate to say that the loss of Tyr Anasazi was a big reason for the loss of quality. Season 1 had an excellent combination with Dylan Hunt as the idealist who was occasionally willing to compromise his ideals to get the job done, Rev Bem as the center of highest ideals, and Tyr Anasazi as a primarily self-interested, realistic balance. The show was able to stay afloat despite the departure of the Rev Bem character, because it still had Dylan's idealism against Tyr's realism. Season 4 changes all that. With Tyr gone, completely gone is much of what gave the series its initial potential.Even in some of the first 3 seasons' worst episodes, you would have great lines like, \"[when the universe ends] there will be 3 survivors: Tyr Anasazi, the cockroaches, and Dylan Hunt, trying to save the cockroaches.\" But season 4 has lost that in favor of Telemachus Rhade, who simply doesn't have the same Nietzschean flair that Tyr had. In fact, Telemachus is rarely ever interesting. His banter with Harper borders on laughably pathetic, with such lines as \"Insulting a Nietzschean is not healthy for a human's health.\"But even without that foil, all would not have been lost except for the pseudo-continuity and constant introduction of characters that we've never heard of as if we should know who they are. The first episode of the season introduces a number of new characters but acts as if they've been there all along, and it was frankly just weird. When I first saw it, I assumed that characters such as Tri-Jema and others had been introduced in season 3, but in fact they weren't and they all made their first appearances in season 4.Tarazed, a planet last mentioned in season 2's \"Home Fires\" - and a planet that chose *NOT* to join the re-established Commonwealth in that episode - is all of a sudden the seat of Commonwealth government.Tri-Camille \"displaces\" her \"sister\" Tri-Ortiz, presumably a reference to the Isabella Ortiz in season 2, but there are problems with this that should be obvious to anyone who's actually watched that season 2 episode.We also now have melting Abyss people, and the first time this happens no one acts as if it's out of the ordinary despite the fact that it had never happened before in any season of the show. Then there's the dozens of people that Dylan \"knows\" but we've never seen before. Exactly when did he meet them? Don't forget, this guy doesn't have 40-odd years of time behind him, since he was frozen in time for 300 years.There's the sudden introduction of a bad guy group called \"Collectors\" who have never before been a remotely bad presence, and we've now got \"radical isotopes\" and 3-d cubes as instant bad guy detectors.The season's biggest failure is that, despite some major events  like the Commonwealth descending into civil war, none of this is really leading anywhere. Sure, the new Commonwealth is practically in chaos (or is it? this season makes it hard to tell), but I'd be hard-pressed to tell you why that matters. Along the same lines: Rev Bem makes an appearance this season, and at the end of his episode, he says he wants to stay on the Andromeda, but he never appears again for the rest of the season.I suppose I could be asking too much. How much story can you really expect from a show whose title says, \"The universe is a dangerous place. We fight to make it safe\"?With those criticisms voiced, I will say that there are still some good moments in this season. The last few episodes of the season are pretty good, even if the last two kind of start acting like the whole \"restoring the Commonwealth\" thing was not what Dylan was *really* supposed to be doing all this time (what?!). One of them even has a pretty good scene that makes fun of technobabble and the absurdly precise time estimates until disaster that are common in Star Trek.And one thing that all Andromeda episodes have going for them is that even the worst episodes tend to be far more entertaining than your average Star Trek fare.Still, this one is hard to recommend as a purchase, even for fans of the series (though I guess it depends on why you like the show).On the DVD side of things, the discs are double-sided, which cuts down on the amount of packaging but makes the discs far more prone to damage. There are annoying ads at the beginning of the discs that will be completely irrelevant in a few years, but they are fortunately easily skipped with the chapter skip. Although I haven't watched very many of them, there also seems to be a lot of special feature content like interviews and stuff."],["Keith Hamilton Cobb did leave the show to go back to Young and The Restless, but he was doing both shows at once. He didn't like how the show was going so he asked to be outed of the show. But I have been a fan of Kevin Sorbo since his Hercules days, and I already have all 5 seasons on VHS, til I can get them on DVD. Gene Roddenberry is a genius and should be praised for his work. May he Rest in Peace"],["I enjoyed this series when it was on television, and had to add it to my library when it became available on DVD. The acting is very good, the stories are interesting. Well worth the price...Kevin Sorbo can play a captain as well as a mythical hero. The humor is very good as well as the action."],["I love Andromeda and it was great to see all the new DVDs. I hope they have soon the 5 Season finished and as a Box set."],["An enjoyable sci-fi show from Gene Roddenberry. More gritty and realistically human in some ways than the Star Trek franchise."],["If you are watching this series in a DVD, continuosly, like a soap opera, in my opinion, it's simply not the same as the other seasons. You expect a connection among the episodes, but there are many flaws, both in the story and in the behavior of some caracters . Anyway, at this point, I thought the explanations would come later. On the other hand,  I was already fond of the series and watching it is always good. There are also some great episodes.  I recommend."],["Season 4 of Andromeda started to be weel known because it is when Keith Hamilton Cobb left the show to do some kind of Soap Opera job but anyway, this season had a new guy and I think that this season for Andromeda really marked, the beginning of the end of the series although really forced from the last 3 seasons, this season would be the one before the end. So I would have to give this box a total of 4/5 stars. Great show, just dumbed down."],["Probably the best season, in my opinion. Won't go into any spoilers, but this one is far better than 5 where they got rid of Rommy and failed to wrap up major plot lines"],["Andromeda Season four is one of my favorite seasons, second favorite for sure. The surprise, intrigue, and mystery of what's goign to happen, and danger that's been building all previous seasons from the Magog, the Abyss, and now, the Collectors, makes for some epic 'surrounded on all sides, with no way out, but we're going to win anyway' kind of action that these writers did all too well. It's a must for all true Sci-Fi fans, let alone Roddenberry Fans. It's not Star Trek, Its so much better, and that's coming from a very big trek fan! Even if you're not into sci-fi, this is the show to watch."],["i had forgotten just how good this series was."],["I am disappointed on the loss of Tyr I thought he was an outstanding character played by a great actor.  Rhade is is a character I think should have been in as a regular a couple seasons back as he seemed to fit in with the crew and the storylines.  His introduction to this season was a bit shaky concerning the story but what the hay he's on board.  Cobb trading Sci-Fi for a Soap Opera doesn't seem a good trade as I am sure the soap operas would have waited.  I would have liked to have seen the Tyr character interact with Rhade through a couple seasons.  With thier differing outlooks/ philosophies it would have made for great stories.  I feel that they should just drop the Rev Ben character once and for all for as he evolves he bocomes less interesting and bringing him in for a story or two here and there totally changing the once strong idealist into the weak thing that I saw was just annoying.-The last episode in this series was very confusing to me but I am sure it will be explained in the next season."],["Season Four has a great ending, but that is one of the few great things about it.  There were some subtle improvements, such as the CGI, which got better in each season of the series.  While the CGI was crude and unimpressive in the first couple of seasons, by Season four it rivaled that of far better shows like FARSCAPE, FIREFLY, and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.  But the narrative remained flat and generally uninteresting.Yes, the narrative.  Ultimately how a show tells a story is what makes or dooms it.  In an article in ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY during the first season of LOST.  Show runner Damon Lindelhof was talking about what makes good TV narrative and what does not.  He argued, and I think correctly, that shows that focus on plot rather than character development ultimately will be lessened for it.  His goal was to keep LOST focused on character development like BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER rather than those that focus on plot.  He didn't mention ANDROMEDA, but it is a classic example of a series that is seriously hampered by an almost complete lack of concern with character development.  Most of the characters on ANDROMEDA never change, never alter, never develop or mature.  Dylan Hunt is still precisely the same character he was in Season One.  The same is true of Beka, Harper, and Romy.  That this is true is especially tragic with Romy, since the possible growth as a person of someone who is an android would have made for a fascinating story.  As it were, the only character who evolves at all is Trance.After three seasons of clothing Trance in mystery, we finally discover what her major secrets were in Season Four.  And it was hardly disappointing.  One can wonder why she was the only character on the show allowed to grow at all in the first four seasons.What should have been a great improvement in the show was the departure of Tyr.  Unfortunately, Steve Bacic's Rhade, a direct descendent of the Rhade who tried to kill Dylan in the series pilot (and who made several appearances on the show in the first three seasons), ended up a profoundly uninteresting character, far less interesting than he had been when he was only guest starring.Most of the show continued to perpetuate the problems that crippled the show in the first three seasons:  an unrelenting reliance on the worst stereotypes of TV Sci-fi, superficial storylines, facile dire circumstances each week and their equally facile solutions, and a long string of one-dimensional characters.  Plus, the show simply revels in the unreality of things.  For instance, people fly al the spaceships.  The idea that people would pilot spaceships is an absurd one.  Even today U. S. military pilots do not do the majority of the piloting of their aircraft.One interesting scene in Season Four takes place in the abandoned potash silo that has been repeatedly in Vancouver-based Sci-fi series.  It was used in THE X-FILES in their Vancouver years.  It was used in the short-lived BIONIC WOMAN remake.  BATTLESTAR GALACTICA used it twice.  The first time it was used as Ragnar Station in the miniseries.  Then in Season Three it was used for the Temple of Five.  The only time that the exterior has been used that I know of was in the series DARK ANGEL, when Max and Zack attacked it to rescue their \"sister\" from Manticore.  There are shots inside, but shots outside as well.  I don't remember it having been in SMALLVILLE, but I'm sure it has been.  I'd also be willing to bet that it was used in one of more of the STARGATEs.  The structure is notable for its enormous height and the huge rod that runs from the middle of the area to the top.  I'm certain that when they built the silo that they had no idea that it would become one of Vancouver's most heavily used locations.Fans of BSG will enjoy guest appearances by two actresses who were probably filming their roles in the same year that they were filming the miniseries for BSG.  The two are Grace Park aka Sharon Valerii/Agathon and Kandyse McClure aka Dualla.  There is also an appearance by Aaron Douglas aka Chief Galen Tyrol (in the same episode that Erica Durance, later Lois Lane of SMALLVILLE, and Missy Peregrym from REAPER - unfortunately, the episode is an absolutely awful one).All in all, the series continues to disappoint.  I suppose that the one group of people who would enjoy this are those who just enjoy superficial action series with traditional heroes and villains.  But if you want good story telling and less than superficial characters, you need to look elsewhere."],["Like season 3, season 4 also had a few bad episodes that were very confusing.  There was an overuse of clips of previous episodes as a storytelling device, and some shows, like the first episode, had deus-ex-machina endings that came out of nowhere.  The season gets better as it goes, with many of the finest episodes (\"Trusting the Gordian Maze\", \"Time out of Mind\") on the last disk.  The final episode is very touching, and would have been a fine ending to the series if there was no season 5.In the first two years Tyr served as the realist/anarchist foil to Dylan's idealism/community building.  In season 4 Dylan was more the Hercules-style adventurer and moralist.  To serve as a partner, Telemachus Rhade was added as a regular.  While a Nietzschean, he was multi-faceted and interesting, and had an earnestness that complimented Dylan and the rest of the Andromeda crew.  The Andromeda gained a new bad guy in the form of an internal power struggle in the Commonwealth by a group called the Collectors.  Some of the Collector episodes are good, some are poor re-hashes of ideas from old Stargate SG-1 episodes.Speaking of Stargate, like every show filmed in Canada you can bet on a number of familiar guest stars.  Some recurring characters from Stargate and a few regulars from Battlestar Galactica are prominent.You again get double sided disks in 5 regular sized cases.  The user interface is clear and easy to use, but again the episodes are just listed by their number instead of title.  The cases do not have any episode synopses, and the titles are all famously grand and cryptic so it is hard to remember what happens in each.  Front loaded ads and warnings are all skippable.If you liked the previous seasons of Andromeda, go ahead and get this one too."],["I have just finished watching the 4th. season and I must admit I was impressed.  So far this has been the best season yet.  Since I am a sci-fi fan first thing I will comment on is special effects.  As you know the previous seasons effects were good, but not as they should have been, the detail was lacking and a lot of shots were recycled.  This season the effects definitely improved, a lot more definition to details, better realism, amazing space battles.  The story has also improved considerably, they were interesting, had good continuation, made you think and be entertained at the same time.  Overall every part of the show stepped up quite a few notches.  So if you got through the first 3 seasons and have decided not to watch the rest, you are making a mistake.  If you are a true sci-fi fan you will not be dissapointed."],["I am so glad that they came back out with these and at a price we can afford.  It is the only show of his I have not seen yet.

If anything, I was more concerned with &#34;Are they going to get through this together?&#34; than with &#34;Is Crichton going to unlock wormhole knowledge?&#34; without realizing that the two questions were interconnected.In any case, those are the philosophical questions that ran through my mind through this entire series, and although the ending to this season isn't the neat and tidy conclusion I was expecting when I first watched some 8 years ago, it's beautiful in its simplicity and universality.

After the events in season 3, it was an internal struggle to accept the direction the show took this season. *SPOILERS*  The who's the baby's daddy storyline was completely ridiculous to accept, especially after the powerful relationship John and Aeryn had in season 3. I know they explained how it was possible, but it just didn't work for me. Why did the writers do this? Am I watching Jerry Springer? Also, they made Aeryn cold and distant, worse than season 1, for more than half of this season.  Aeryn was one of my favorites, but the writers really dragged her character through the mud this season. The relationship between John and Aeryn takes two steps back to the point where they are trying to figure out if they should be together (season 2 anyone?). At one point Aeryn says &#8220;I did everything I could to keep us together&#8221; Huh...did you forget that you left last season(wtf writers).  Bringing Scorpius on board just didn't work for me either.  Him and Sikozu had terrible chemistry with the rest of the crew. Their crew group scenes were hard to watch because they just didn't fit in, it felt forced almost.  And finally, are we really going to rehash the peacekeepers chasing Crichton for wormhole technology storyline again; should have been done after season 3, okay. The cliffhanger to this season was a motherload!The Good: The season started off okay until episode 5. I thought Noranti's quirkiness meshed well with the rest of the group. I liked her over Stark, Jool, and especially Sikozu.  D'argo, Rygel, and Chiana were more comfortable in their roles and played their characters very well. Season 3 and season 4 you can tell they act more natural giving to the illusion of realism.  Rygel had some great one liners throughout the season and started to be more of a team player which I enjoyed.  The &#34;kansas&#34; episode was the best one this season, in my opinion, it was because Aeryn was acting normal (not the bitch in previous episodes this season) and the whole crew was back together working as a team without Scorpius and Sikozu. The chemistry of the original characters plus Noranti works well together and I think that's why this episode is particularly good.Overall, I really felt the writers dropped the ball this season. The crew had a chance to be free and travel to each others home worlds (even Chiana mentions it) and resolve those story lines.  They did not, but decided to rehash the peacekeepers chasing Crichton storyline again.  The wormhole storyline was overcooked at this point.

WOO HOO, I love me some Farscape!"],["There are few shows out there as inventive and wild as &#34;Farscape&#34; and it continues to carve out its unique niche with this fourth season. Ben Browder continues his commanding performance as the human John Crichton, lost in the depths of space among aliens. His growth over the course of the show has been stellar, and that development doesn't slow down here. Aeryn, played by Claudia Black, also has some really meaty stuff to work with and is given some interesting directions. The rest of the returning characters are pretty much as they've always been (with some minor tweaking or highlights here or there,) but John and Aeryn have always been the heart of the show and where the most change/growth is.The new character of Sikozu is an interesting addition to the crew, and she brings back that sense of &#34;can she really be counted on?&#34; that many of the characters had early on but lost over time as they all bonded. Grayza being promoted to the big villain on the Peacekeeper side is functional, but she's unremarkable as a villain. Thankfully Scorpius is still around to keep things lively, and his shifting role in all of this always adds a nice edge to things.On an episode by episode basis the quality varies quite a bit. When the episodes factor in some way into the larger story of the season then they tend to work quite well. The more stand alone episodes feel like the filler that they are. The problem with these episodes is that they've become very formulaic, with the crew making a deal with the wrong person (or something along those lines) and then having to work their way out of the issues that ensue. By contrast the episodes that feed into the larger overall story are much less predictable and yield some truly stellar moments."],["The fourth, and ultimately final, season of Farscape saw astronaut John Crichton (Ben Browder) and Aeryn (Claudia Black) end up together as the seeds of what will be an uneasy alliance between Crichton and Scorpius (Wayne Pygram) are planted when Scorpius saves Aeryn's life.  War begins to brew as the reptillian-esque Scarrans now seek the wormhole technology Crichton knows to rule the universe, no matter the cost.  The series finale, appropriately entitled \"Bad Timing\", ends on a heck of a cliffhanger and both Crichton and Aeryn are blasted to bits, leading way to the recent, and outstanding, mini-series Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars.  While the fourth season of Farscape wasn't the best the series had to offer, it was still exceptional sci-fi TV that continued to soar in new and innovative directions.  In the end however, despite suffering the untimely fate of cancellation, Farscape did what shows like Babylon 5 and the various Star Trek series' couldn't do: continue to be original, intelligent, and just plain amazing, even while facing the inevitable threat of cancellation.  And by the time the Peacekeeper Wars are over, one can't pray for a better way to send off this supremely original and fantastic series."],["Excellent Show! If this show was still on the air today, I'd still be watching. Four seasons was not enough."],["While Season 4 definitely had it's exciting, fun Farscape moments, and still added to this fantastic series as a whole, as compared to the other seasons, it only rated 3-stars for me.I know I will be branded the scourge of the Earth for the this review.  But I've watched every Farscape episode and I've got to tell you that Season 4 was a huge disappointment for me.  In that, the majority of the focus was on John and Aeryn to the near exclusion of the remaining characters.  Everyone but John and Aeryn simply stopped evolving to an appreciable degree.Instead of the storylines being tributaries meandering through the lives of all the characters, there was only one steady flow raging through the lives of John and Aeryn.  Quite frankly, it got very old, very quickly for me.  Season 4 consisted of: Tune in next week to see John pining for Aeryn or Aeryn pining for John.  Tune in next week to see John looking for wormholes or Earth.  After 21 episodes, I was over hearing about the lovesick John/Aeryn, and even sicker of those frelling wormholes.We never got to know more about D'Argo or visit the Luxan home world.  We never got know more about Rygel or visit the Hynerian home world.  And that goes for all of the other characters too.  The series ended with the Peacekeeper Wars, yet we barely got to see the animus that brewed between the factions.  Apparently there was a whole universe of interesting storylines out there but we rarely got to see any of them.  Why?Because for some reason, the PTB thought we needed to see show after show of \"John loves Aeryn (and vice versa)\" and \"John/Scorpious love wormholes\".  Reminiscent of wasting three entire episodes (during the first season) on the absurd \"Princess loves John, demands to marry him, and suddenly the battle-hardened Farscape crew who have escaped from everywhere else are not even bothering with an exit strategy.\"  Yes, I can see how these stories would be more interesting than powerful, warring factions plotting to destroy each other, along with any other species who get in their way.Sorry folks, I cannot drink the Farscape kool-aid for Season 4. It was a huge let down for me considering it was the last season of the series. It was stagnate and missed an opportunity for the fans really enjoy ALL of the characters, including Pilot, in more than just supportive by-product roles.I put on hiatus viewing my other sci-fi shows so I could devote my time to viewing all of the Farscape episodes.  It was a refreshing relief to get back to watching Stargate Atlantis, in which the action storylines drive the show instead of the passions of one or two specific characters.  Although, Rodney is quickly becoming the Crichton \"all about me\" focus of Atlantis...which is slightly bothersome.

BUT, in season 4 you get the brilliance of an amazing, complex show, truly hitting it's stride. They nailed this, it's one of my favorite single seasons of all time.The acting and directing is phenomenal.  You can sense that cast and crew have learned how to trust each other, and that they are not afraid to take risks.  Both acting and directing is confident, intense, and also not afraid to be playful.  They made me cry, they made me laugh, they made my jaw drop open. Multiple times.The special effects and costumes and set design remain some of the most impressive ever on TV, and superior to many movies. That they were able to make this much magic 22 hours a year (7 years ago) blows my mind.  And season 4, of course is the best ever for visuals and effects.  They all have the basic visual language down cold by now, so they are able to polish and enrich existing props (notice how much more detailed the Droids are this season, or Rigel's puppet) The show has a much richer, more organic look this season. And while computer graphics have come a long way since 2003, Farscape still has some of the most visually arresting CGI ever made for the small screen.Just don't expect a clean ending.  It ends on a cliff-hanger, the whole team was expecting at least one more season.  You want to watch Peacekeeper Wars after.This season has some very disturbing images (Scorpius boot-licking, John's sexual enslavement, Aeryn's double with 1/2 her head blown off in loving close-up, various torture scenes)I definitely would not recommend it for pre or early teen viewing, and if I had a mature teen I'd want to at least talk about it before and after.And it's got a few scenes that I thought didn't work. (including big chunks of \"John Quixote\")The DVD is a bit disappointing.  While it has a number of special features, including deleted scenes and actor interviews, it is completely lacking any commentary tracks.  This show cries out for multiple commentaries from writers, producers, directors and crew, special effects, etc.  I was very let down that they did not do a commentary for at least a few episodes.Despite that.  This is one of the most visually captivating, emotionally moving, and intellectually stimulating single seasons ever to be broadcast.  While I strongly recommend you watch Farscape from beginning to end, if you were only to watch a single season, make it season 4.  If you give it a chance, it will rock your world."],["The third season of Farscapeended with the tried and true method of separating the main characters at a time of crisis so that the opening of the next season could involve their slow and painful attempts to reunite - with the added revelation that one of them is pregnant. A battle had been won but the cost was great for the crew of Moya: though successful in destroying a Peacekeeper research facility that was coming dangerously close to unlocking the secrets to wormhole technology, they lost two of their allies and were divided amongst themselves as they fled from a galaxy that placed even larger bounties on their heads.To backtrack a little, it's worth giving a short summary of the show in general. A quirky and off-beat sci-fi series, \"Farscape\" centers on the adventures of American astronaut John Crichton (Ben Browser), flung through a wormhole to the far side of the galaxy and thrown in with a group of escaped prisoners on board their sentient ship. Since then he's been hunted by the militaristic Peacekeepers and the war-like Scarrans, both of whom are after the wormhole technology that's been implanted in his head. All John wants to do is work things out with his beloved Aeryn (an ex-Peacekeeper) and make it back to his family waiting on Earth.Of course, there's no point in starting your \"Farscape\" adventure this late in the game. In fact, it's very difficult to jump on board after the mid-way point ofseason two, and naturally it's best to begin right back at the start ofseason one. If you make the investment of time and money, then you're in for a well plotted, well characterized and immensely creative and colorful show, which takes the best of the sci-fi genre and twists it on its head. Our heroes are not Starfleet soldiers, but a motley bunch of escaped prisoners, and their aims are not lofty ideals of truth or justice, but the desire to live out their lives in relative peace.That goal is becoming increasingly distant with the growing conflict in the galaxy, and the fact that its resolution lies locked in John's brain. Having been entrusted with the key to wormhole technology by the Ancients, John knows that he alone has the power to prevent war and ensure peace - if only he can figure out *how*.The start of the season finds him scrounging out an existence on board a dying leviathan, joined quickly by a gold-skinned, red-haired, increasingly impatient alien named Sikuzo (Raelee Hill). Arrogant and brash, but with a keen mind and the ability to move her gravitational centre (giving her the ability to walk up walls and ceilings), she becomes a new regular cast member.One by one, the crew of Moya reunites: warrior D'Argo (Anthony Simcoe), thieving Chiana (Gigi Edgley) and ex-emperor Rygel (voiced by Jonathan Hardy). Last of all is Aeryn (Claudia Black), waiting aboard Moya with a surprise guest in tow: Scorpias. The half-Scarran, half-Peacekeeper (Wayne Pygram) is now on the run from the law along with the rest of them, and after spending the last three seasons trying to escape, avoid or outwit his insatiable desire for wormhole technology, Crichton now finds him necessary for his foster-family's survival. The real game-changer comes when Crichton finally makes his way back to Earth and the long-awaited reunion with his father, sister and the friends he left behind. But his presence there only poses a danger to his race, and after a time-traveling escapade back to the 1980s, an awkward reintegration with the world he left behind, an episode-long television expose on Earth's first contact with aliens, and the realization that he's been tracked by his enemies, Crichton makes the decision to return to space and work toward securing the safety of his home planet.From there the episodes are continuously linked all the way up to the grand finale as Moya's crew enters the peace negotiations (better described as intrigues) between the Scarran Emperor and the Peacekeeper Commandant Grayzer. The fact that the three part episode finale is called \"We're So Screwed\" should tell you how well that goes, but the writing team excels with another tightly-written, nail-biting conclusion that ends on an equally jaw-dropping cliffhanger.Season four is not my favorite \"Farscape\" season (that title still belongs tothe third season), but by this stage the writers know their characters inside and out, as well as where exactly the plotlines are going. It was therefore an outrage when the show was abruptly cancelled despite the network's promise that there would be a fifth season for the writers to wrap up their planned storylines - but never fear, there was a reprieve in the show's imminent close in the form of a four-part miniseries that brought \"Farscape\" to a swift, though satisfactory finish.With this in mind, the forth season of \"Farscape\" definitely feels as though it's building toward something. There are far fewer filler episodes this time around (although there is invariably always room for the two that turn up every season: the one where Moya is attacked by some sort of parasite or virus, and the one where the crew wanders onto an alien planet and causes trouble amongst its culture). There is also some incredibly dark content this time around, including torture, slaughter, mind control, humiliation fantasies, and even the rape of two main characters - not graphically, but certainly explicitly. Don't be fooled by the bright colors of the packaging; this show isn't for the kids.Among the supporting cast there is a late return from Stark (Paul Goddard) in the series finale, and we are also joined by a mysterious and rather batty three-eyed seer known as Noranti (Melissa Jaffer), who seems to know more about the circumstances than she's letting on. In her place the character of Jool (Tammy MacIntosh) is dropped, which is something of a mixed blessing. On the one hand, Jool was never a popular character with audiences, on the other, she had been steadily improving over the course of the third season and by her last regular episode she had formed very sweet bonds with the core cast. It was a shame that the writers didn't trust their own development of Jool, as by the time she's shed her obnoxious exterior to become a useful team-member, they get rid of her.Another nitpick is that the show is constantly let down by the weak acting of its extras. It's not so bad when they're hidden under layers of prosthetics, but some of the humanoid characters are painfully stiff and awkward sounding. And the only thing more grating than an Australian accent in uncharted space is an Australian accent disguised as an American accent in uncharted space (not that there's anything wrong with Aussie accents in general!) It wouldn't be so bad if it were not for the inconsistency of the accents used across the show, and as Joss Whedon said in a commentary forFirefly, a show relies on the good acting of its extras and bit-parts to create a sense of reality in their created world. When Crichton was reunited with his family and fellow humans at the season's midway point, it was the terribly stilted acting that pulled me right out of the emotional power of the scene.Season four essentially revolves around two main plotlines: the relationship between John and Aeryn, and John and Scorpias's never-ceasing search for mastery over wormhole technology (with a rather intriguing alliance between Scorpias and Sikozu on the side). One of the side-effects of this is that many of the other characters are shunted to the side, and there is precious little development given to Chiana, D'Argo or Rygel and no real exploration into their cultures and home planets. In lieu of the promised fifth season, the spotlight never returns to them - one suspects that the proposed fifth season would have extended the Scarran/Peacekeeper conflict into a galaxy-wide war that involved all the alien species so far introduced to the show, a development that is sadly never to be realized.Disregarding the Sci-Fi network's lack of foresight in canceling the show before its time, the forth season of \"Farscape\" pushes story and (most) character ahead into the future, once more raising the stakes and increasing the odds against our intrepid heroes.

When it first appeared on TV, I dismissed it without really ever watching it. I am so glad I gave it another chance. I have enjoyed it immensely.Most reviewers have covered this series really well. Two things I would like to add.Scorpius. One of the best villains ever. A well rounded villain that's not really such a bad guy. His costume and makeup are awesome.Cinematography. This series is an absolute joy to watch. Every aspect, from makeup to background shots, are colorful and rich. The aliens looks great, the costumes are impressive and the attention to detail is phenomenal. Farscape alien makeup is the best I have ever seen. Creating this series had to cost bigtime $$$$.This is a series from Jim/Brian Henson so expect a very high quality production. Watching The PeaceKeeper Wars at the end is well worth the $10."],["This is a great show, I wish it would have lasted a lot longer than just the season's it did last..."],["Now that word has arrived that we have the concluding mini-series (and thanks to all of my fellow 'scape fans for writing to Sci-Fi channel without which this would never have happened), I decided to take the plunge and buy season 4 to refresh my memory of what happened to Crichton and his merry band of pransters. Man what a great season. For those that need to know, this boxed is only different in one way from the individual two disc sets with season 4 episodes. It's cheaper. No other extra features besides a nice little box to put them inside. A pity I was hoping for something extra but, hey, with gas prices I'm happy I could save a few bucks. There are a number of strong episodes this season (and only one or two that I thought was absolutely lame)In \"Crichton Kicks\" we are introduced to a new recurring character Sikozu as she crashes into the ship Crichton has taken refuge on in order to escape pirates interested in harvesting Leviathans. He's just about gotten his mathematical formula ready to go when she destroys part of it and they have to team up to stay alive. \"What Was Lost\" is an outstanding two part episode where Crichton hooks up with his buddies and sees Scorpious humiliated by a peacekeeper named Grayza who has delusions of grandeur. Finally Crichton finds Aeryn on Moya with her new friend Scorpious. It seems Scorpi saved her life and, as such, Crichton has a new shipmate.The trilogy of\"Unrealized Reality\", \"Kansas\" and \"Terra Firma\" finds Crichton and the rest of Moya's crew traveling to Earth but at the wrong time. Eventually, they find the right time but, unfortunately, their timing leaves something to be desired. The concluding three part episode \"We're so Screwed\" takes the series in an entirely new direction with Crichton mastering much of the wormhole information that's been locked in his head. It seems the Scarrans have taken Aeryn hostage in hopes of using her as bait to get him to give up the wormhole technology so the Scarrans can rule the known universe. Finally, we get the coda for season four (and the set up for the mini-series). \"Bad Timing\" ties directly into the preceding three episodes concluding the story arc with Crichton learning that the Scarrans may try to invade Earth. Crichton's only choice is to try and close the portal to Earth but will he ever be able to get back?Picture quality is outstanding on each disc with a sharp, crisp high definition transfer. The 5.1 soundmix takes full advantage of the format and the sound has tremendous presence. The extras are numerous with the second and third season bloopers, interviews with cast, deleted scenes, set, prop and costume galleries, early make-up tests (which is really quite fascinating). Each indvidual box comes with a booklet with character histories, season four overviews, episodes synopsis and interesting photos. Special featurettes include \"Cool Farscape Facts\",  \"On the Last Day\" where we get behind the scenes footage for the season four wrap session,\"The Story So Far\" which gives a brief update on the series to season four, \"Villains\", the usual \"Alien Encounters\" bits and \"Farscape Trailers\".All in all another exceptional season. I do miss the commentary tracks. While they didn't have to be on every single episode, I would have enjoyed them on \"Bad Timing\" and the \"We're So Screwed\" trilogy. I suppose you can't have everything but I am quite happy that \"Farscape\" is returning even if only in a limited capacity. A pity that Sci-Fi blundered and cancelled it making us wait this long for the resolution but, hey, at least we have it."],["My wife and I found the series on Amazon and went through the four seasons in several weeks.  Amazing it is not more popular and the show continuing.

The movie deals with real life issues with relationships, life, and love.  I am 27 and I am approaching that 30 year old mark and I can definitely identify with the movie 110%.  I can watch this movie over and over and not get bored.  I would recommend this movie because it is a great entertaining and romantic comedy!!!  Two thumbs up!"],["... &amp; 30 and I will meet face to face!  I loved films where the characters relate to you &amp; friends. I am Natalie 100%.  I have traveled down her path &amp; felt her pain!  I also know a &quot;Joy&quot; (she just got married after being with her boyfriend for about 15 years, granted some of those years were junior high &amp; high school!), a Malik (damn him!) &amp; a Stephanie (working from the outside in vs. the inside out).  I cannot wait to purchase the accompanying book - 100 things you should know before turning 30. Check out the 30yearstolife.com site for teh exact title.  I will &quot;pull a Natalie&quot; when I turn 30, but I know that I am in great company!"],["I agree with Nightscope, this movie can be a model for what average African American movies lovers like to see. Funny yet poignant view of tangible life changes for a young adult.  A good buy!"],["I'll echo the sentiments of many others when I say, this movie was a very pleasant surprise.  It is an intelligent movie that is clearly made by a young black professional, about young black professionals, and featuring young black professionals.  Now to be honest, I saw this movie when it aired on TV One.  I immediately came to Amazon to get a sense of whether it was worth watching.  I was a tiny bit skeptical when I saw the movie cover (looks a little low budget, eh?) and very, very skeptical when I saw Tracy Morgan in the cast list (because his bumbling minstrel schtick on 30 Rock and in his own show IRKS me to no end!), but -- this movie was fantastic!  So realistic.  So well done.  So poignant.  So relatable.  The characters were well-developed and nuanced, and the story was actually well-told (take notes, Tyler Perry, take notes!  To be a full-length movie, the acting by these well-known sitcom actors (e.g. the mom from Fresh Prince, \"Cousin Pam\"/\"Maxine\" from the Cosby Show/Living Single, etc. -- and even Tracy Morgan) is spot-on!THIS is the kind of movie that I want to see more of in the theaters. Let's have less of the cross-dressing men, the gang-banging \"keeping it real\" nonsense, and the rehash of the same old \"urban\" romantic comedy featuring four familiar faces -- and more like \"30 Years to Life.\" In the meantime though, this is a perfect movie for a date night (because it has both the guys' and girls' perspectives), a perfect movie for a girls night in (because it will give you tons of intelligent, knowing laughs and lots to think about as well), and a good movie for those days when it's nothing but you, the remote, and a pint of icecream."],["The best thing about this movie was Tracy Morgan, everyone else in here can not act past a sitcom.Ok, so what you turned 30, so did I but I did not go through this nosense and nobody else I knew did either. This movie was the only depressing thing about turning 30.Later!!!!"],["This movie was good.  I wish that it had a larger audience.  Tracey Morgan was superb and very funny.  Please support it on DVD, since it could not be supported in the movies."],["This movie is great! I saw it in NY and was laughing from start to finish. It is a MUST have for anyone who is about to turn 30.  I have 3 friends turning 30 this year, and several more right on the outskirts of turning 30, I plan to buy this movie for all of them! This movie is so true to what getting older and leaving your 20's is all about!Watch for the toe scene, the ring scene, and the \"what's that noise\" scene -  They all will have you dying laughing."],["When feeling sad, due to passing away of my oldest Brother.

I could relate."],["I actually got this movie when it came out and I paid like $20 something for it. When I watched it I was very disappointed. I really got it to see all the good actors in it. It goes to show just because there is good actors in a movie doesn't mean it will be a good script or movie because of that fact. I thought it would be more in-depth with the characters but it wasn't. You have Tracy Morgan as a struggling comedian who is a promiscuous person who brings no real depth to the story, although he was funny. Then you have the sexy Allen Payne who plays a pretty boy who sleeps with a lot of women but no depth. See where I'm going here? Out of the whole movie I only believed Erika Alexander's character. It just looks like a movie that was put together without much thought to a real plot. I didn't get it, not one of the best movies, needless to say I took the movie back and got a credit for the amount I paid for it. I gave it 2 stars because sexy Allen Payne was in it."],["I LOVED THIS MOVIE! I just caught it on SHOWTIME but missed the first 5 minutes and feel it is a must have. I really appreciated the humor in the relationships as well as the serious sides. I found it very interesting that they were able to capture the sweet and bitter points of relationships and growing older while making this a positive thought provoking movie which moves along nicely. A movie definitely worth viewing."],["I don't know what to say.  My cousin told me that she had this movie she'd never heard of and after watching it, I now see why!  This is a film about friends embarking on their 30th birthdays, their lives and what they haven't accomplished.  Marriage, Weight loss, Career goals.... shoot I'm 31 and trust me it's always going to be a point in your life that you're questioning yourself about something!  I wouldn't spend my money on it, and yes it's African American and ya'll know I'm all like support your people."],["I enjoy this movie because it reminded me of my life when I was in my thirties.  This is one of the those movies that I watch over and over again.  The cast is great.  The story line is great.  I enjoy seeing black people who are successful and beautiful."],["I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE. AS A FIFTY PLUS  MALE; I FIND IT DELIGHTFUL TO SEE YOUNG BLACK ACTORS PERFORMING AS INTELLIGENT RESPONSIBLE INDIVIDUALS. THE CHALLENGES THEY FACED IN THIS MOVIE CONTRAST THE \"GUN CARRYING, TRYING TO GET OVER THUGS\" THAT HOLLYWOOD SEEMS TO PUSH AS BLOCKBUSTERS. I DID'T APPROVE OF THE PROFANITY NOR THE CAUSAL SEX SCENES. BUT, THIS MOVIE IS CERTAINLY A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION."],["30 Years to Life is a cute romantic comedy that follows the lives of six African American friends as they approach thirty years old in New York City.  The cast consists Allen Payne, Tracy Morgan, Kadeem Hardison, Erica Alexander, Paula Jai Parker, T. Russell and Melissa De Sousa.  As you can tell from the cast names and if you know their filmographies...then you know that all of these people can really act.  So they have taken and crafted each character into a believable individual that most will be able to identify with.The movie covers the span of one year.  It begins with a birthday celebration and ends with one.  You get an inside view of what women want in a relationship and also what men want.  It is hilarious as the characters portray the most shallow to something of substance.  Sometimes all that we think we want in a person (outer trappings like money, career, good looks)...does not enhance the inner person (inner qualities like politeness, caring, considerate, loving, giving and unselfishness).  Paula's character deals with being a great person inside (and a great cook), but overlooked by most men because she is overweight.  She has an extreme make over which takes her on an enlightening journey to get the man of her dreams.  Tracy's character seems to be a non-committal jerk, trying to break into the comedy business and bumming money from women...but later he reveals why a broke brother does what he does (a self-esteem kinda thing...issues).  Erika's character  lives with her boyfriend of four years.  She wants to get married, but he does not.  He goes to buy her a bracelet and is accidently given another customer's ring purchase.  So he does not have the heart to tell his girlfriend that their engagement was a mistake, fake, crazy mix-up...this was deep.  Allen's character quits a good job to follow his dream of being a model.  He is also a womanizer that has left a trail of loved them &amp; left them.  He is forced to see the damage that his one night stands causes to women with good intentions.  Melissa's character discovers that one must be careful what they pray for because you just might get it...and it might not be a pretty picture.In the course of one year each character grows older, but will they grow wiser and more mature?  I enjoyed this one and highly recommend it. Paula &amp; Tracy really came out of the box with their performances and I look forward to more from them in the future."],["Great cast featuring all actors, no musicians or rap stars with a great story and comedy delivery from the actors.  I think it was well written, well shot, and just all out a great movie.  I saw it the first weekend it came to Atlanta, GA, and me being an aspiring film maker I was very impressesed.  I hope to see more African-American movies like this."],["Six friends in NY face the emotions of turning 30. I could so identify with this movie. I'm 36, so a lot of what some of the characters were dealing with in this film, I've dealt with them or know others who have. 30 years to life starts with a birthday and ends with a birthday. At the beginning of the movie Natalie comes home from work to a surprise birthday party. Instead of being happy she screams &quot;I'm 30&quot; and runs away crying. Usually birthdays are reasons to celebrate, for Natalie she is facing the fact that she &quot;Has an MBA, A Great well paying job, and is in great shape, but why is she not happy or married.&quot; Natalie really wants to be in a relationship, but she has trouble in the relationship area. Natalie is not the only character dealing with being 30 or about to turn 30. You have Joy who is in a 4 year relationship, but she really wants to be married to Leland. Joy has convinced herself that they do not need that piece of paper to label their relationship (man if I had a nickel for every time I heard that line I would be RICH). Leland feels if they get married, everything will change in the relationship, so he is comfortable with just living together the way they have been. Bottom line is he is scared!!! Malik is a marketing executive who has a negative idea about relationships. He sees relationships as &quot;leasing with the option to buy&quot;, and he goes out of his way to NOT put himself in a situation where the relationship can get serious. However, he has no problems sleeping with woman, after woman, and forgets the names of some women. Malik works in Marketing and gets a promotion. He does not like how his career is mapped out for him over the next 10 years. He was informed of his career path and his projected salary by the time he was 40! He quits his job to pursue his dream of being a model. Troy is a broke actor comedian who is always trying to borrow money from women, and steals food from his friends. Don't expect him to pay the tab if you go out to eat. He can't cover his part of the bill. Stephanie is a successful real estate agent who has been dealing with weight issues all her life. To hide her pain she makes jokes about her weight before anyone else can start, but she longs to live happy and slimmer like her other female friends do.Joy finally admits to Leland that she wants to get married and it's a huge weight lifted off her shoulders. Now he is feeling the pressure to get her an engagement ring. Leland &quot;Accidentally&quot; gets Joy an engagement ring, and when lets her know it was a mistake she breaks up with him. Stephanie loses weight and suddenly she is getting attention from men and loves it. Nicole is dating a doctor who loves to be served and taken care of (by Kadeem Hardison), but when her job performance suffers she has to make a choice.The movie is could be depressing for some, but for me I laughed a lot. There is a stigma to turning 30, and I happen to enjoy being in my 30's. The movie is about reflection, about taking chances, and about being honest to yourself about what you truly want in life. I enjoyed the movie so much I watched it twice before I returned it, and I plan to purchase my own copy. This is a good film.There is a hilarious scene that involves a 6th toe on the foot of one of the characters. Janet Hubert (Aunt Viv #1 from the Fresh Prince of Bell Air) plays Joys Mom in the movie. Music artist Monifah makes a quick appearance. Blink and you will miss her, it's that quick.There is another scene that Joy shares with her Mom discussing her just living with her boyfriend. Joy is trying to justify it, but some really great lines come out we all may have heard over and over. &quot;That's your problem you're afraid you are going to scare him off. You know it's what you want (marriage) I can see it in your eyes.&quot; &quot;For a man sex outside of marriage is like finding money. If no one claims it you will be spending it until it's all gone.&quot; &quot;Why buy something you can get for free.&quot;The DVD has no significant extras. You get a filmography of the actors in the movie. It would have been nice to get some film commentary from the director and the actors in the movie. The movie stars Ericka Alexander (Living Single, Cosby show), Melissa De Sousa (The Best Man, Miss Congeniality), Tracy Morgan (The Tracy Morgan Show, SNL, Head of State), Paula Jai Parker (Proud Family, Friday, My Baby Daddy, Phone Booth), Allen Payne (Blue Hill Avenue, Cosby Show, Jasons Lyric, Vampire in Brooklyn, New Jack City), TE Russel (City of Angels), Kadeem Hardison (A Different World, Vampire in Brooklyn, White Men Can't Jump, Biker Boyz)"],["Good movie to watch with friends.Erika Alexander's character was allot different from other characters she's played giving the movie a great deal of dept."],["Wow! What a really great movie! Expect really great acting from Erica Alexander, Allen Payne, Tracy Morgan, really the entire cast. A group of friends deal with the range of emotions from turning 30 years old. From crying at the birthday candles to quitting your job, to chase the elusize dream of your youth. This is a great movie, my husband and I really identified with it."],["I'm a fan of ensemble movies (movies with a variety of major cast members) so I was pleased to come across this flick. I'm not usually a fan of comedies, however, preferring thriller/suspense types. But when I need a little break, movies like this get the job done. Pretty decent story lines and acting. Funny situations with some relationship drama mixed in. Not a perfect script but it kept my attention, and if it came on TV in a year or two I'd probably watch it again."],["Maybe I was expecting something else.  This movie I gave away after watching it.  Perhaps becuase I'm over 40 I simply was not moved by it. But for those who are approaching that societal age of 30 I imagine it would be enjoyable."],["When I first saw this movie I wasn't impressed but I began to appreciate it more and more as I watched it several times.  I find it to be very funny.  Someone forgot to cover the actor's mark in the scene where the couple is at the hotel.  If you are careful you might find yourself or people you know in this movie.

Lewis. The story is told in flashbacks from the memory of an elderly Lewis, and the exquisite script is mostly culled from his writings. It makes one marvel at the beauty of the English language, and how descriptive it is. The scenes flow well, and though it is a mere sketch of a very complex and full life, one gets the sense of who Lewis was, how he lived, and the friends he knew, like J. R. R. Tolkien. He met Joy Davidman, an American mother of 2, in his later years, and this relationship brought Lewis love, as well as a crisis of faith, which is expressed with depth and sensitivity.Anton Rodgers as Lewis, and Diane Venora as Joy give remarkable performances. There is an intimacy and realism to their portrayals that make the biography come alive, and stir our emotions. The direction by Norman Stone is excellent, and the production gives one the feel of what the first half of the 20th century in England was like. Co-produced by Faith and Values Media for the Hallmark Channel, and filmed in locations where Lewis worked and lived, \"Beyond Narnia\" is a gentle film that will be appreciated by anyone who admires his books, or those who enjoy literate scripts and good acting."],["Have you read the Chronicles of Narnia to your children?  Have they seen the movies?  Have they become Lewis fans?  This DVD will introduce them to the man behind lion.  It is entertaining, honest, and revealing.  Your children will come away with a greater understanding of one of Christianity's greatest authors and a deeper understanding of the Christian faith.  After showing it to your children, you will come away with a sense of accomplishment.  Take advantage of this fine \"teaching moment\"."],["Since I had read various books and articles by C.S. Lewis and had seen the video Shadowlands, I bought this particular video because it further explained the background re his relationship with his wife whom he met through correspondence with her.Also Beyond Narnia showed how his childhood interest in animals and their ability to express moral thoughts helped him to write the Narnia tales.  For those who like C.S. Lewis, this is a beautiful portrayal of the author and his times.  A. M. Seidler"],["This story appeared to be made by non-Christian director/producer since CS Lewis' Christian faith was not shown from Christian view. This product may be targeted for non-Christians. I was looking for CS Lewis' Christian life story; how he was converted, what experience made him converted etc. How he was moved as he was writing Narnia story.So it was disappointing."],["For an hour long documentary this is not bad, it is not great either.  The actor portraying Lewis - Anton Rogers is very good.  The story is not great.  The facts are there, but they have been cut and pasted to fit into the time frame and the goal of the writer/director/producer, etc.  Small facts that are not quite true are given, which may lead one to believe things about Lewis which were not true.  However, this is TV and only an hour.  It is worth a watch, rent it, check your library, do not buy unless you are getting a great deal.  Two very good documentaries are The Life of C.S. Lewis by Day of Discovery - [...] and C.S. Lewis: The Dreamer of Narnia - comes with The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe extended edition DVD."],["I like this DVD and am glad I bought it."],["I ordered this per the reviews I read and I am happy to say that my husband and I are both delighted...thank you!"],["I actually thought that the actor portraying Lewis WAS Lewis when I started watching it. This is a must see for fans of C.S. Lewis, giving wonderful insight into the genesis of his Narnia tales, as well as his many adult books. His short, happy life with his wife Joy plays an important part in the story, as does his response to her loss."],["This is a summary of the life of C.S. Lewis in the style of a narrative/flashback told by Mr. Lewis near the end of his life.When I first popped in the disc and saw \"BBC,\" I was preparing myself for the below-par quality that I've come to expect from U.K. comedies on late-night PBS specials. But within five minutes, I was hooked. Being an avid C.S. Lewis fan myself, I was pleased that nearly all of the monologue from the actor who played the older Mr. Lewis was taken word-for-word from the works and letters of C.S. Lewis and arranged in such a way as to give explain the life of Lewis to the viewer. Even the dialogue in the flashbacks appears to be inspired by the real words and letters of Lewis.The actors did a superb job. The older Mr. Lewis, who also appears in the flashbacks, did an excellent job at times describing and other times depicting the range of emotions the real Lewis went through: happiness, love, sadness, wonder, apathy, all of these were captured in his voice and his expressions. The director also did a wonderful job depicting scenes from World War I while Lewis describes how the war cemented his Atheism as a young man.Three other scenes in particular stood out to me. The first was shortly after the death of the young Lewis' mother and depicts his father alone in a study, debilitated by his grief and unable to console his grieving children \"who desperately needed their father's love and attention.\"The second was the scene of the night on which Lewis converted to belief in God (not Christianity, just Theism). The young Lewis (played by a different actor than the old) is shown in his study, tormented by the pressing reality of God. The acting and directing were superb in capturing the tension that C.S. Lewis described when he said that this was the night he became \"the most dejected and reluctant convert in all of England.\"The third scene was when Lewis' wife, Joy Gresham Lewis, dies of cancer. The actor who played the older Lewis, who up to this point has seemed quite inspirational, now displays Lewis' anger and apathy toward God that followed his wife's death; as well as his restoration to a more vivid, mature faith in God.My only complaint with this video is its brevity. At 54 minutes, it does a tremendous job showing the highlights of Lewis' life, but another half hour would have been well received. While the video does contain brief depictions of Lewis' friendship with J.R.R. Tolkien and his involvement with an intellectual club, \"The Inklings,\" I wish the video had spent more time on Lewis' relationship with other friends such as Charles Williams, Owen Barfield, Hugo Dyson, and Lewis life-long friend Arthur Greeves who is never so much as mentioned. The video also never depicts the event that catapulted Lewis fame to new heights as a Christian apologist during the 40's when he was asked to do a series of talks on Christianity for BBC radio that were eventually compiled into one his most popular works, \"Mere Christianity.\" A pivotal event in Lewis' life as a Christian apologist, it is quite neglected.But with all of these criticisms, it should be noted that with only under an hour, the movie is surprisingly extensive in its breadth of material that is covered.This video will give any new Lewis initiates a concise, but surprisingly comprehensive overview of his life. And for more mature fans, such as myself, it brings life to Lewis' words. This DVD does not disappoint."],["This is an excellent program that gives surprising background to the author and his methods. Well done and very interesting. I was not familiar with the author before these movies, butI am certainly impressed with his work."],["I was prepared not to like this DVD, as it seemed to be yet another attempt to tie into Lewisania and the recent film of the Chronicles of Narnia. After all, what could be the point of a DVD that lasts only an hour, and what could be said that hasn't already been said?  But this film instantly drew me in and quickly disarmed me. It's not a documentary in the general sense of the word, but is built around Anton Rogers, as C. S. Lewis, recalling his life, and segues into various scenes.Anton Rogers plays Lewis far better than Anthony Hopkins, and instead of sets, the shots are on location at Oxford, including the Eagle and Child pub where Lewis met with \"Tollers\" (J.R.R. Tolkien), Charles Williams and the other writers and friends known as the Inklings. My title comes from one of the numerous great lines Rogers says throughout the film, which seems largely drawn from Lewis' two autobiographies, Surprised By Joy and All My Road Before Me, as well as A Grief Observed, which he wrote after his wife Joy's death, and originally published under a pseudonym.The last was a difficult time for Lewis, and the handling here, while necessarily telegraphic in such a brief film, is better than in Shadowlands, where it was played solely for effect. I found the ending somewhat unsatisfactory, but it's probably difficult to tie up at that point when in fact Lewis wrote more books and lectured for some time after. This film assumes one has read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, and refers to it as the first Narnian Chronicle, which it originally was, having been written in 1950. The recent reordering of the books to follow chronological events in Narnia has caused some confusion, but of course, all one needs to do is read them in the old order. That said, this DVD is like opening the wardrobe again, as it takes one further up and further in, beyond Narnia."],["This story of the author, C. S. Lewis telling his life story and how he came to write &#34;The Chronicles of Narnia&#34;, was heartwarming. It put a face and depicted the life of a man who was the creator of these inspiring books and later movies. It also shows what the life of a book writer/author was like in those times and how they inspired each other. Alot of very famous and creative authors came out of this era."],["One of the many benefits of reading the entire series of The Chronicles of Narnia is that you get to glimpse the playful side of this brilliant man the world knew as C.S. Lewis.  By viewing Beyond Narnia, you get to see the fullness of his brain, his life and his soul.  Grab a box of tissues before you sit down to this life-changing film"],["I really can't tell more than if you want a brief but good view into the life of C.S. Lewis then purchase this video. As a pastor I have used the last lines spoken in the movie by Lewis at a few funerals. This due to the fact that as a christian it really speaks to the one simple fact that this is not the last chapter in our life , but the first of many great ones. But you get a good insight to C.S. Lewis' writing..... Why, How, When etc. You probably won't be disappointed."],["What is best about this DVD is that character of C.S. Lewis protrayed said exactly what C.S. Lewis would say, because they were word for word quotes from his books, mostly from his autobiographySurprised by Joy: The Shape of My Early Lifepublished by C. S. Lewis in 1955.The worst about this DVD was the very distracting artificial flickering from an unseen fireplace while Lewis was chatting in his armchair in his living room."],["Beyond Narnia is a captivating movie where C. S. Lewis is presented as an older man looking back and telling the story of his life. There are cuts back and forth from the autobiographical narrator and those acting out the scenes.Over the years I have seen several videos about C. S. Lewis. I have read many hundreds of pages. And here are all the facts told in an orderly way. The film is easy to understand and very engaging. The sets and costumes help tell the visual story as the narrator talks.This movie is recommended for all those who want to understand the live of C S Lewis both as the writer of the Narnia Chronicles as well as his many other books. Understanding his spiritual pilgrimage can provide a greater context to more fully appreciate the soil of his life that the fruits of his labors came from in his complex walk with God."],["Unless you are a Narnia freak, this is a pure waste of money. I would suggest sticking to the movies."],["Saw it many years ago so used it for the basis of a discussion on C.S. L @ church, leading to a study of some of his books."],["The tragic saddness of C.S.'s loss of wife and faith in Shadowlands,maybe to tough on younger viewer's but still an important reality for those in Christ.This movie allows all age's to see and feel the loss without holding the viewer to long in the sorrow.Older viewer's should own both Shadowlands,and Beyond Narnia the work of Christ is important in the life of believers yet the truth of suffering is good in C.S.'s life and the viewer get's to see the hand of God in this movie which is more personal in Beyond Narnia."],["I bought this DVD used  (ExpressMedia).  It took a while to get here (ordered Dec 22 and received Jan 10) which is fine, I guess.  My concern is that the bonus features were not accessible.  Can't figure out why since I was playing it on a computer which they said was required.  I &#34;suspect&#34; that this was a copy so perhaps that is why the bonus features weren't working.  Oh well, learned my lesson.  Won't be ordering used DVDs any more.  This was my first time and will be my last."],["It's remarkable how ordinary and seemingly insignificant events prove pivotal, and in God's economy part of his grand design.  Such is the case in the life of C.S. Lewis.  He wrote, \"I always believed that miracles can happen.  You just have to be at the right place at the right time.\"The tragic loss of his mother led to a cruel English boarding school experience.  Begging to leave, he came out into the spacious freedom of a demanding but beloved tutor, who inspired a love of learning and knowledge.  It served as preparation for Oxford University.His education was interrupted by what was called \"The Great War.\"  Did the tragedy and horror of it confirm his atheism?  Wounded in battle, he returned to his studies and Christian friends like J.R.R. Tolkien, who challenged his atheistic assumptions.His defenses began to crumble when he realized that not only were his best friends Christian, his favorite books were written by Christian authors.  He could no longer deny God's existence and felt the pressure of God's pursuit.He had been filled with trepidation at the thought of becoming a believer, but in 1929 he reluctantly surrendered.  It was anything but joyous.But years later, after a career in writing had emerged, he agreed to meet with an American woman who had written him.  This seemingly insignificant event would forever change his life.  He was at the right place at the right time.  Joy Gresham would become his friend, and later to make it possible for her to stay in England, Lewis agreed to a hasty \"paper\" marriage.It was the tragedy of Joy's cancer that brought their love to the surface, which led to a real marriage before God.  At last Lewis would know the joy in his sixties that he had been denied in his twenties.  This pleasure would prove to be fleeting, as Joy's recovery was only temporary.She eventually succumbed leaving Lewis to question the faith he had espoused and defended.  In back of all the twists and turns in his life, stood the God who helped Lewis and his stepchildren carry on.All of these scenes and more are beautifully depicted in this dramatic presentation.  Amazingly, it condenses into 54 minutes all the periods and highlights of his life.  The pacing is even and relaxed; it never feels rushed.This is not a documentary.  An assortment of actors, including a man who looks like an older Lewis, vividly and expertly recreate his life.The promotional DVD copy opens with an advertisement for this production and did not have any of the bonus features listed on the box.  This includes Lewis and Narnia trivia, information about Lewis and a few other items related to the Narnia books.The presentation opens with Lewis as a child exploring an old cottage.  Then it flashes forward to 1963 with the older Lewis narrating his story.  The different episodes are played out in between narration and commentary.  Lewis serves as a guide; everything comes to us from his perspective.As you might expect, this is more realistic and less dramatic than \"Shadowlands,\" the popular Hollywood version of his life.  It also has a warmth and production that exceeds the PBS story.  This may be the best and is probably the most concise depiction of Lewis on film.Those who know his story may not learn anything new, but this works because it's well-done, entertaining and realistic.  It's a loving depiction that serves as a great follow-up to the \"Narnia\" movie.  It takes us beyond Narnia to show us the miracle of the life behind it."],["This is almost like sitting down with CS Lewis for a chat. I love seeing it and sharing it with friends."],["I thorough enjoyed this book which was very meaningful to me.  (1)  I cried a great deal because it brought back so many memories of my dearly departed Enlish wife and (2)  we lived for a period of time in Oxford so this brought back many happy memories as well.  Highly recommend, in fact I purchased this particular DVD for my dear female friend."],["The trouble with many documentaries on religious figures or events is that in our era of religious suspicion much of the spirituality is washed out to make a movie more \"accessible\" to a wide audience. In doing this these documentaries miss the mark, and create a figure or event entirely unhistorical. The reality about C.S. Lewis is he was a Christian. Not only this, he was a Christian apologist, a man who spent a significant part of his life convincing others about Christianity.That core reality is found in this documentary. Indeed, this movie may have been better titled, \"In His Own Words\", for having read the bulk of Lewis' writings I recognized significant parts. Think of this movie as a very uncluttered dramatization of Surprised by Joy, A Grief Observed, and a selection of his letters.C.S. Lewis saw his own identity being defined by his faith. He was fascinating, he himself argued, precisely because of his Christianity. This movie, without holding back, gets right to the heart of Lewis' own self-understanding, and as such is a wonderful hour spent with a very intriguing and influential scholar, writer, theologian, and evangelist."],["Being familiar with all of C.S.Lewis's mainstream published autobiographical work and a wide variety of biographical material I delighted in the movie 'Beyond Narnia'.  It is truly head and shoulders above all previous television and film dramatization of Lewis's life not only because it is more accurate to that period already covered by previous dramatization, but it also involves the fascinating period of Lewis's childhood and youth.  Additionally, to add further 'icing on the cake', the casting of the actors used, particularly that of Anton Rodgers as Lewis, was vastly superior to anything that has preceded it on screen (particularly the big screen - Anthony Hopkins, in both appearance and demeanor, couldn't have been less suited to the role)."],["I have seen this about four times now, and am still moved to tears of joy when viewing it.  The Jesus to whom C. S. Lewis introduces us is full of life, power, grace, and joy.  If you enjoy Lewis' writing, then you will certainly love this autobiographical journey into the heart and mind of a great literary figure, one with whom most folks could easily imagine sharing a good mug of ale and a hearty laugh.  The most moving aspect of Lewis' theology is the fact that he does not present an other-worldly, escapist picture, but integrates the pains and uncertainty of life with the presentation of a warm, personable, and caring Lord who walks with us through suffering and sorrow with the excitement of knowing the incredible wonder of our destination."],["As a child, my father would read me books by C.S. Lewis that you would assume would be far beyond a child's understanding and yet at a young age, this writer captured my heart. His Narnia books birthed in me a love for reading and his life is an interesting study in soul growth and maturing through life's complexity.In this brief dramatized introduction to his life, we enter a world where C.S. Lewis talks about his life while sitting by a fireplace. This has the feeling of a fireside chat with portrayals of C.S. Lewis' discovery of true love, his life as a writer and his struggles to accept the reality of God's existence, all while he says he was angry at God for not existing. There are some great moments of humor throughout.If you have read the work of C.S. Lewis, especially \"A Grief Observed,\" then \"Beyond Narnia\" presents a deeper understanding of how C.S. Lewis lost the woman he loved. I found myself caught up in the tragic romance, the intimacy of the conversations and the stories of his life in Oxford.The filming locations are beautiful, libraries and historic settings add intrigue. I suppose the only thing I felt a little distracted by was how C.S. Lewis' beliefs about God were presented. While most of the aspects of his conversion from atheism to Christianity seem correct, I think at the point at which he would have been telling his story, he would have been less critical of God. Reading Mere Christianity gives a much more in depth look at his true feelings.It seems true to say that the more you learn about C.S. Lewis, the more fascinated you become. This docudrama doesn't really address the Chronicles of Narnia in detail, nor does it really explore any of C.S. Lewis' writing. This is more about his childhood, his personal relationship with God and his understanding of grief. When you think about, how many authors could so influence a life? Not only are his children's books completely fascinating, his writings on spirituality are some of the most profound literary moments I've ever encountered. Each time I take time to study more about C.S. Lewis, I find myself even more curious about this fascinating author who has so influenced my life.So, I can recommend this to you if you are studying C.S. Lewis' life or you are curious about his childhood, marriage and emotional life. If you are looking for extensive details about the Chronicles of Narnia, you may be disappointed.~The Rebecca Review"],["This is exceptionally good DVD for two classes of potential viewers:  first for those who have not read or heard much of the background of Narnia's genius C.S. Lewis, this will introduce them in very well done intro to the life that produced this wonderful series.  It is filmed in many of the actual locations where he lived and wrote, and is historically very accurate.For those of us who are familiar with this background material already, I also commend this video, as it was great to see the actual footage and the portrayal by Anton Rogers is hauntingly good.The final scene is especially poignant, from the Final Battle entering into eternity there are chapters that only get better and better.The bonus features accessible by personal computer with DVD capabiblity are good also."],["This is a good documentary that any fan of C.S. Lewis, and particularly his Narnian books, will enjoy.  I recommend it."],["It gave a great background on Lewis & it was well done.  I'm going to use it as extra credit when I teach his Great Divorce."],["I would recommend buying a copy to every church library which asdpires to be in earnest.  It almost comes as a surprise that the actors are just that, so true a portrayal do they make.  In this condensed version of Lewis' life one is able to ascertain the Hand of God moving in his life and giving it direction.  This is particularly noticeable when one considers the parallels that appear = notably the search for joy, the appearance of two brothers who are beset by circumstances, the two mothers who die an early death.  One wonders whether this is not really about Lewis or rather the eternal vision that his stepson Douglas will carry forward, as Lewis' heir."],["I teach Lewis' Space Trilogy and Narnia Chronicles in different college courses and have, in the past, shown _The Magic Never Ends_ as an introduction to Lewis' life and beliefs. _The Magic Never Ends_ is very good, but a bit long and in need of some editing. I do value its unflinching declaration of Lewis' beliefs and clear articulation of the gospel._Beyond Narnia_ is dramatized - narrated by an older Lewis and complemented with flashbacks. It is a wonderful overview of Lewis' life and struggles - entertaining and accessible, engaging and moving. It wraps you into his life and makes you care about his struggles and triumphs. At the same time it presents his faith clearly, though it doesn't discuss Christianity with as much force as _The Magic Never Ends_. I especially appreciate that, though _Beyond Narnia_ deals with Joy's death and Lewis' reaction as outlined in _A Grief Observed_ it, unlike _Shadowlands_, clearly shows that Lewis returned to his faith in God.My class of adult degree-completion students absolutely loved this film, and I did too. It's a basic, clear depiction with great emotional impact that stays very true to who Lewis was and the life he lived."],["C.S. Lewis is my favorite author, bar none.  I have never read anything by Lewis that I didn't like and I always learn something from reading his writings. He forces you to think.  But who was the man behind the writings?  That's what BEYOND NARNIA explores.  This short DVD (about 55 minutes) examines key experiences from Lewis' life by having Lewis himself (portrayed by an actor) tell us through a series of reenacted scenes from his life.  The idyllic early years of his childhood, the death of his mother, his years at boarding school, the tutelage under the Great Knock, the Great War, his years of teaching, his friendship with J.R.R. Tolkien, and his relationship with his eventual wife, Joy, are all discussed.  More time is spent on some of these areas than others, but each of them provides insight who Lewis was. Even though I knew most of the information and had read most of the stories, I really enjoyed BEYOND NARNIA. It's short, but quite accurate.  It's educational and entertaining without being dry.  Highly recommended for fans of Lewis, fans of Narnia, or as a way to introduce people to who Lewis was."],["This was professionally made and the footage appears to be mostly on locations where CS Lewis lived and worked. Most of the lines delivered by the actor portraying Jack were right out of his written works. Only one puzzle hit me and that was the abreviated approach to his conversion. It seemed to skip over which books and discussions had a great influence on him. It suggested his change of mind occurred in his room while I have often heard it happened while traveling one day, but maybe this was a different issue. Overall, this is a nice summary of his life."]],"title":"C.S.

But I am not out of shape and I like to dance and do Pilates based exercises. I you are a bit out of shape or need something more challenging, this is challenging. And you will \"shock your legs\" like another reviewer said. I think that this one gives you a bit too much of muscle legs."],["This is a great workout!  Press the \"Play all\" and you get a great 60 minute work out.  The six intervales really get your heart pumping and make you sweat and this is what takes off the pounds, along with a healthy diet.  The strength training segment is also done very well.  In order to reach your weight loss goals you have to make the commitment to exercise.After having my second child, I put on 55 pounds more than I wanted to.  I work out each day in the early AM, following high aerobic DVD's.  I changed my way of eating, more fruits and veges, lean meats, cut out white flour and cut way back on white sugar.  I have lost the extra 55 lbs of baby weight, and an additional 20 lbs!  I feel better than ever!Great job again Chris, I would recommend any of your workouts!"],["I have done this workout a couple times now and I have to say I am very impressed. It really works your thighs and hips well. I have the sore muscles today from doing it last night. I work out regularly at the gym (doing elliptical and jogging) and I like that I can do strength training in the comfort of my home and still get a good workout."],["I am very pleased with this video.  In the cardio segment, I like that there are 6 different intervals (about 6 minutes each)....it helps to keep your workout from getting monotonous.  Plus, I like the varying of intensity in each interval.  The toning segment is also great and is definitely challenging."],["awesome workout... love that it starts each interval slow so you can learn the moves.  6 min sesseions, low impact, then high, then a cardio blast for 60 seconds.  you have 6 differnt intervals  .. do all 6 or work your way up to them.  also enjoy the lower body section."],["This is yet another great workout that Prevention have put out.  It's great, fun and enjoyable and best of all, you'll get results if you do this often enough.  To be honest, it isn't this dvd that will get rid of cellulite - it's excerise in general (enough of it).This has a lot of interval routines and toning for your thighs and glutes.  Chris Freytag continuously changes moves so you don't get bored and you get the most from the workout.  The six minute intervals get a little more intense each time which keeps you on your toes.  Overall it's around about an hour if you do it all in it's entirety.  I find it pretty effective and it kept me puffing a little and encouraged because Chris is a great instructor.You can always do lower impact moves if you aren't fit or want to slow things down.  Either way, you'll get a great workout and the mere fact that you are getting your blood flowing through your body and toning your legs, it will make cellulite almost disappear and be much smoother.  I really like this one."],["I have quite a few of her dvds, which I &#34;utilize&#34; constantly, and there are days when you want a great workout, withoutkilling your knees(i.e. Jillian, Bob and Shaun). Not to mention, still get a good workout!"],["This is one of the better fitness DVD's I have purchased.  Consistant, upbeat, the rarity of actually working the left and the right evenly, (most videos don't from the ones I have purchased in the past.)  Good for all levels, acutally points out on more than one occasion the person doing the lower impact and lower intensity moves.  Not for the weak kneed.  Really gets the heart rate going, like the fact that it is done in interval style, so you actually can get the fat burning effect.  Wide variety of movements, not just your squats and lunges.  Chris isn't overly exuberant, overly chipper, nor is her personality cold.  She does try to stay informative, encouraging and doesn't make false promises during the workout.  What kept me from giving it a 5,  Chris seems to be out of breath already during the warmup, some of her chit-chat can be annoying, (but there is not one tape out there whose instructor doesn't hit a nerve on some days,) really wish the stretches were held longer during the cool down.  Will definately look into some of the other ones she has out."],["This workout is organized very well into six segments and really is alot of fun.  It starts out with a low-impact routine for 2 1/2 minutes and then the routine is repeated high-impact style for 2 1/2 minutes.  However, you could just repeat it low-impact again if you prefer.  It is very fun, the time goes by quickly,and I'm sweating like a dog at the end.  I consider myself an intermediate exercise who really likes fairly basic moves.  I think anyone beginner or intermediate would really enjoy this dvd.  Even a more advanced could \"pump it up\" to cater to their level.  This reminds me of her previous 3-2-1 workout in that it's divided in to the six segments.  I really like that, I know how much I have completed and how far I have to go.After the cardio it has upper body strengthing and a lower body section.  There may be one more, but so far I have only done the cardio on this."],["When I purchase this product I thought it would work without the requirement to stay on their web program, I felt after 3 months the program wasn't worth $6.95 per month. If you don't pay $6.95 per month after the 3 month trial period the product will no longer work, so you if you don't plan on spending $6.95 per month don't buy it. What a rip off, I don't need some computer to keep track of my activity. I thought that is what I bought the core and wrist band to do daily."],["I've only used this dvd once and it's already my favorite workout dvd. I could only do 5 minutes before completely losing my breath. I did the low impact for the next 15 minutes and I had to quit. It's worth the money. I'm going to continue using it and hope to see a reduction in cellulite, but either way it is a great work out."],["After trying Chris Freytag's Walk Yourself Fit DVD and being unimpressed, I was really skeptical of this one. I was wrong!  The cardio is great, and not too short to be effective or too long to fit in to my morning workout.  I definitely recommend this one."],["I bought the 'Fight Cellulite Fast' workout because I wanted a more challenging workout. This workout delivers that and more. I am middle aged and need a serious workout to fend off all the stiffness that comes with age. On days that I am really stiff and sore, I can follow along with the modified workout, days when I am in top form, I can keep up with Chris' upbeat prompting.This is one of my favorite workouts."],["It has warmup, 35min cardio, 15min legs with weights that you can use for arm movements too, and then cool down. Cardio is fun, not complicated plus she repeats moves in a circuit so you learn quick. Intensity varies too. That leg workout is a killer. My behind is sore today :)"],["This is an awesome workout DVD.  What I like about it...the instructor has a pleasant voice, is not overly hyper, cues well, and the workout left me sweating hard and I didn't even make it through all the cardio before moving on to lower body toning. I like that there is a person to follow if you aren't quite to the high level the instructor is.  I also modify moves when I need to (a knee injury keeps me from doing the low squats and the twists) and just keep going at the pace set and do what I can do when they are doing something I can't.  It is one of the best work out dvds that I've done and that's saying a lot because I own about 30 of them and I've been through and got rid of many times that.Here is the one thing I don't like about this work out and it's a mistake I think too many workout DVD's make...the wordy descriptions at the beginning of each segment about what is to come.  It interrupts the flow. It's fine the first time you do the workout to get an idea of what is to come and to learn about something but by the time you've done the workout 5-10 times, you get really annoyed to hear the same thing over and over and finding the remote to fast forward just creates a negative energy for me. They need to make a seperate section of the DVD that talks about all that, explains the sections of the DVD and leave it out of the actual workout.  When they make the workout and play it back they need to listen to it and say okay, is this something one would want to hear over and over if they make this workout part of their regular routine?  If the answer is no, leave it out or move it to it's own section of the DVD that you can skip over."],["I own a few of the Prevention Fitness System DVDs and this is by far the best.  The cardio is great.  I am a intermediate/advanced exerciser and it gets my heart rate up.  At 40 minutes it is a good length.  The toning is only 15 minutes or so but gets the legs and butt to burn a bit.  I would get this for the cardio.  You don't need too much room axcept in the first interval, but you can always modify.  As always Chris is great with queuing and gives you time to get used to the move before adding on.  She is one of the least annoying fitness instructors out there."],["This is a 2-part workout with a 36-minute cardio and approximately 15-minute lower-body toning, plus a warm up and cool down.  I did the toning workout only once, so I don't have much to say about that part.  I love the cardio workout because it's pure cardio with tons of variety - none of the exercises are repeated across the segments.The cardio workout contains 6 segments that are approximately 6 minutes each.  Each segment is broken down into 3 individual segments: the first is a series of low-impact moves (about 2 minutes 30 seconds), the second takes those same moves and makes them high-impact with some jumping and hopping (about 2 minutes 30 seconds), the third is the power blast which is usually one or two of the moves done at high-impact/intensity (about 45-60 seconds).Chris's queing is great, letting you know what's coming up so you can make the transition and keep moving.  She has two people exercising with her and the modifier is shown frequently.  They all smile through the entire workout (I bet you won't though!), and I can only image that there's someone off-camera constantly yelling \"keep smiling!\".You're moving the entire 36 minutes of this workout, even during the transitions between segments when you're marching in place.  It definitely gets your heart rate elevated, and you can increase the intensity by doing the high-impact moves the entire time (you have to remember those on your own, Chris only gives you the high-impact moves during that portion of the segment).  I have also added light hand weights (about 2 pounds) to increase the intensity even more.I gave this DVD 4 stars instead of 5 only because the DVD should have been set up so that you could design your own workout by selecting the order of the segments and repeating segments to get a longer workout. So the 4 stars instead of 5 is for the functionality of the DVD itself.  The workout is great and merits 5 stars.  You will definitely get results if you do it 3+ times a week."],["Love this workout! Chris Freytag is a great instructor and her cueing is dead on. I liked having the option to do the modifications while still keeping my heart rate up. The first segment is six 6 minute intervals which start out at level 1 (low intensity) and go up to level 3 (high intensity) with power bursts. The second segment is primarily squats and lunges and is really hard on the knees, so be wary. I wish she would have done some other butt shaping exercises other than endless squats. Still, her enthusiasm is contagious and even on a slow day I find myself trying to complete the six minute circuits. This is worth the try."],["An amazing workout! This one is still a challenge to do even after a year. This workout hits everything, and the lower body workout in the end is a challenge but well worth it!"],["I am a very athletic person - I workout daily (30-40 minutes on an elliptical and some light lifting).  I've been trying various different workout DVDs and they always seem to be so easy that I end up adding wrist and ankle weights to give me a challenge.  This DVD is certainly challenging!  I got it today and tried it after my normal cardio workout.  After 4 minutes, my thighs and butt felt like they were on fire and I actually had to stop!  I clearly need to build up my muscle in these areas, but I'm going to continue to stick with it and I'm very much looking forward to seeing results!"],["I love this product, you really are going to sweat and feel your muscle sore, but you still have to make diet to lose weight. Do not think that a video will erase your cellulitis, it will help alot if you take care of what you eat.

I do the cardio one day and the legs workout the next mixed with the arm workout."],["I really like this dvd, It will get your body moving and the calorie burn is GREAT! I workout with Chris 6 days a week."],["This is a combination of one 36-minute high-energy cardio workout and one 15-minute targeted strength routine, in addition to a 4-minute warm up and a 4 minute cool down, designed to burn calories and minimize the appearance of cellulite.The cardio workout offers six 5-minute routines designed to elevate your heart rate and get you burning calories.  The lower-body strength routine focuses on toning and tightening your hips, thighs and buttocks with the use of medium weighted (5-8lbs) hand weights for added resistance.  Both workouts can be done separately or together for a total body workout.  As with all the Prevention workouts, there is a participant who demonstrates the modified versions of the routines and Chris's cuing is flawless.One of the things I appreciate about the Prevention workouts are the Smart Ways To Live Well bonus segments.  In What is Cellulite?, a doctor breaks down the two types of cellulite, why we women have more of it, and how we can reduce it. In Break It Down, Chris explains the lower-body moves that one might have a bit of trouble with.  Finally, in Attack Arm Flab, Chris demonstrates four moves designed to firm up those flabby upper arms: the Tricep Overhead Extension; the Tricep Kickback; the Hammer Curl; and the Push-Up.Highly recommended."],["This Prevention dvd is one of my favorites! Chris Freytag is encouraging & friendly & you can tell she really wants you to get the most out of this dvd. It has 6 different intervals of various exercises so that helps to keep things from getting boring. Each interval also has one person doing a basic version of the exercise so that when Chris kicks it up, this exerciser stays at a basic level, especially helpful for those just beginning to exercise or those who have been out of the game for a while.  The strength training program also is very good & the combination of the two makes for a wonderful workout."],["I was hoping for something new and different.  Well,  this is definately the same old exercises that I steer clear from, they overdevelop my quads. I don't see how the strength portion of the DVD gets rid of cellulite.Chris Freytag may be an awesome personal trainer and have a tight and toned body, but if she anticipates making any more choreographed cardio segments she needs to learn how to be with the music.  I just couldn't do the cardio part because it was off the beat.  And, the combos are not easy to follow, the patterns are not logical.  Sorry I have nothing good to say.  I am an aerobics instructor , so I know my subject well."],["The best thing about this DVD is the cardio section. Including warm up and cool down, it is about 45 minutes. I don't know about you, but I'm getting tired of all those workouts that insist on squeezing everything into 30 minutes or less. The cardio is divided into 6 intervals, and the intervals are further broken down into low intensity, high intensity, and a 1 minute \"power burst.\" I do a lot of DVD workouts, and the cardio section in this DVD is demanding and original. There is also a 15 minute toning section that is quite demanding. Overall, this is 1 of the best workout DVD's I've ever tried, and definitely the best Prevention Fitness DVD. Chris Freytag is a doll. She's the kind of trainer you wish you could work out with in person."],["Summer in Qatar brings days with temps on many days 50c+ and going outside is a 'non starter'. So that I can continue working out I order in a supply of workout dvds and this time, despite not knowing anything about her, I ordered a couple of Chris Freytag's....and I'm so glad I did.  The Fight Cellulite Fast dvd is challenging, it gets the heart rate up and even if cellulite isn't your issue it still provides a thorough cardio workout.  After a 40 min cardio section there's a 15 min (approx) weights section that can be done directly after the cardio or done separately if you're short of time.  Also bought Chris Freytag's 'Walking Cardio ShapeUp' which is lots of fun.

Wonderful movie."],["Mika is a beautiful woman inside and out, and does a great job of acting, as usual, in this film.Bless her sweet heart for helping to publicize the Smile Train, which provides free cleft lip and palate surgeries to those in third-world nations who would otherwise be out of luck."],["This is basically a film promoting a non-profit called Doctor's Gift. They go to places (in the story, Shanghai) and donate their expertise as plastic and reconstructive surgeons to fix some major disfigured faces.We have two stories running in parallel of two teenage girls who live a world apart in almost every sense, but share a birthday. There's Katie, a pretty blonde from Malibu, whose father is a psychiatrist and who has boys wrapped around her little finger. And there's Lin, in a small village near Shanghai, who was born with a major birth defect of her upper lip and gums. This is not just a harelip, but a more extreme distortion. She goes around wearing a blue veil heavy enough so no one can see through it, and in fact barely goes out of the house.In Katie's senior year at Malibu High, her school included a requirement for some kind of public service, and Katie's teacher had experience with Doctor's Gift. One of the things they do is accept American students as volunteers, giving them a chance to contribute their time and gain some experience. Katie was apparently struck by the fact that the file her teacher gave her (Lin's) showed they had the same birthday.It's a simple story, really, but a nice one. A rather spoiled young girl learns to care for someone other than herself. And a girl who was afraid to think of herself at all is transformed."],["The touching story of a spoiled girl, Katie, from an upper middle class family who finds out about a school project where a handful of students go to China to help in a hospital program involving some pretty disfigured kids going through surgeries.The pictures that Katie sees upsets her (especially one girl in particular who shares her Birthday) and she decides to go with the group.Throughout the movie, we also see glimpses of the chinese girl's life, which is very sad.She was abandoned as an infant, and a worker found her, and raised her as his own.His wife became outraged by this, and instead of HELPING the orphan girl,she become jealous of the attention the man gives her. He ends up raising her alone.When the 2 girls from different worlds finally meet, it is very touching,and Katie gives the girl, (Li) the courage to go through with the operation.This was just a very nice movie, one without sex and a lot of cussing,and unpleasant characters (except for the stepmom)It was just one of those movies that restore your faith in mankind.Very uplifting, and well acted, too.Also, it was filmed on location in China, so there is a BEAUTIFUL backdrop to a wonderful story!!!!I HIGHLY reccomend it!"],["Yes, it may be a little long in spots but even as a cynical old lady I found the message sincere and moving. Katie is an utterly believeable confused American teen (been to the mall lately?) and it wouldn't make sense for her to become Mother Theresa overnight.

Perfect movie for when you're in the mood for a little uplift."],["Smiles is an uplifting movie. The cast is ok (Oteri has a lot of SNL in her, and gets a little annoying, but she's still a good soul)  The story is sweet and poignent and the setting is exotic.

The trouble with SMILE, the motion picture, is that it stretches this idea into 107 padded minutes, incorporating far more sitcom TV dialog about wealthy families with strident children looking for ways to escape uninspiring parental role models with teenage sex life and outside causes.  It takes so long for this movie to get going that it loses the viewer.The strong elements lie in the concept of the parallel of two girls born on the same day, one to the wealthy Malibu family with everything but concord, an the other left as an unwanted deserted orphan because of a facial deformity, salvaged by a caring worker who raises her as his own.  The stories run parallel through the teen years when the Western girl seeks meaning to life by joining a humanitarian medical group whose efforts are directed toward offering the Eastern girl a chance at a normal appearance.  The comparison of the lives of the two girls and their disparate families is tender and meaningful and that alone is worth the effort to tell this tale.The actors are very good for the most part - Sean Astin in his most mature role to date, Mika Boorem as the Western girl and Yi Ding as the Eastern girl, and Beau Bridges and Luoyong Wang as the apposing fathers, Linda Hamilton as a rather tiresome mother, and some good young actors in supporting parts.  The cinematography in China is very lovely but there is little tie in with the California counterpart.  Jeffrey Kramer directs with less hold on pacing than on commitment to a worthwhile tale begging for brevity.  Grady Harp, October 05"],["It's very rare that U.S. filmmakers get to work freely in Mainland China. This one even was nominated for the Chinese National Film Award. The locations share places not seen by tourists, the performances, both from the notable American and Chinese cast members are great! Families, wherever they're from, want the best for their children and in this case, the cultures are so diverse that one would think otherwise, not the case. Realistic locations, great music from some of the best in the business. Laugh, cry and enjoy!"],["So, I'm reading T. R. Holtzclaw \"Travis H.'s bile-spewing review below and I'm thinking, \"Kevin Dillon's character from 'Platoon' LIVED!!! ... and he just attacked 'Smile' with the butt of a shotgun!!\"While \"Smile\" is no one's idea of great cinema, it's hardly the utter waste Travis felt compelled to warn the planet about.  On the negative side, the pacing of the story, due to some \"Afternoon Special\"-style editing, runs too long in many scenes.  It's this T.V. style of movie making that nearly robs this project of the impact it plainly is striving for.  A by-product of this is that the lead girl is a bit too successful in conveying teen self-centeredness at its most grating (a problem easily managed through some deft use of the remote), where a couple less scenes of this sort of exposition would've made the point while tightening up the movie nicely.  At least one reviewer below thinks Cheri Oteri brings too much SNL - for me, she brought just enough, if only because it raises the tempo of the movie from its lethargic stroll.  She tones down her wilder style, leaving the impression of some inspired improvising, and next to the other people on screen, her character is a splash of technicolor flitting around a field of sepia-tone.  She's just too close to some real humans I rely on for comic relief to be seen as anything but a plus for this flick.For those in the audience learning Chinese, this has more than a smattering of clear Mandarin used to propel certain parts of the story.  That the Chinese father and daughter home-study their way to some fairly impressive english can be seen as either promoting the Asian stereotype of genetically pre-disposed brilliance ... or borderline laughably off the mark.Where the movie succeeds, in particular the DVD rendering with its extras, is in the light it sheds on special projects that've been set up to provide kids around the globe with medical treatment for birth defects.  The final 1/5th of the movie seems to get the pacing and acting right (just in time!) to convey the strong emotional impact this kind of work can have on the patients and caregivers, alike.  As the story concludes and drifts into the final credits, the choice of music is also a particularly effective touch that continues to carry the tone of both melancholy and great relief that are at the heart of the real drama on which the movie is based."],["My first reaction on seeing the cast was to groan inside. Not wishing to prejudice my viwing beforehand I persisted and was pleasantly surprised by the result.Be not mistaken, this is no earth shattering movie which will win artistic awards or even oscars.It is a feelgood, tugging at the heart-strings movie aimed at Western and westernized audiences,It tells the tale of two girls born on the same day an ocean apart who grow up leading very different lives. While for the girl of Malibu life is a breeze with comfort and success without struggle living in the parental home with two parents who fight and squabble but who nevertheless dote on their daughter, the other girl enjoys or endures a different experience. In China a girl is found abandoned with a facial disfigurement. She is discovered by a worker and taken home to be brought up alongside his wife and son. They leave after seven years when the husband resists his wife's demands to send the girl away. He selflessly devotes himself to her upbringing despite the difficulties while she hides herself away lierally in the house and by a veil when outside.The two come together through a community service project which takes Miss Malibu to China. Each learns a little about life on the other side of the tracks and good wins through until they all live happily ever after.Partly a propaganda movie the film plays on the emotions and we can all share in the pain and joy. We wonder what the disfigurement is until it is finally revealed near to the end of the movie. Despite this aspect to the movie it certainly had an impact on my children at home generating many questions about a whole gamut of areas. The scenes are touching and both my fifteen year old and eleven year old certainly got the moral of the story.Good wholesome fun for the family and although it is more than a little bit corny at times and also ham-fisted with obvious parallels it pays it's way.I don't normally recommend movies like this but on this accasion I am happy to do so for children of all ages."],["Saw this previewed on another movie and just had to get it.

It doesn't matter what you see at first; there is far more to people than anyone wants to believe, and their true beauty lies in more than appearances.  Lin was already a beautiful person, and Katie had to go to China to discover her own worth.I cried because so many people think their lives are so crappy around me, but they never had to grow up living like so many of the children this movie exemplifies.  It is not the best movie in the world, but it brings home the valid point that western civilians feel way too sorry for themselves over absolutely nothing, and pretend they never saw things like this.

This a heart-warming film also falls more into the chick flick category, but can still be enjoyed by all.  There are a couple elements that I thought were a little unrealistic, but all in all, it was a believable story and the dressage riding is very impressive.The story begins by introducing us to Annie Garret, a mother, wife, and dressage rider who loves horses, but whose personal life is in a bit of a mess.  Her husband can't keep a stable job and the family (Annie, her husband, and her daughter), are constantly moving from one place to another.  Added to this problem is the fact that Annie is living with unresolved guilt because of her older sister's death, which has strained her relationship with her mother.  As the movie opens, the family is looking for a new start by moving to California where Annie's husband has been hired as the stable manager at a horse farm/ranch (I'm not quite sure which it was).  But the unexpected meets them.  The promised job disappears because the farm has been sold before the family arrives, and upon learning of a new failure, Annie's husband takes the car and his things and leaves her and the daughter (Taylor) to fend for themselves. Annie is further burdened, though comforted, by having brought along her beloved horse who now has no where to stay.  Through sheer pluck and determination, Annie gets a job and decides that she is going to financially make a life for herself and Taylor by competing in a high stakes dressage competition.  Yet, the road to reaching this goal is not simple.  Sickness, horse problems, and emotional healing lie along the path as Annie learns to achieve her dreams while putting her past failures aside.For those interested in watching this film with the family, please note that there are three \"D\" words in it (that is all I counted), but no other profanity that I heard.  Other than those, it is a clean movie appropriate for family viewing, but if you do not want your children exposed to language, be aware that there is some cussing in this movie."],["This is a good family movie.  My children have horses and they love them dearly, much like the lady in the story.

The plot gets a bit sappy in spots, but, if you are a horse lover, you will not care.  There are only a couple of shots or places where the dialog is nonsense for \"those that know.\"  E.g., horse would not be wearing halter in stall; or how can Marsha Mason's character help Julie's with the freestyle if she cannot get her own horse to halfpass.  I loved it!"],["The long Shot is a heart felt movie that will make you believe in miracles."],["I was so tickled to see this wonderful movie in DVD form.

The story is simple, a lady is left by her husband with a child and a horse to support.  With a strong, but understanding, boss she gets back on her feet doing what she does best- riding dressage.  It has a few of the more minor swear words in it.  But other than that, it is perfectly clean.  And I think quite suitable for family viewing.  I also think single mothers and their children will get a lot out of it as it mirrors real life, but at the same time shows how to get out of the quagmire we humans often put ourselves in.

It is pretty well acted and beautifully filmed with lots of horses. They didn't get carried away with things the bad guy did so that it is still palatable for the squeamish. As they say, no horses were hurt during the filming of this movie. The handling of the problems the woman had in early life that led her to the path she wound up on was well handled. The little girl could be more attractive and appealing but I guess she was someone's daughter. She was certainly adequate as an actress. The lead actress could have been better. Sort of a whiney irritating voice but an attractive woman. Why do jodhpurs make all women's hips look the size of Texas. Marsha Mason lifted the movie up to a very nice level.

She had some responsibility in this - but the film just makes her a innocent victim.  Of course you have to ignore that because we're going to make her into Snow White.  The portrait of the man she marries is stereotyped in this movie as a someone who is a COMPLETE loser - but she is the COMPLETE saint & heroine.  It doesn't show in great detail how she made such a poor decision in marriage, brought a child into this terrible situation [surely not her fault again] and her responsibility in all this.  It is a completely unrealistic view of marriage and 2 people [her and her unfaithful husband] - because no one can be as bad as him and no one can be as good as her; real life at close range is just very different.  And the potential sutor that starts to come into the picture at the end . . . . he's just as totally unrealistic and wimpy . . . .  He's a guy that adores her way of thinking, never disagrees with her, is totally in orbit around her life, has all the time & money in the world to just follow her around and thinks she can do no wrong.  The little girl, who wants her original Daddy in the beginning [usually true in real life] also makes a weak attempt at holding on to some sense of true values.  But we're really going to wash this movie out - so the daughter eventually realizes her Daddy a bum too.  But Mommy is going to make it all better . . . .  This poor movie washes out any family love and any redeeming love toward Daddy in the end too - along with our having to swallow 100% empathy for our Mrs Snow White.  Ignore also that Snow White pushes her way into jobs, situations and into people's lives - even the other characters are eventually going to look a her with nothing but stars in their eyes.And we want to call this a family movie???? This just teaches the viewpoint of selfishness - in a woman's sense.  Who wants to sit their family down and show them 2 people that can't grow up and keep their commitments to really being a family - and then call this a \"family movie\"?  She's just as bitter and angry toward him in the end as he was toward her - but she's justified???  This type of current thinking in our culture of \"a flexable family\" with new fathers & mothers coming in and out is beyond me.  I suppose if you throw a horse in we can give up all the human values that should be present????  Maybe Lassie can run across the screen and that will save this story too????  Surely Lassie can make this a family film!Give me a Sarah - Plain and Tall - who advocates commitment and stands by her decisions - and I'll call that a family movie and something worth watching."],["My daughter & I saw this movie when it was on TV & both loved it .

Young Annie's sister is killed in a car accident on an errand Annie was supposed to do, so she feels her mother blames her for her sister's death. Annie feels her mother favored her sister which adds to a growing chasm between mother and daughter. Now grown, Annie, her husband, daughter, and her horse Tolo are on their way to his new job, only to be deserted by him along the way. Annie manages to show up at a stable run by Mary Lou and talks her into hiring her. We see quite a bit of dressage from both Tolo and Mary Lou's horse Red, and things go well until Annie is unable to get Tolo out of his stall and finds out from the vet he is blind in both eyes. The vet recommends having him put down but Annie rises to the challenge and slowly gets him to adjust to his condition. When the bank threatens to repossess Tolo because Annie's husband defaulted on the loan, the only way to keep him is for her to win a musical dressage competition on Red despite an earlier fall leaving her with no feeling in one of her legs. She hurdles that obstacle, but when her husband attacks Red, causing him to be withdrawn, her last resort is to compete on Tolo. With her parents and daughter, and Mary Lou and her daughter watching, she and Tolo win first prize and more than enough money to pay off the loan. Best of all, her mother, who up until now had been showcasing her departed daughter's ribbons, presents Annie with all of her ribbons framed, so mother and daughter can finally heal their relationship. A great movie, though as some pointed out there is a bit of rough language so perhaps parents want to watch the movie before allowing their children to watch.

We feel the it will make a great addition to our library collection."],["The Long Shot (Georg Stanford Brown, 2004)I don't remember what it was the originally caused me to have such high hopes for this movie--it languished on my (admittedly massive; I try to keep it under 400 titles) Netflix Instant Streaming queue for well over a year before I actually got around to watching it--but when I dialed it up tonight, the first thing I noticed was Paul le Mat's name, and the second was that the very first shot in the film was overlaid with the words \"Hallmark Presents.\" I knew at that point that any hopes I had were going to be dashed to the ground. Is it always the case that Hallmark Channel movies are such trite, predictable shit as the ones I've been exposed to? Because this is my seventh or eighth (my wife's grandmother always has the Hallmark Channel on when we're over for holiday dinners), and, well, they're about as fresh and original as Dame Barbara Cartland romance novels.Plot: Annie Garrett (Saw V's Julie Benz), her husband Ross (The Net's John Livingston), and daughter Taylor (Gage Golightly, of the recent Teen Wolf TV series...my, how she's grown up!) move from Denver, Annie's childhood home, to California to seek their fortune. The farm where Ross works goes under, and he exits stage left, leaving his family in the lurch. Annie, desperate for money and a place to board her horse Tolo, ends up living, and then working, at a farm owned by gruff-but-with-a-heart-of-gold owner Mary Lou O'Brian (The Goodbye Girl's Marsha Mason, slumming it before what would seem to have been a semi-retirement in 2005) and soft-hearted assistant Guido (Le Mat, who I just saw in Grave Secrets and was about equally fond of here).  This being a Hallmark Channel movie, you can be guaranteed that things are not going to stop there, though getting into the specifics of most of the problems Annie and Tolo encounter on their road to the local dressage finals (and I'll tell you, it's a loooooooooooong way from Devon) would be spoiler territory.Not that it's not painfully predictable in the sense that you know there are roadblocks (the main one, which turns this from a simple horse story into OMGHALLMARKINSPIRATIONALMOVIE, is cleverly concealed by changing the breed of the horse--this is, it turns out, based in part on a true story; the real-life cognate of Annie Garrett has posted about her experiences as a consultant on the film at IMDB), and I can't begin to imagine it would be a spoiler alert to say that Annie, Tolo, and Taylor soldier on through (I'm reminded of a line from a much better film I watched today, The Adventures of Tintin: \"You hit a wall, you push through it.\") and everything turns out all right in the end. The problem is, the folks who write Hallmark and Lifetime and (fill in the basic cable channel) Original Movies never seem to realize that it's possible for everything to turn out all right and do so in a different way than the viewer is expecting. This was screenwriter David Alexander's first time working with Hallmark, though he had previously penned oh-so-inspirational TV movies like this for CBS; their partnership has continued to this day. Do I need to watch any of David Alexander's other movies to know they're going to be just as plodding and predictable as this one? No, I don't. *"],["Enjoyable movie like the acting and story line.

I decided to invest in a few yoga videos to keep me moving at a good pace and really improve my body's tone and muscle shape.Rodney Yee is a master yogi.

His body is perfectly sculpted and toned, and watching him, I was able to make my body mimic his.At first, the moves were not that difficult, and they did not \"burn\" but as the workout continued, my body began to really feel the positions and open up. At some point, I even began yelling back at Rodney, \"I've got it this time!\" I felt so proud that I was able to easily follow along through most of it, and when I couldn't get it right the first repition, the move was repeated for both sides 3 times until I had it down!This is great for intermediate yogis, even beginners who have a knowledge of the positions!

For those people who need a vigorous workout, and do not like this dvd, I recommend you try it again, it is a burner."],["I bought YOGA BURN and its been in my life ever since. Calming, slow controlled movements that align your body properly and release stress and tension. You'll feel great after a few practices.

Most Importantly, you will feel much more relaxed and hey, maybe even a little happy. Buy this DVD today."],["I have some of Rodney Yee's other videos and I have to agree with everyone else that it is totally different. Most of the poses are repeated 3x which means the stretches actually are pretty beneficial and you advance further with each repetition. The first half contains the only \"burn\" part which is an extended downward dog with modifications; the rest is a nice wind down. I am pregnant and bought this with CRUNCH's pregnancy yoga video, I actually like this a lot better and other than the boat pose am able to do most of the poses just fine, and it's much more interesting and challenging than the pregnancy one.

He takes everything almost painfully slow.  This, however, I find a good thing.  He is not doing anything too terribly difficult, but it becomes a challenge because he is slowing everything down so that you are having to concentrate on making sure you are doing everything the right way.  It is also extremely relaxing, and a good routine to do if you do want to do a routine but at the same time are too tired to really do a more challenging routine.

Pretty good video!"],["This 60 minute routine is a powerful and mindful yoga practice. The poses are all done slowly and with continuous movement then repeated several times. The sheer slowness trains the mind to be `present' so you will definitely feel the burn.YOGA BURN is different then Rodney Yee's other practices and I really enjoyed this workout as I found myself getting into the zone because of its slow, meditative and almost hypnotic quality (the great ambient music helped too) Some of the poses are quite advanced but I think the really challenging part is the length of time the poses are held and the repetition (most sequences are done 2 to 3 times each.)For a change this has been filmed indoors and Rodney looks better than ever as he gives us flawless voice instruction from a raised wooden platform. The audio is available with 2 different options; Full or minimal instruction (which is a great feature)I think complete beginners will need more instruction and modifications than are available here and I did find some of the moves quite advanced. Rodney also claims that this sort of practice will boost your metabolism and I can vouch for that as I was starving halfway through.No props are needed except your yoga mat and I can highly recommend this workout.

Rodney Yee leads a beautifully orchastrated series of yoga moves that are meant to bring you inward and in touch with your body.I disagree with the other reviewer that this is a beginner, easy practice. Moving slow and listening to your body can be a challenge in it's self ;o) You should have some basic knowledge of yoga postures since there is no instruction on the form of the postures.Rodney starts off on the floor with some very slow, repeated movements using your core. He does a very creative version of spinal twist. He moves on to a series of very slow moving sun saluations with warrior and this is a wonderful way to get in touch and improve your practice of faster moving sun salutes. And again, a very creative version of thunderbolt. Then on to the floor for a series of forward bending, backward bending, and leg stretching. Again, very creative moves that I have not seen on any other yoga DVD. He usually repeats each movement 2-3 times. The practice is a little under an hour.This is a wonderful practice by Rodney Yee.

Besides, I was getting tired of zipping through asanas with these other DVD's and wanted to stay in poses longer and even practice a few bandhas, and this DVD really assisted with that. Also, this particular practice does not require props (only if you have them) as other of Yee's does.

My favorite has been Rodney Yee's \"Power Yoga-Total Body Workout\". \"Total Burn\" uses some of the same exercises, but at a slower pace which really does give a good...burn, especially in my abs and triceps. Some of my favorite exercises, like upward bow and warrior three, were not included in this practice, but if all of my favorites were included it would have been 90 minutes long not 60. I was looking for something that would give me a more focused stretch and ab workout and \"Total Burn\" does that. I would still recommend that someone who is interested in practicing Yoga, develop a library of various DVDs. Variety helps to round out your practice and maintain interest. The music is a bit loud, but that is the only thing I don't like about this DVD. Rodney Yee does indeed Rock."],["In Yoga Burn Rodney Yee takes standard yoga poses and slows them down to a fluid and graceful flow. Each move is done three times and then flows into the next position.  Now don't get me wrong, slow and precise does not mean easy; when you are slowing down repetitions where your core (abs) are engaged you are building some mighty strong muscles, and you do feel it.  This dvd was excellent.  I felt like the poses were well chosen for the workout: chair poses, forward bends, bridge, triangle, seated twists, boat pose, bow pose among other others.  I felt very loose and relaxed when I finished this dvd and felt like I had a good practice.  My mind felt calm and my muscles felt loose and well worked.I do yoga a couple times a week along with many types of exercises and would consider myself an intermediate practitioner.  Though the dvd states beginner to advanced, I would recommend watching the dvd all the way through if you are an absolute beginner and don't feel like you have to go as deeply into the poses if you are not quite there with your flexibility.  I started with very elementary dvds for practice at home first so that I had practiced quite a bit before moving on.  I would say this would be perfect for intermediate and above as you are already familiar with the poses and already know how to flow from one pose to the next.The instruction is calming with light instrumental music in the background that is pleasant and never distracting.I enjoy yoga by Bryan Kest, Alan Finger, Sara Ivanhoe and Shiva Rea among others and liked the idea of getting something a little different with my practice.

It's clear from watching him how to do the poses. I watched the DVD first before trying it. The poses looked so easy that I thought I wouldn't get a good workout; however, when I did the exercises, I found I was sweating within 10 minutes. Admittedly some of the poses are difficult for me, but I do my best. I've found that each time the challenging poses are a little easier.  I like that the poses are done slowly; the stretch and burn revitalize me. A side benefit is that my posture is getting better. Maybe it's all the stretching?

I feel it in my abs and afterwards my upper arms feel like they have been really worked out. My chest also feels more open and free than it has in years.

Much of the yoga practiced here in the US is too fast paced with an emphasis on athleticism but this workout was not challenging for me. I would have given it 3.5 stars but that is not an option. This is a good practice if you are feeling tired and stressed, but the claims of added muscle mass and bone density are definitely overstated. This might be a good starting point for people who do not want to do more advanced postures and would like to spend more time on perfecting basic asanas like Warrior I and cobbler's pose.One quibble I have with his productions-- since he uses a voiceover, why can't he mirror his actions so that he provides more accurate instructions?All in all, it is not a bad offering but if you would like a challenge with some meditative balancing postures, try Yoga Zone's Power Yoga.

Instead, you are supposed to move very slowly from pose to pose so you are in constant slow motion.  Once I got the hang of that, I really enjoyed it a lot.  I feel it is a very gentle way to improve core strength.The set and music are pleasing.  Yee is alone on a platform in a room that looks like a giant Zen sandbox (somehow, that does seem to work).I wouldn't recommend this video for a complete beginner, because the instruction is minimal.  For example, he says \"Warrior II\" and that's it, you need to know how to get into Warrior II on your own.  Most of the poses are beginner level poses, though.  I'd say the hardest ones (for me at least) are Bow Pose and Upward Plank Pose.There are actually two audio tracks on this, one with instruction (though it is limited), and one with no instruction, just a statement of the pose name.There is a lot of emphasis on downward dog/plank poses, so if you have wrist issues that could be a problem.

As a 56-year-old woman, I have not yet developed my upper body enough to handle the down dog, plank, cobra sequence through a number of repetitions, but it certainly gives me something to strive for--I also find the stress on my wrists something I need to deal with.  I was more comfortable with the sitting poses, though I certainly can't fold in two like Rodney.  If you are a strong beginner, I would still recommend that you learn the correct form for these poses through some of the other tapes, because doing them wrong at this intensity can be harmful."],["This is a different type of yoga tape.

I use foam mats when I workout to the dvd and this really makes a difference in the comfort for my knees and back."],["I love almost anything Gaiam makes and I love just about everything Rodney Yee.This video requires some strength that I just don't have yet...but I look forward to being able to do the whole video in six months or so.  I will just keep doing a little bit of it at a time to build up my strength."],["Love Rodney Yee, hate this DVD. Unfortunately, the music is SO VERY loud, I could barely hear the talking, and yes, I could just turn the volume all the way up and then I would be able to hear the instructions, but the music is so bad and unpleasant I wanted to turn it OFF, not UP. For that reason, a big disappointment..."],["This is the best Rodney Yee dvd.  My husband is now hooked and I often buy it as gifts for friends after we tell them how much we love it.Takes a few times to master, but worth every minute.  And the time flies by leaving you feeling great and really rejuvenated."],["The title \"Yoga Burn\" is a bit of a misnomer. I probably would have given it five stars otherwise.  While there are some challenging moves in the beginning such a slow chair pose, the remainder was a slow, mindful, and meditative practice.  If you are looking for something like Bryan Kest or Baron Baptiste where you hold the pose for at least five breadths, this is not it.  However, the repetition of slow movements (3xs each) allows for bringing circulation into that area of the body, and you find you are able to get a little deeper each time.  I love watching him as I'm doing the yoga.  It feels like Rodney is just flowing with the movements-a very intuitive practice.  This was a nice spin on the usual vinyasa where sometimes you flow in and out of poses too quickly.  Sometimes a position feels so good you just want to stay there and \"feel the sweetness of it\"--if that is what you are looking for this is the video for you.  This was a nice change of pace and I really enjoyed it.  I will use this after doing weights, or other workouts for a beautiful and mindful stretch."],["This did absolutely nothing but bore me to tears.  It is so slow, not to mention extremely easy to do.  Do not bother with this video if you have done yoga at all....it is very basic."],["It had been a couple of years since I had done yoga and I was trying to work through some residual hip/soas area injuries related to pregnancy. After just a couple of sessions, I was amazed at my increased range of flexibility and how much better my hip/soas areas felt. Within a week, I was feeling stronger as well. I feel wonderful after doing the DVD workout and enjoy the flow of Rodney Yee's choreography. My only complaint is that I wish the poses were held longer so that I could have more time to allow my body to get deeper into the poses. At times, I feel rushed. Since I had been away from yoga for so long, I started out with 'Rodney Yee's Yoga for Beginner's' DVD. The Beginner's Yoga was nice in the sense that I was able to refresh my memory for proper alignment on poses, but I was left wanting more after completing the short workout(s)."],["The title &#34;Yoga Burn&#34; is deceiving.  I thought this would be a challenging workout by the title, but it's nothing more then a slow moving yoga where he repeats the postures a few times.  There is no &#34;burn&#34; what so ever, and I am not an experienced yogie."],["Yoga Burn is everything you would think when you see the cover.  It burns and it feels great when you're done!  I can really feel it working my body and Rodney Yee has such a calming voice and presence he makes you want to continue.  I love yoga and have gotten many of Rodney Yee's DVD's and recommend them all.  His routines never get boring and he mixes things up enough to get your heart pumping and then cool you down.  It's a great workout.Thanks"],["Don't let the title fool you!  This is not a \"fat burning yoga\" DVD.  Its a mindful, well-constructed practice.  The best part is that even though you are moving constantly - and sweating - it is paced so that you have enough time to breathe through each pose and reach your own correct form.Every sequence consists of related poses - for example, seated easy to cobbler to modified boat - repeated three times, sometimes with an intensification.  The only pose that repeats from sequence to sequence is downward dog, which is ideal.  There is a nice mix of prone, seated, standing, and twisting poses.  The first time I did it, my back felt like someone had rolled the kinks individually out of each muscle.Rodney Yee produces DVDs without distracting props or music and his instruction is always clear and concise.  He knows the limits of practicing from a recording. He's not trying to overcome them by spouting cliches or tortured metaphors, just trusting that the practice itself, done well, will help you clear your mind and center yourself.  I haven't felt the need to switch to the music-only audio, but its nice to know I can once it's memorized.If you are an absolute beginner, start with something more basic and come back to it."],["While this instruction was not difficult to complete, I was pleased to feel it in several areas the following day. As always, Rodney Yee ever pleasant and soothing in this practice. Poses are held longer than usual and repeated several times for an overall effect.Some people might not feel this as a challenge. Moving slow and listening to your body can be a challenge in it's self. You should have some basic knowledge of yoga postures since there is no instruction on the form of the postures.Rodney starts off on the floor with some very slow, repeated movements using your core. He does a very creative version of spinal twist. He moves on to a series of very slow moving sun saluations with warrior and this is a wonderful way to get in touch and improve your practice of faster moving sun salutes. And again, a very creative version of thunderbolt. Then on to the floor for a series of forward bending, backward bending, and leg stretching. Again, very creative moves that I have not seen on any other yoga DVD.\"Yoga Burn\" is a wonderful alternate workout for those experienced in yoga, or those just wanting a way to relax after a stressful day. This DVD will help balance the rest your Yoga collection.Namaste!"],["I picked up this DVD at Target for 15 bucks and I really like it. All my other Yoga DVDs feature women as instructors, and I was nervous that a man instructor would focus too much on strength moves. I don't know how that applies to Rodney's other DVDs, but in this one he only does easy beginner poses.The key is, he does each pose in a set of three. You do the moves slowly, which took me awhile to actually DO, as I am used to each pose at the speed I have been already doing them.I did not feel much of a 'burn', but i did feel a definite heat in my core during the hour-long workout. I honestly felt GREAT - my blood was nice and warm and I felt very strong. So maybe this is the kind of burn that is referred to, instead of the typical aerobics burn of using a muscle group until fatigue. This DVD is not like that at all, even though it's what I was expecting.Some of his sequences were very fluid and creative - I liked his warrior vinyasa, for example. And some of his forward bends really encouraged my body to loosen to a far greater extent than I had done previously. I found the repetition of each pose (the three times) to be boring at first. Then I noted that each time I repeated the pose I was able to go significantly further into the stretch.I did not find that much strength was needed in the hour, but then, I like downdogs and planks. There are also some updogs halfway through that got exhilarating/tiring, but one can always replace them with cobras if needed.Rodney has a very nice yoga instructional voice. Soothing. He does not talk too much - the instruction is just enough, as long as you know what each pose is named (he uses the English terms). Rodney is also enjoyable to look at.The setting is quite nice - set in a yoga studio - some kind of very cool Zen one. There are rice screens behind him; he is on a bamboo floor platform, and the platform is set above a Zen rock garden. The beige sand is raked around the rocks like one would expect. Very peaceful to look at, with some Zen-like, low music in the background that does not distract.I found the DVD a bit sparse in options. No matrix or sections to choose from - you just start the program and an hour later you are done. So if you don't have that much time, you'd have to do only a part of this DVD from the beginning, or fast forward to another section and go from there.There is an intro by Rodney that i still need to watch. There is a choice of playing the hour with less instruction - ie, just voice prompts. The full-on instructional option is not for novices, however. Rodney assumes you have some experience and can follow along by going into downdog, boat, warrior one and two, etc, without having to be told anything about them. He provides no postural tips or even breathing assistance. I think at one point he reminds us to breathe and relax our faces, and that's all we get. I would have liked more direction about when to breathe in and out, myself.So this DVD would be good for experienced beginners and for intermediates looking for an easy burn. Anyone expecting any arm balances, pigeons or wheel poses won't find them here. I assume for that we'd have to buy his Intermediate Yoga DVD. I actually probably will at some point!"],["Rodney Yee is a pleasure to watch. The work out is tough though! I've got to work into it slowly."],["The concept sounded interesting and challenging. The thought of completing a vinyasa in very slow, continuous movements sounded quite a feat! I'm not a beginner in yoga, but not advanced either - by no means. I have to say that my favorite aspect in yoga is its physical challenge. This DVD focuses more on the spiritual/relaxation part. It's an hourly practice of power yoga, which requires that you go through the movements very slowly and mindfully, and repeats the poses about three times each. The premise is that you work harder and concentrate deeper on the experience, the breathing and the pose.I must say that it didn't do it for me. Maybe because I'm used to Ashtanga yoga, which is more intense and structured, I found that the poses Yee put together for this practice were unchallenging as a whole. Some very easy seated poses are repeated again and again, and I must admit it got tedious. I didn't even break out a sweat, and although I hadn't done any yoga for months I didn't feel the slightest soreness the next day. That's not what happened when I did Yee's Total Body Power Yoga practice - in contrary, I found it challenging and invigorating. So, my advice would be if you're looking for a power yoga practice that's not so physically challenging; that takes you slowly over the movements; that will focus on your mental concentration, then you will enjoy this practice. However, if you want something more intense then go for the 'Total Body' DVD."],["I am usually a big fan of Rodney Yee.  I bought this to challenge my workout a bit and to work on strengthening my abs/core.  What I found is that Rodney starts to loose the mind/body/breath connection.  I have gone to yoga classes with much better thought out moves.  Sometimes he moves so fast in and out of asanas that I loose my inner focus.The routine feels rushed. It also feels WESTERNIZED.  Like Rodney is trying get on the LA Burn power craze... which is NOT YOGA!!!  That is just my opinion.  I rarely use this video after buying it... as again I just feel rushed. There are many other Rodney Yee videos I prefer.Also my belief is one does not have to pump the body hard or stand on your head in a neck stand to get benefits from yoga.  Yes head/neck stands etc. might be applicable to some.. but this routine seems to move from beginning to advanced postures.. In otherwords it feels like the routine is all over the place.Sorry not my fav.J. R. is the author of:Lady Liberty: The Definitive Julie London Handbook"],["This DVD forces one to slow down.  When I first started, I was doing the moves faster than Mr. Yee and waiting impatiently for him to catch up to me.  Then I finally gave in and went along with his advice to slow down.  I was amazed at how my body responded-a perfect workout to slow the mind and body.  I feel so peaceful at the end I want to go to bed!  Plus, Mr. Yee's voice is relaxing to listen to and the new agey music is very calming."],["I find this Rodney Yee DVD simply wonderful, as my title says.I'm not into power yoga nor am I much of an athlete.  As someone who's been doing yoga for about one year, I find this a good workout: not too intense and not too easy.  Just right (for me).Other reviewers say the moves are VERY slow, but I don't think they are.  In total contrast to the other reviewers, I wish it was even slower.  But this is how I like to do yoga.  I feel I should stress that: this is how I like to do yoga.The reason I wrote that sentence twice is because I think reviews of \"workouts\" are HIGHLY subjective.  Many people write how good this or that DVD is without mentioning that it's to their taste.I have purchased more than a few yoga and dance DVDs that I simply do not like because of things like the music or the instructors' voice.I like this DVD on all levels.  I like the gentle new-age music.  I like the sound of Rodney Yee's voice.  I like that it doesn't feel or sound like a \"workout\". What it looks like, I haven't really noticed, and I really dont care about that, because I usually just listen.I really like that this DVD is quiet and fairly slow without being too easy.  It's hard to find that mix."],["I own a number of Yee's DVDs, but was a bit disappointed in this one. It follows his same usual postures, but at a much slower pace. This was nice for a change, but not what I was expecting. It was not as challenging as I had hoped."],["I disagree with the reviewers who state that this workout is easy. The slowness and repetition of each pose 3 times makes this a challenging workout in my opinion. Frankly, I have difficulty imagining how anyone could find it easy.Here are some points which I would like to highlight:- The moves/poses are all done in slow motion. This not only adds challenge, but it also helps in learning the moves and building \"mindfulness.\"- The workout is about 1 hour, so I tend to use it more on weekends or days off. During the week I tend to use Rodney Yee's Power Yoga for Strength or Flexibility (which are shorter and, in my opinion, easier than Yoga Burn).- It is a combination of strength building and stretching, followed by a 5-to-10 minute meditation at the end.- Most of the poses are repeated 3 times, but with variation, increasing in difficulty.Since I started practicing yoga about 6 months ago, my lower back pain has decreased dramatically. I have an office job, so I must sit at a desk for long periods of time during the week; this DVD is a welcome counterbalance to that. I only wish that I had discovered yoga a little sooner!March 2009 update: I just did this video tonight for the umpteenth time and still find it very rewarding. It is one of the few exercise videos that both provides a great workout and leaves me with a sense of calm. I like to do this one when I get home from work."],["This new Rodney Yee yoga DVD gets me warmed up and I stay that way! This routine may not be as quick as others and doesnt use many highly challenging poses(cobra & boat puts the back to work though!)but I get to experience the poses fully and completely. I really get time to stretch and strengthen, not just burn calories by moving quickly from one pose to the next. This DVD has a place in my collection!"],["This DVD is fantastic.  It took me almost two weeks of practice to be able to complete the entire workout.  At first I was worried that it might be too difficult.  Now I run through the entire workout several times a week.  I can't believe the difference in my muscle tone.  I love it."],["i've done this one about 8 times and am just getting the progression of moves and rhythm of the saltuations down.  It's very different to go into poses so slowly and to slowly explore the impact of a repeated movement on a part of your body.It's tough, took several attempts before I got all the way through.  Definitely meditative, but to be that way, he would need to be a little more sparse with the instruction."],["I disagree with one of the spot lighted responses about the dvd being too easy and just for beginners. I have been doing yoga for 3 years (mainly Rodney Yee's Yoga for the Athlete - with is slow and steady) I tend not to like Power Yoga, but find myself to be fit and athletic.I found all the Downward Dogs in the beginning with repeated leg lifts, leg twists, and knee to chin exercises to be VERY DIFFICULT! I didn't find myself warmed up enough to do those (maybe I am just a whimp!!)  I even got a terrible migraine and a dizzy spell from doing those (which has never happened before doing yoga). It takes a lot of upper body strength and endurance that may be difficult for the beginner.  Those exercises may have fit in better in the middle of the workout, as one is more warmed up. It just felt too forced in the beginning. The rest of the DVD was easier, so the flow was a bit off.  Still was an okay workout with a good stretch.I tend not to use Yoga Burn very much because of the dreaded downward dog beginning."],["The first few times I did this video, I was focusing on the poses and didn't really feel the burn. It all felt too slow-mo, compared to Bryan Kest's power yoga videos. But at about the sixth time I did the video, I \"slowed down\" even more, and realised that the slower you do the poses, the more difficult they become, and the more burn there is. Which made it quite strange cos now, my practises on this video feel alot more difficult than the first few times I did it. It could be all in the mind. But as Yee proposes in this video, it is all about \"mindfulness\". So for those who don't seem to feel any \"burn\", how about trying it this way - do it even more slowly, be in the present and focus fully on what you're doing, and on the sensations, and maybe you'll start feeling it - which I did, in my arms and thighs!"],["I really enjoyed this dvd.  it is an intense work out but it is really a great production and enjoyable to follow.  Rodney Yee is a wonderful instructor."],["I usually do a faster flow style Yoga.  This turns all that upside down and all around.  You move consciously and very slowly into each pose then you repeat the flow a few times.  I found the workout to be decently challenging and I consider myself an intermediately fit person.The real benefit of this workout is in deliberately slowing yourself down while using your muscles in a new way.  It makes you pay attention to form, you feel each of your muscles as you move in and out of the poses.  It's also a good mental exercise on being present, in the moment, and paying attention to your body.  This workout is the opposite of hectic.  The opposite of the bounce around jump around like a jack-in-the box type workouts.  Although you will definitely feel the burn!!"],["I definitely loved his Power Yoga, this dvd was just ok.

At no time did this \"yoga burn\".  In fact I have added it to my DVD shelf of yoga DVD's for days when I need a gentle practice or am not feeling up to par.  I would classify this DVD as beginner and not let the title mislead you into thinking this DVD is physically challenging."],["I am really enjoying this DVD and the workout.

As a relatively new person to yoga I found that I was able to do the poses, the a couple of them were a little tougher for me.  But paying attention to the poses and listening to the instruction is putting it all together for me so it is definately worthwhile.And you do feel that you have accomplished something even without moving quickly.Highly recommended."],["I just finished this Rodney Yee \"Yoga Burn\" DVD for the first time.

I haven't practiced yoga in a year or so because life just got very busy. However, I decided to start practicing again today and went back to this dvd. After four years, this is still one of my favorite yoga dvds. The poses are simple enough for beginners, but still a good work out for intermediate students. Since it is a slow pace you have to hold your poses longer, which means build more control over your muscles.The poses you need to know are simple beginner's poses: downward dog, warrior poses, boat pose, chair pose, forward bend, staff, single leg staff, etc.Right now, my muscles are complete jello, and I have a feeling they will just be sore tomorrow. SO instead I will do a combination of 1 session of AM Yoga for your week (also Rodney Yee) and the Beginner's Yoga (also by Rodney Yee) tomorrow and go back to Yoga Burn the day after. My goal is to work my way back up to Power Yoga (also by Rodney Yee) which is a lot harder workout."],["I really love this dvd.  I've been doing Rodney's Power Yoga Total Body workout for quite a while now (I love this as well).  But, I felt like I needed to mix it up a bit so I got Yoga Burn.  I am hooked.

I am 48.My body feels wonderful after this workout.Great job Rodney!!"],["I love this workout! It is very intense not physically as much as mentally, so you really have to pay attention, which I find more relaxing. I always feel great after finishing. It is long, so make sure you give yourself plenty of time to do it and relax."],["I've been practicing classical ashtanga yoga for 2 years now, and recently purchased this DVD as an at-home alternative to class.  While very, very different from what I'm used to, I did find it to be okay.  I have utmost respect for Rodney Yee as a yogi.  He does a beautiful job instructing and his voice is calm and soothing, which aids in staying focused and moving slowly, which is what this DVD is all about.  He also doesn't yammer on about a lot of spiritual and new-agey stuff like other instructors do, which makes it great for people who do yoga purely for physical purposes (I'll note that I am NOT one of those people and am very spiritual with my practice, but I certainly understand not wanting to listen to someone's spiritual views while you're trying to get a workout!)I also purchased Rodney Yee's \"Power Yoga: Total Body Workout.\"  I will most definitely use that one more often.  Both are not as challenging as I'd like, but after the first time through the DVDs I noticed that there are poses that Rodney did in the practice that have more challenging variations that I am familiar with, so next time through I'll alter my practice a bit.  So for more experienced yogis, while this DVD may be a little dull, push yourself and pay attention and tweak this practice to make it a little more challenging.  You can't always rely on a DVD to give you every single variation on every single pose to fit your specific wants.  So do a little homework, watch the DVD through w/o practicing and see if you can find some alternatives.Also, I do want to mention that for people who do asana as a part of their yogic spirituality, this DVD's slow pace is GREAT for stilling your mind and keeping focus!One qualm I do have with this practice is: \"WHERE IS THE BREATH????\"  I'm used to having my postures follow my breathing, but in this unique practice wouldn't work that way.  I tried to figure out some way of breathing throughout this practice, but halfway through I just stopped thinking about breathing and just did the postures.As far as the difficulty level goes, no- I do not suggest this for very new beginners.  If you are new to yoga but in pretty good shape, go for this DVD, or if you've been practicing for a few months and understand basic alignment and such, go for it.  Also, keep into consideration what TYPE of yoga you practice before buying a DVD.  A beginners Power Yoga DVD might be quite challenging for someone who's been practicing gentle Hatha or Iyengar yoga for any amount of time.  It's all in what you're used to.  (Believe me- I found that out after my first Bikram class!)  If you've been practicing power, ashtanga, Bikram, jivamukti, or any sort of vinyasa yoga for a year or more, don't bother with this DVD if you're looking for something to simulate your everyday class."],["I was given this dvd as a gift after asking for a yoga dvd and mat set. I've done yoga at the gym before, yet would still consider myself a beginner. I also suffer from Fibromyalgia. I found this dvd to be too advanced, and was left unable to do the next pose only 10 minutes into it (he was folding in half!!!). There is no explanation of the poses, and I had to watch and then rewind to see what I was supposed to do next. I gave the dvd 3 stars, because I have enough understanding to know that if I was more advanced, this might be a great dvd. I do appreciate how Yee goes into and out of each pose in repetition, creating a total workout. But, all in all, this dvd is meant for someone who has done yoga for some time and has knowledge of the poses - and is flexible enough to get into them."],["Hi all!It took about one and a half weeks for the dvd to reach me, but it is in GREAT condition. I popped it in the dvd player thinking, \"I do Yoga, this will be a piece of cake.\" WRONG!!! It is so INTENSE!!! I made it through half of the dvd and I had to quit. This is a great dvd though. It targets muscles I didn't even know I had. I recommend it to everyone. If you have back issues, this will help. It's way better than paying 100.00 three times a week to get your back adjusted.In short...give it a try.

I love this dvd and I STILL practice to it often. It just moves so smoothly from pose to pose and his voice is so amazing! What I like the most, is even though you're moving at such a slow pace, the time goes by so quickly because the transistions are flawless! Rodney discribes the movements of the body in such a way that anyone can understand. He is a wonderful teacher, however, very modest! You can tell he has a big heart and it just makes you want to follow along! I recommend Rodney Yees books and dvds to ALL of my students. However, this dvd is by far one of his best! TAMARA'S YOGA FUSION"],["This is where all of Rodney Yee's videos are lacking: thorough explanation of the correct form. This video has the option to modify the video to be played with more explanation or with simple leading through the poses. This is of interest to those who want less coaching in their videos. I am a novice to the Yoga fad, but so far I am very happy with what I have experienced the more I practice. I have only had the opportunity to use videos, so I have much to learn regarding the correct way to perform a pose or movement. Rodney Yee, in another Gaiam video, was my first taste of Power Yoga and I found it very refreshing and invigorating but at only 20 minutes, something of a warmup. As I progressed to other videos I found that greater instruction and explanation of the poses helped me progress quicker and allowed for more effective Yoga sessions even with Rodney's videos.Additionally even compared to the 20 minute video, I feel there isn't sufficient enough \"heat\" or warmth created in the muscles before the stretching. This video's real benefit is in improving flexibility. It is a calm and meditative session in stretching. Unfortunately it is difficult to get the most of this because of the lack of the muscle warmth to start.I recommend this for experienced yogis who want to improve flexibility."],["I have tried other Yoga DVD's and I always go back to Rodney Yee.  If you like the Power Yoga from Rodney Yee, you will like this one as well."],["I bought this video on the recommendation of two of my yoga students.  The video was good.  It was slower than most which is nice to see.  I did find that once you got to the final pose you were already moving out of it.  I will practice with this video in the future but probably save it for a day that I am feeling a little slower.Rodney does have a nice soothing way of explaining the poses and of course he demonstrates beautifully.  If you do get bored with this video just sit back and enjoy the sight of Rodney Yee."],["I was reading through the many reviews of this DVD and realized that I've actually owned Yoga Burn for about 2 years and never used it! I think what happened was I bought Yoga Burn at the same time I bought Yee's Advanced Yoga DVDRodney Yee - Advanced Yoga.  It took me all of 2 minutes of previewing the Advanced DVD to stop it and put it away.  I put the Burn DVD on the shelf with it, assuming that it would be equally difficult; they'd been collecting dust together ever since!But reading the other reviews recently made me realize that I can probably do the Burn DVD, so I pulled it out and tried it (the Advanced Yoga DVD is still collecting dust, and will probably be for many years to come). Now that I've tried the Burn DVD, I understand what the debate is about, and I think I can help bring some clarity for those who are wondering if they should purchase it.1. For those who are afraid it will be too difficult: this DVD CAN be done by beginner-level folks!! The entire DVD is comprised of basic poses. The difficulty only comes from having to hold them for a longer period of time. As you practice, you will gain strength, flexibility, and the agility you will need for transitioning from pose to pose. If it's too difficult at first, just do as much as you can and you will eventually do the whole thing with purpose, integrity, and grace.2. For those who are afraid it will be too easy: ok, I may not be the MOST fit person in the world.  But I'm fit enough to do Rodney Yee'sPower Yoga - Total Body Workoutor Shiva Rea's Fire Practice without collapsing! If this DVD is practiced with purpose and you INTENTIONALLY use the muscles that the poses are designed to target, you will not be able to help but feel a burn.  Now, exactly how MUCH burn will depend on your fitness level, but there's no way you won't generate some heat.3. For those who are afraid there won't be enough instruction: Yee explains during the introduction that the main focus of this DVD is in the slow, purposeful TRANSITIONING from one pose to the next.  I take this to mean that people who purchase this video (even beginner-level folks) should already be somewhat familiar with basic poses as well as with how to breathe.If you are not familiar with basic poses and breathing, then you should also purchase Yoga for Beginners (Patricia Walden's DVD is an exceptional source of basic instructionYoga for Beginners,Yoga Journal - Yoga Practice for Flexibility).  But don't let that stop you from purchasing Yoga Burn.  Once you're confident with the poses and breathing, you can pop in the Burn video when you're in the mood for a good, extremely low-impact workout that will improve your strength, flexibility, and mindfulness.4. For the folks who are afraid it will be boring: I'm not a big Dr. Phil fan these days, but I agree with him when he says that \"bored people are usually BORING people.\"  If you're getting too used to ANY video that you practice, just make a choice to spice it up!  Creative folks who are very familiar with a DVD and its poses will naturally begin to alter the poses to make them more advanced or more interesting.Of course, I can't speak for anyone else, but I myself did not find this one boring.  Actually it was a welcome (albeit temporary) break from my ongoing (and ever-intensifying) love affair with Shiva ReaShiva Rea: Daily Energy - Vinyasa Flow Yoga,Shiva Rea: Yogini,Yoga Shakti,Shiva Rea - Fluid Power - Vinyasa Flow Yoga.Anyway, to sum it all up...for those who are wondering if they should buy Yoga Burn: Just Do It! Hope this helps : )"],["This is exactly what I was looking for when I shopped for a yoga workout.  I needed a workout that focused more on flexibility and the steps to getting in and out of a pose.  This one has worked really well for me.  And despite it feeling fairly easy while doing it, I am definitely sore afterwards, especially in my legs."],["One of my first yoga instructors was Rodney Yee; I am a ten-year yoga veteran and I have always enjoyed his programs but he does have a tendency to get too poetic at times.  It's hard to relax into a forward bend when he tells me to \"feel like my toes are buds about to open\"!  Yoga Burn, on the other hand, has little \"chatter\", and sticks to basic instructions which let you focus on what you're doing.The poses are familiar, without being boring.  It's beginner accessible, but challenging enough for an intermediate practitioner. It's also a great workout: by moving slowly and consciously through the poses, you can't rely on momentum to push you through.  There's less of a tendency to hold the breath, too.The setting is serene without making me jealous--no Hawaian tropical settings with crashing waves in the background, or mountain scenery to distract.  The music is relaxing without making me want a nap.Taking everything into consideration, this has become one of my favorite home practice programs."],["This DVD is for beginners and will not provide a challenging practice for anyone who has been working with Power Yoga: Total Body or Energy Balance Yoga, two of Rodney Yee's other recent DVDs.  I was disappointed.  If you are looking for a practice that emphasizes basic postures, however, you will like this DVD.  Rodney Yee is a great teacher; \"Yoga Burn\" was probably not the best title for this particular practice, since it implies that the postures and pace are advanced. They aren't."],["With all the break neck fast yoga dvds with the focus on athletic conditioning flooding the market for past five years it is good to go back to this old school meditative yoga practice.  Not Yin but not cardio power yoga either - but just right.  Perfect for morning to waken up or night to unwind.  Rodney may be too Eastern or new age for some but if his calling the floor \"mother earth\" bothers you then you probably will not like this routine anyway. If I recall I think Camel might be the only pose that beginner might have trouble with other than fact that you are on your hands a lot holding poses so wrist issues might be something for beginners too.  As for intermediate  or advanced yogis, the beauty of yoga is you never out grow it and instead just go deeper in the pose and the long hold counts work beautifully for deepening into the moves for greater gains in flexibility. Folks if you are not feeling the burn IT IS YOU NOT MR. YEE'S ROUTINE that is the issue and  you need to go deeper into the pose and push your flexibility (gently) up against the wall of your ability and then you should feel the burn just like you increase your weights to heavier amount when 10-12 repetitions are to easy.  Finally this dvd is Perfect for people who want the benefits of a Yin program but prefer a more moving practice than the Yin and Gentle programs offer."],["This is an amazing yoga video which DOES make me feel the burn. Slow, sloooow excercises . . . very, very effective. I consider myself a beginner and yet found the instructions clear and easy to follow. I'd heard that Rodney Yee was amazing and I have to agree. I love my new yoga video!"],["This guy really works you. If you can make it through the entire hour, you have done well. He is extremely limber. Doing the yoga routine you will sweat and also feel relaxed at the finish.

I was very excited by the thought of slow and coordinated movements to strengthen my body. I feel this DVD does achieve that. In the first segments, you get through these really tough downward facing-dog exercises that really made me sweat and feel the burn. The emphasis on the breathing is very helpful and I was able to focus on that rather than my body struggling through. :o) The flow and gradual movement throughout this DVD is phenomenal and made this DVD a worthy purchase.The only complaint I have about this DVD is that in the first part, say about 20-30 minutes, you can really feel the burn and I was sweating through it. Then the rest of the DVD kind of just fizzles out with the exercises. Rodney Yee goes through some seated floor bends that just really didn't do it for me. On a side note though, I did see a video that recommended using wrist weights when you progress for this DVD. I haven't tried that avenue yet, but I think that will help ease my qualms about the last part of this DVD. Overall great DVD and would recommend to anyone just starting yoga. I don't think that someone in the advanced stage of their level in yoga would receive much benefit with this DVD. The poses are in the beginner to intermediate level of yoga in my opinion and I not sure if it would keep a higher level interested.The \"slow\" element to this DVD is what makes this DVD amazing and it still has kept me coming back for more! Thank you Rodney Yee for being so innovated!"],["He does a great job facilitating the yoga, but it's way too slow for me. I do think it's good for beginners and people who have a lot of patience."],["Fantastic! Easy enough for intermediate yoga students but challenging enough for advanced! Relaxing, challenging, perfect! I feel so relaxed despite sweating through this dvd. Wish he included modifications though."],["I have only been practicing yoga for about six months, so I am a relative newbie.  Plus, I am cursed with the tightest hamstrings in the Western hemisphere.  And so it was with some trepidation that I popped in Rodney Yee's \"Yoga Burn\" DVD - something about the title jangled a bit.Fortunately, this hour-long workout DVD is flat-out solid.  Like all the Rodney Yee productions, the workout is polished and precise.  Yee narrates his workout in voice-over while he silently goes through the poses.  The stage has an attractive temple quality, and while there is some music in the soundtrack it never rises above the level of mild background noise.  And Yee never gets new-agey or overly-spiritual like other yogis.The workout is flat-out tremendous.  Yee puts you through a full-body workout that focuses on repetition and control.  Prepare to move slowly from pose to pose - this slow pace is more pronounced early, but it is a recurring theme throughout the video.  By focusing on holding positions and controlling movement, \"Yoga Burn\" earns its name.The workout starts out slowly with some lower-body stretches (staff pose, cobbler's pose, etc.), gradually moves to some strengthening positions (lots of downward dog transitioning to leg lifts, baby cobras, lunges, etc.), moves to some extensive hamstring and lower-back work, and finishes with some bridge poses and general cool-down.  Yee keeps things moving, and while you repeat most poses three times, he has a couple of one-off poses that prevent monotony from setting in over the course of the hour.All in all, this is an excellent foundation yoga workout for your week.  Highly, highly recommended."],["Great DVD. Some parts of the workout are challenging, and I like that. I've never had a lot of upper body strength, so this DVD is very good for building it. Also, I have very tight, inflexible muscles, so this workout is perfect for just starting out in yoga. I really enjoy the routine and asanas and feel great afterward. I like it so much that I go through it twice in a row each day I do it. I find that I can perform the stretches and asanas better the 2nd time around. The poses are basic, as others have stated, but if you are a beginner or have issues with inflexibility, lower back pain, shoulder and neck pain, etc. and are looking for a way to begin healing yourself, this DVD is terrific for that. I can already see the results in my legs and upper body, and I've done it only twice (actually, 4 times because I do the routine 2 times in a row for each workout). I also practice Bikram yoga, and I find this DVD to be a good compliment to Bikram. Before using the Yoga Burn DVD, I was very shaky with some Bikram asanas and didn't have a lot of strength or flexibility. After going through this routine 4 times, I'm much stronger, more flexible, and have better balance to perfomr the Bikram asanas. I can already see the difference!"],["this dvd is great! it will make you sweat for sure. all his dvds are great if your into yoga!"],["Rodney is a wonderful instructor! I would recommend it to all, but for 1st timers you may want to get a more general beginner DVD to acquaint yourself with basic poses."],["Rodney Yee is my favorite Yoga instrutor via DVD.  Yoga Burn is not as fast paced as his other Power Yoga DVDs but it is a good session for when you don't want the faster pace of the other Yoga DVDs he has.  This has new sequences and is as challenging as you want to make it.  This is a good buy."],["This is a beautiful, mindful, and potentially powerful yoga practice. It is true that there are no big surprise poses in this sequence--all are well-known, fairly basic level poses. The main audio option contains some instruction, but mostly about moving into and out of the poses; there is not much about alignment within the pose. Complete beginners may need more instruction and modifications than available here. The other audio option omits instruction at all, containing only prompts for moving from one pose to another.  The basic poses, simple instruction, and deemphasis on speed makes this dvd a good place for advanced beginners who have some knowledge of the poses to deepen their understanding of them, and for anyone, irrespective of level, to work on the mindful awareness aspect of their yoga practice.The intensity in this dvd comes, not from speed or difficulty of poses, but from deep, slow, conscious repetition of fundamental asanas, with the time to build awareness of movement into, within, and out of them. Yoga is not meant to be a purely physical activity. The awareness aspect of yoga is rightfully considered advanced practice, and the familiar poses presented here allow the mind to take precedence. The point is not merely physical endurance (though, if done right, this sequence will also challenge the body in that way). The purpose is at least twofold: physically, to develop long and lean muscle through slow repetition of simple postures, and mentally, to use the simplicity of the poses as a platform for developing presence and awareness with each pose. Yoga is, after all, about the mind-body connection, and this practice aims at allowing the time and space for working on this crucial element. For those ready to move their yoga practice beyond the physical dimension while still developing the body, this is a lovely practice dvd.The asanas are presented in small cycles of three poses or so with about three repetitions each, so it is hard to present an exact sequence, but here is a list of poses, roughly as they appear in the practice: Staff, Flying Crossed Legged Pose, Cobbler, Half Boat, Boat, Simple Crossed Leg Twist, Cat, Down Dog, Plank, Cobra, Single-legged Down Dog, Triangle, Warrior 2, Standing Forward Bend, Chair, Standing Side Stretch, Warrior 1 and 2, Low Lunge with backbend, Low lunge with hands in reverse prayer, Bow, Cobbler with forward bend, Head to Knee forward bend, Wide Angle forward bend series, Seated Forward Bend, Back Stretch, Reclined Bent Knee Twist, Bridge, Reclined Leg Stretch, Reclined Crossed Leg to Chest, Corpse."],["This video has taken my moment-by-moment awareness of my body to a new level.  I've been using Mr. Yee's Power Yoga videos for a couple of months now, and I am usually aware only of the parts of my body that hurt during each pose, or I'm mentally with my kids, or at work, or on household issues, etc.My first few tries with this video seemed long and boring, until today.  Because of the slow pace of the work-out, I started to notice the sensations throughout all of my body, not just the parts that ached.  My mind emptied of anything else, and patiently started to experience the sensation of being fully inside my own skin.  This was a new experience.  I was very surprised when the tape was over-- the time flew by.This tape does not substitute for the more active Power Yoga workouts, but it teaches an essential mindfulness without which I realize that I will not have full control over my weight.  I tend to eat more in response to my emotions than in response to my body.  The awareness of the body emphasized in this tape, is essential to changing that habit.Thank you, Mr. Yee."],["I know this video received some negative feedback and so I was reluctant to purchase it. I'm a yoga instructor and I found Rodney's sequencing to be very original as well as some of the poses. Those who gave this negative feedback might be looking for a more active session. I like yoga both ways and this video is great for building strength and going within. I'm very happy with my purchase."],["I gave this dvd 4 stars because Rodney's presentation, music, and instruction always deserve recognition, but this class was just too easy for anyone at an intermediate level and beyond. I was led to believe this was for all levels, but it is really a beginner's class. I have at least three of his dvds, Intermediate Yoga, Power Yoga, Yoga for Strength, and I am very impressed with his teaching style. This one disappointed me only because I saw it as a further challenge and it was not.Susan Mathews"],["While Rodney is very impressive in this video, I am a first time yoga user and found I could not keep up with him or even try to do the things he was doing with his body.  I would think you would have had to be doing this for quite sometime to be able to have the strength and balance that he has in this video.  This will be going on the shelf and probably never be used again."],["Rodney Yee's Yoga Burn is tai chi meets yoga. While I can see why it would be too easy for more experienced yoga devotees, it's the perfect starter yoga program. In my case it's the perfect mix of stretching, relaxation, and toning. I've been recovering from back and neck injuries from a car accident, and although I didn't sustain serious injury, I have required time to heal. I did have to modify several of the moves, and had to stop and start, but I felt such a HUGE sense of accomplishment. I feel like I can regain what I lost-- this DVD is what I needed to get started; it gives me hope. The best part was the relaxation technique is at the end of the workout. This is a DVD for people who are beginning yoga or starting a diet and exercise regime and can't tolerate (or don't like) high impact aerobics. I believe this DVD would also be a wonderful alternate workout for those experienced in yoga, or those just wanting a way to relax after a stressful day. Thank you Rodney for providing the less initiated with a way to begin our yoga experience!"],["This is a wonderful yoga dvd for all levels. I think it is difficult to find a yoga dvd that would work for everyone, but this may be it. It doesn't focus on the spiritual/cleansing side of yoga (e.g. no talk of letting go of negative energy or connecting to your inner self, chanting etc.) nor does it focus on only the physical benefits. Whether you look to yoga as a healing practice for the mind and soul or strictly as way to keep flexible and fit, this practice would appeal to you, as it allows for a natural, meditative calmness while providing some deep stretches.The poses are fairly basic, though he does not offer detailed instruction on correct form. Therefore, if you're completely, completely new to yoga you may want to start elsewhere. However, I think so long as you have some understanding of body positioning and breath this dvd could work for you. Even though the poses are fairly basic, they offer a good stretch, and are not SO basic that they are boring for the advanced practitioner. I have done many, many yoga dvds that were too basic to hold my interest or to feel worthwhile, and this is not one of them.Rodney Yee's instruction is very clear. Usually when I'm doing an exercise dvd for the first time I have to constantly look up to the screen to see what's going on. Very shortly into the exercise I found myself following along to his cuing and barely needing to look at the screen at all. This also made it easier to get into the yoga flow and make the process more relaxing and meditative.My one, tiny gripe is that there's a small part where the video shot does not match with what is being said. It lasts about 5 seconds and then the image on the screen matches what he is doing again. His instruction moves on to a new exercise while the image repeats the previous movement. The video image moves back to what he is talking about while the new move is still being set up so it doesn't disrupt much. And after you realize this once you just end up ignoring it when you do the exercise again. Still, it's unfortunate to have this happen in a dvd that otherwise is superb.(As a side note, I got this as part of a Rodney Yee Power Yoga Collection which includes this plus 2 additional 60 min. yoga workouts of Rodney Yee's on one dvd (Power Yoga Total Body and Yoga Conditioning for Athletes). It costs only a dollar or two more than any of the workout dvds individually and they're all fantastic workouts. GREAT value!)"],["I did this one this morning, and I love it!  It's an hour and really is quite a bit different from Rodney's usual stuff...it's not that the poses are held any longer than usual, but they're executed really slowly (though not TOO slowly, at least for me, lol) and repeated 2-3x.It's hard to describe, but it almost feels like a dance, the way he puts it all together...he's soooo graceful anyway, and this really showcases that fact.  I was able to get into wide-legged forward bend much deeper than I usually am able, and I think it's the way he sequences this pose with others...i.e., he twists (slowly, of course) to the right, holds the pose, drops down to the left with right arm extended overhead, turns into left one-legged forward bend, then comes through into wide-legged forward bend (hope I explained this well enough! lol). It's all done so gracefully it makes me want to be just as graceful.Some of it felt pretty challenging...he does a very slow 10-count-up, 10-count-down cobra pose 3x that I really felt. He also does \"baby cobra\" pushing into downward dog (again, very slowly) with knees bent, gradually extending the knees into full downward dog. This one really felt good to me.Also, there's an audio option to turn off all talking except for his announcing each pose as he goes into it...I didn't use it, but it's there for anyone who'd be interested in such a thing.I usually do from 30 minutes to an hour of some kind of yoga a day, usually following my cardio or weights, or whatever I'm doing that day, and I found this to be at a moderate level for me. I really love the way it's all put together and the way it flows at a nice slow pace, yet still feels challenging enough in all the right places...can you tell I really like this one?"],["I have been doing Yoga at home for about 9 years and I have a lot of Rodney Yee's videos and this is the best by far!!

Very rejuvenating."],["Sobepeace 8/21/06 wrote a great review & the poses he names are all Rodney does. There aren't a lot of poses in this 50 min practice w/a 4 minute relaxation mediation due to the fact he moves slow in/out & during each pose & there is repetition for every pose. He moves about 1/4-1/2 speed the whole time & each pose is done 2-4x each either again & again or in a sequence. Normally I hate repetition, but with Rodney's good energy/awareness, I was able to do it, I would also do a more advance version of what he was doing or else instead of in/out as he does, I would hold the pose the whole time. At first I started to FFW, because I was anxious to do something else besides workout before it got too late, but with Rodney, I didn't want to. The music is very slow/minimal which I usually don't like, but it fits with the slow pace & once I got my racing mind to relax with the repetitive down dog, single leg down dog, knee to nose, then w/addition of a lunge repetition & then warrior series, that tired me out a bit. The only thing I'd wish is that instead of doing any poses more then 2x, he'd add more poses. I do enjoy the pace, but I think it would have been better served with that. Since I have good body awareness, I was able to do my own stretches or additions sometimes when he did repetitions that I felt compelled to do that moment, which I'm sure he would be glad that people would do. I have to admit, I felt intense soreness for two days after doing this. Rodey's body awareness really inspires you to push yourself as well & you're never bored.The production quality from GAIAM is great as usual, Rodney voice overs as always, you can choose the minimal instruction w/pose name or choose him only saying the pose names alone. Considering that lack of detailed instruction, this is not for yoga newbies, but intermediate beginners or advanced beginners & beyond. Those more advanced can use it as a light day or for slower, more forced body conscious practice.There are TWO trailers on youtube under \"Gaiam Yoga Burn\" submitted by GAIMSEARCH which is the same video they use on their site gaiam com"],["I often hear of yoga studios offering a \"slow flow\" yoga class, but I haven't been able to find any \"slow flow\" DVDs.

It gives clear, concise instruction, teaching you Yoga-speak, without taking forever to explain the poses.The moves flow, the overall tone of the program is meditative, and if you are a beginner, this is a good way to start toning your body and increasing your strength and flexibility.However, for someone who has been practicing Yoga for at least a year, you will want to find something much more challenging.  I was disappointed that my body did not even warm up - I didn't \"feel the burn\", and spent the work out as cold as if I were sitting on a couch doing absolutely nothing.I find the setting a tad bit sparse - it could use a little softening up, but overall the lighting and mood are excellent.Yee's narration is flawless.Beginners - go for it.  Intermediate - look for something more challenging."],["I recently bought this yoga DVD and have quickly become a huge fan of Rodney Yee. I have been taking yoga classes casually for the past 5 years but this was my first dvd purchase. While Yoga Burn does not necessarily make you sweat this is a real workout if you concentrate and wonderful for posture and increasing flexibility. You feel the workout in your legs, arms and abdomen for the next few days. Instructions are easy to follow if you are familiar with basic yoga poses. The only thing problem is he doesn't focus on breathing so you need to remind yourself or be very conscious of breathing through the poses.

In this made for TV movie, Ann-Margret plays Tula, an aging woman, who may be losing her eyesight...and her home.  Eight years a widow, Tula is reluctant to visit an eye specialist for surgery that might prevent her blindness.  She lives reclusively, and doesn't have room in her heart for anyone, not even the doctor who has his own special interest in her.  Her late husband's nephew and niece are conspiring to have Tula put in a nursing home so they can buy her property and turn it into a swank resort.  Tula's only visitor of late has been a young social worker who is doing an evaluation to determine her aptitude in living by herself.  Into her life comes a handsome young drifter and his precocious little daughter.  Tula takes them in as a handyman and offers them her guest house to live in.  This new influence in her life brings about a change in Tula, and this is where the movie's dramatic core rises.Ms. Margret is wonderful in this role, underplaying Tula beautifully, going from a rather dowdy old maid to a fine looking mature woman who fights for her home and for her new friends.  Gary Sandy is very good as the doctor who wants her to share life with him; Matthew Settle and Shanelle Woodley are fine as the fly by night dad and his fearful little girl; Hunter Tylo and Sean O'Bryan ooze smarmy greed as the vulture like relatives.A PLACE CALLED HOME is entertaining family fare and is an uplifting look at love and the human spirit."],["I bought this DVD for the sole purpose of seeing Hunter Tylo. I had hoped that this movie was filmed before she had all that massive cosmetic surgery, for she was a real beauty before all that, but unfortunately not.

William Christie and his orchestra are great, and the singers are really outstanding, especially Antonacci in the title role, and the two countertenors. Rodelinda is becoming very popular these days, and hopefully we will soon see  more new producitons of this opera, but I think this one is set to become a classic. A must see for anyone interested in the glories of Baroque opera, and brillantly performed Handel."],["I have seen my share of dusty, mothballed productions of Handel operas and at this point I look forward to modern productions; it seems Handel, and opera seria in general can work particularly well in highly stylized stagings and this Glyndebourne version, directed by Jean-Marie Villegier, is a feast for the eyes, ears and the brain; there's no powdered wig or corset in sight, and the modern context of whole story is skillfully played up.Set in the \"silent movie\" period, lighted in stark contrasts, with beautifully realized black and white film feel to it, this is a very distinctive looking production; the costumes and make up all add to the visual splendour.Musically, it could not be better; under the direction of William Christie, the playing of Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment is tight, crisp and just about perfect, and the soloists excel both vocally and dramatically.Anna Catrina Antonacci is incredibly intense in the title role- this is not an elegantly poised Handel delivered at an arm's length. Andreas Scholl plays Bertarido; his singing is impeccable, and who knew coolly restrained Scholl had it in him to deliver such a moving performance on stage! All his arias are standouts and he brings the house down with Viva Tiranno in Act III. There's plenty of Senesino's roles left for Scholl to play, and it looks like he's on his way to become a blazing hot star on the opera circuit.As for the rest of the cast: Kurt Streit as Grimaldo, Umberto Chiummo as Garibaldo, Louise Winter as Eduige, Artur Stefanowicz as Unulfo et al, are just as good- there are no weak links here. This is one of Handel's operas where the plot actually makes sense and this is an extraordinary group of performers who can act and sing the hell out of Handel at the same time.The DVD package is very spare- no extras of any kind, but there are subtitles in several languages, and the sound and picture quality are excellent.For any Baroque opera lover, this is a must-have; for everybody else, this is a great piece of musical theatre of the highest caliber, brilliant, often unnerving and extremely moving, and, methinks, highly accessible; this is Handel for the modern age. Five stars and counting- let's just hope there's more where this came from."],["I am not very fluent in English to write an extensive review, but I would like to say this recording is very very good. To People which like Baroque Opera, and specifically Handel's operas, I recommend very much this recording."],["This one is a total success. The update to the 1930's and a slightly fascist regime works so well it's a wonder it wasn't done this way in Handel's time. The women are regally and gorgeously costumed. Beautifully and imaginitively directed. Everyone acts almost as well as they sing, but the singing requires much more of them and they all acquit themselves admirably. It's one difficult aria after another for all concerned and Handel characterizes each character within the music so very well. Delightedly recommended."],["More than many opera seria, Handel's 1725 Italian opera, \"Rodelinda\", provides such a palpable story of jealousy, revenge and undying devotion that it is no wonder the opera itself has been given such widely diverse translations over the years. I was fortunate to experience two wonderful productions of \"Rodelinda\" just this past year. The first was Stephen Wadsworth's elaborate Metropolitan Opera production set on a beautiful 18th-century country estate, starring superstar soprano Ren&eacute;e Fleming in the title role and the extraordinary countertenor David Daniels as her husband Bertarido. The second also starred Daniels but with rising soprano Catherine Naglestad in David Alden's expressionistic film noir adaptation at the San Francisco Opera (first staged by Munich's Bavarian State Opera).The 1998 Glyndebourne Festival production, directed by Jean-Marie Villegier and captured on this DVD, takes yet another creative path by setting the story in the black-and-white world of 1920's silent cinema. Completely different in execution and style, all three versions simply prove how the highly charged drama and soaring music translate easily in almost any period setting. Although Alden's production is more audacious and heavily symbolic, Villegier brings a relatively simplified approach to the storyline and encourages a highly stylized, silent screen type of acting from his cast. For the most part, it works, and the minimalist sets by Nicolas de Lajartre and Pascale Cazales provide an effective counterpoint. Costume designer Patrice Cauchetier, however, sometimes gets carried away with the fussy, anachronistic clothing she provides, which does little to enhance the performances.Fortunately, the stellar cast is strong enough to transcend such stylizations and shortcomings. In the demanding title role that requires a strong enough voice to carry eight significant arias, veteran soprano Anna Caterina Antonacci is a fiery presence who conveys defiance with ease and feels at home with elaborately expressive vocal lines. Truth be told, her vibrato can be off-putting at times, and her regal demeanor works against the emotion of the more vulnerable passages, for example, during her extravagant rendition of the heartbreaking Act III aria, \"Se 'l mio duol non e si forte,\" in which Rodelinda thinks her husband Bertarido is dead. However, Antonacci's passion and professionalism carry the day.As Daniels has proven recently, Bertarido is one of the truly great roles for an accomplished countertenor. Luckily, Andreas Scholl has a beautiful, emotive voice and fluently handles the wide range of singing from the melancholy of \"Dove sei, amato bene?\" to the anger of \"Vivi, tiranno!\" with equal ease. Scholl is at his peak during his poignant Act II arias, \"Con rauco mormorio\" and \"Scacciata dal suo nido\", where his coloratura is particularly impressive. As an actor, however, he is not as charismatic a presence as Daniels (at least back in 1998 when Scholl was starting to emerge on the scene) and consequently tends toward a certain banality for a king who has been not only deposed but left for dead. All is forgiven, however, with the much anticipated duet between Antonacci and Scholl which ends Act II, the magnificent \"le t'abbraccio\", which does not disappoint.The rest of the cast handles their roles with uncommon skill - tenor Kurt Streit as the impatient usurper Grimoaldo, baritone Umberto Chiummo as the dastardly henchman Garibaldo, countertenor Artur Stefanowicz as Bertarido's faithful sidekick Unulfo, and mezzo-soprano Louise Winter as Bertarido's sister Eduige. All sing magnificently in this production, and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment complements the voices perfectly under the seasoned baton of William Christie. The one major drawback is the way the opera is filmed in overly dark shadows, especially at the beginning, and the alternating long and medium shots that seem unnecessarily busy at times. The visual edginess and restlessness tend to distract from the onstage drama when the focus should be on the beauty of the music. Regardless, this is a faithful record of a Handel masterwork wonderfully performed. The superb Baroque music speaks for itself."],["Spellbound for the entire performance.Noting a  renaissance for Handel operatic works  judging by the relatively recent (2011) Met HD performance with Renee Fleming and a number of very recent releases on Blu-ray of various Handel operas, I turned to my trusted preview venue: youtube.comIndeed, after previewing a number of these including the Met's and Bayerische (Roschmann, Chance) performances, I happened on this 1998 Glyndebourne gem.Without an iota of doubt it is a GEM not to be missed.One must admit that tastes are individual. As Prince Orlofsky remarks in Die Fledermaus- \"chacon a son gout\", but clearly some performances 'move your soul' & 'tickle your fancy'  far more than others.First the performers: Antonacci, Scholl, Streit, Chuimmo, Winter, Stefaniwicz  are all wonderful. Great voices, commanding, convincing & expressive acting; perfect for their roles---Cecil B. DeMille couldn't have done better!William Christie and The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment  are perfect for Handelian repertoire; and the tempo, contrary to another reviewer's judgement, is ethereal- especially given the plot elements and sentiments expressed.Jean-Marie Villeger's stylish production - placed in the silent movie era - is magnificent, simple and fitting. No unnecessary extraneous elementsCheck out the aria \" Io T'Aabraccio\"  wiith Antonacci & Scholl on youtube & see if you are not hooked!!!!\"  [...]One quibble: unfortunately, the only DVD disc of this performance currently available in NTSC and Region 1 or 0 for play on U.S. equipment is a KULTUR studio release. As usual Kultur charges premium prices for an inferior product; they seem to have no respect for their customers.Although the picture quality is quite good and the sound is very reasonable ( unusual for Kultur releases judging by the large number I have seen &/previewed and as many other reviewers have also remarked) they are more than cheap here with their flimsy packaging and next to nil accompanying  printed material (in this case: a single page, double sided--on the first side an exact replica of their cover, and on the other a simple  listing of the number of Chapters without any other truly explanatory material----gotta keep their costs down you know, never mind the customer!)How I wish this performance would be remastered by a caring,credible recording company in blu-ray format with uncompressed sound; and, judging from experience, they would surely include proper subtitles ( as in the Met's production), more than adequate informative printed material and likely special features too (if initially available)---and at a very competitive price point!"],["In spite of my personal love for most Glyndebourne productions, this Rodelinda does not really fill my expectations.  Nice scenaries and lavish costums.  However, the major drag here are... the singers (!!!????)... and William Christie conducting a reduced chamber orchestra (The Age of Enligthment)without enough stamina.  It is difficult to believe that this is the same team that staged the brilliant Glyndebourne Giulio Cesare.  Andreas Scholl disapoints me here, he does not match the art of Michael Chance in the same role for the the Bayerische Staatsoper`s version of Rodelinda (also on DVD).  Although his voice is beautiful and spotless (I think he is a great singer and... by the way... a great individual as well) for some reason he lacks of passion and seems unattached to the drama.  Believe me I put the best of my efforts to like his singing but I could not. Who said that barroque operas have to be passionless?  The same opinion goes to Mrs. Antonacci when compared to her Bayerische's counterpart Dorotea Roschman (Sp?).  The sound in the Bayerische version is much better too, denser and at a faster pace fitting to the action on stage.  Sorry but my personal opinion is that this Glyndebourne's Rodelinda is slower and boring compared to the Bayerische's one."],["That is, the best production I can imagine of the best opera by the best of all opera composers. Well, I could back-pedal and equivocate on the last of my superlatives; there's Mozart to be considered, and a few others. But I'd stick to my guns on the first two:Rodelinda is Handel's finest theatrical accomplishment, the opera in which the music and the drama are most affectively integrated and consistently inspired. Part of its success results from a libretto based on a play be the great French dramatist Pierre Corneille, the only libretto of any Handel opera, in my opinion, that isn't marred by extraneous bombast or silliness. Composed for the London stage in 1725, Handel's score for Rodelinda shows a concentration and expressive coherence quite apart from his Italianate florid display pieces written before or after. In fact, Rodelinda comes closer to being \"through composed\" (in the English sense) than any other large scale work by Handel, perhaps by any composer of baroque opera. The integration of singing and orchestra is magnificent, fully as 'intellectual' as any work of JS Bach yet infallibly emotive and stage-worthy. This is an opera which must NOT be smudged by vulgar stage capers or clownish costumery. It has to be all of a piece, a darkly anxious melodrama that ends in relief of tension, a 'happy ending' still tinged with sorrows endured.That's the accomplishment of this production. Every note and every image sustains the mood of passion. There are no cheap tricks or pratfalls. The staging captures the glamour and worldliness of the pre-WW2 black-and-white cinema, yet there's no clash of anachronism of the sort that hampers more than helps many productions of 18th C opera. The photography is totally proficient in realizing the cinematic ambience. Costumes and sets blend with the demeanors of the singing actors, and those actors are superb in gesture, posture, facial expression, all the qualities of Hollywood sophistication. Beautiful, stately Anna Caterina Antonacci is perfect as Rodelinda, a film-maker's dream casting. Kurt Streit, if he were not singing for his supper, would have done well as a rival for Fairbanks or Valentino. Umberto Chiummo, the odious schemer Garibaldo, could easily play Iago in Shakespeare's Othello or the gnarliest mafioso in any Hollywood gangster flick. This is a filmed stage opera that truly works as a visual film!And the music is divine. From the first entrance of conductor William Christie, the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment performs Handel's challenging score flawlessly. WE get to see the players during the overture, as should almost always be the case on opera DVDs, and their confidence in their instruments and pleasure in the music is visible in their faces. This, dear readers, is exactly how baroque music should be performed, on the instruments for which Handel composed and with the tasteful virtuosity Handel presupposed.Antonacci and Streit are matched in vocal artistry especially by countertenor Andreas Scholl in the role of Rodelinda's true husband Bertarido. All through the opera, I anticipated their climactic duet, as they await their fate at the harsh hands of the tyrant Grimoaldo, and my anticipation was rewarded. It's not the showiest duet in Handel's oeuvre, but it's one of the loveliest, and the two lovers sing it exquisitely. Likewise, the arias of Rodelinda are not as flashy as those of Tamerlano or Serse but their affective musical impact accumulates powerfully.I've seen/heard this production, with a different cast, on stage in two cities, and I've watched this DVD three times since I bought it. Is that an adequate testimony to how good I think it is?"],["I'm a bit hypersensitive to hammy operatic acting, and this particular staging used hammy silent movie acting as a deliberate choice, so it took a bit for me to get past it.  In the end though, it was worth it to make the mental shift.  I wish the shift had taken less effort for me, but not being a silver-screen fan, I think that's more my thing than a failure of the staging.  And to be fair, once I did put in my mental clutch and make that shift, it was effort well spent.So ultimately, this DVD was lovely.  Rodelinda/Antonacci's voice wasn't quite as champagne-colored and sparkly as I might have liked in a baroque soprano, but it was really wonderful, and Bertarido was of course fabulous.  (He descends into chest voice for a few notes, and the resonance and precipitous drop in range literally made me gasp.  My 74-year-old mom, who was watching with me and comes from an Italian family that worships 19th century Romantic opera, now thinks Andreas Scholl walks on water.)Unulfo was lovely, Garibaldo was a delightful moustachio-twirling baddie, and Grimoaldo surprised me in that he was able to make the shift from slapworthy bad guy to really a rather sympathetic remorseful ex-villain.  Only Eduige left me rather cold; I find that character more sympathetic than she was made out to be here.  All of the voices were delightful, full and nimble although I could tell that some were perhaps better suited to opera buffa than the earlier stuff.An excellent DVD overall and well worth the price -- and aside, why do so many of these DVDs have no special features?  I enjoy watching \"making of\" features on movie DVDs, sometimes more than the movies themselves.  They need to start putting things like that, interviews and BTS featurettes, on operatic DVDs as well."],["Villegier presents Handels great opera Rodelinda in silent movie terms - characters are made up with white paint and lipstick; the costumes on the women are gorgeous 1920s and the acting is heavily stylized as in an old Gloria Swanson film. And it works!!! the stylized movements and emoting exactly fit Handels very stylized and formal composing. To top it off the singing is superb. Andreas Scholl in his operatic debut is astounding - \"Dove Sei\" is heart rendingly beautiful, the bravura arias are superb and the acting is heartfelt. As a matter of fact all of the singers are thoroughly in the Handel idiom and William Christie leads his great Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment in a very dramatic performance. One of the best operatic DVDs I have ever seen."],["Two very good DVD recordings of Handel's great opera Rodelinda became available in 2005. One of them is from a 1998 performance at the Glyndebourne festival and the other from a 2003 performance at the Bavarian State Opera. I will call them, respectively, British and German, although both are truly international. For example, in the British version both kings are sung by Germans, while the German version features British singers in these major roles. The \"British\" conductor is native American (William Christie),  and his \"German\" counterpart (Ivor Bolton) is British. The staging directors are French and American, respectively.Much has been said by other reviewers about the British version, and I agree with most of these mostly favorable comments, especially in respect to the great art of Anna Caterina Antonacci and Andreas Scholl. I believe, however, that most of these reviewers have not been exposed to the German recording, which seems to be less popular. I have had a chance to experience both versions extensively on a state of the art video and stereo system.I prefer the staging and filming of the British performance and the artistic presentation of some singers, especially Louise Winter and Kurt Streit. The more lyric quality overall of the singing may be attractive to some viewers of the British DVD. In my opinion, both techniques of presentation are acceptable. Subtitles provided in English, German, Italian, French, Spanish and Portuguese help in appreciating the dramatic plot.I do have serious problems with the sound quality of the British rendition: Compared with the warm and vibrant sound of the German version, the sound produced by the British DVD is somewhat flat and muffled. The German but not the British version gives a feeling of being in the presence of a live performance. Apparently the German version was recorded by state of the art equipment and/or techniques.In conclusion, no ideal video recording of Rodelinda is available today. The opera was performed more recently under the baton of William Christie at Glyndebourne and Paris. Judging from the raving reviews of these apparently unrecorded performances on the Internet, I am hopeful that one day I will be able to view a performance of Rodelinda on DVD that will satisfy me completely."],["The singing was superb, but when I bought it I was EXPECTING an epoch scenario instead of a very dark 1920's one.  I would have wanted to know this before I bought it. Thank you. Maria"],["King Bertarido is missing and believed to be dead--a fine monument has been erected in his memory.  Grimoaldo, a villain with scruples, has usurped the throne by promising to marry the king's sister Eduige and then dumping her to pursue the luscious royal widow Rodelinda.  The opera opens with Rodelinda bewailing her fate and spurning Grimoaldo, who is encouraged in his nefarious pursuit by the plotting Garibaldo--the real architect of the king's downfall. The next scene shift to the monument, where a weary Bertarido has returned and pauses to reflect that the loss of his throne is nothing beside the loss of his wife and son. There he encounters his loyal friend Unulfo who gives him the news. The plot proceeds in convolutions thereafter, but Rodelinda remains faithful to her spouse and ultimately he regains both his love and his throne.This production dating from the Glyndebourne Festival of June 1998 is blessed with the conducting services of William Christie.  The title role of the faithful Rodelinda is sung in stellar fashion by Anna Caterina Antonacci, a lovely singer who lights a dark stage with her radiant performance, particularly in the notable aria of Act II.  Although it is hard to top her performance, Andreas Scholl does so as the noble king Bertarido.  The sound of both singers and period orchestra is flawless.The staging is daringly set in the glamorous era of the silent movies and the color palate of the costumes is a mute monochrome of black, white, cream, beige and almost lavender. The sets are soot and sepia tones and the lighting can be downright murky at times.  There's no doubt in my mind that the elegant costumes for the royal ladies Rodelinda and Eduige are a smashing success.  They drip with pearls and ooze glamor and leave nothing to be desired.I hate to say this of this otherwise fabulous production, but the costumes and makeup for the men make for a very austere visual spectacle when only the guys are on stage. Their costumes are either white uniforms or dark coats, the pancake makeup makes everyone look dead and the only touch of color comes from the vivid red lipstick.  I suspect that this idea worked great on a live stage, and less well for the filmed production.  This DVD captures an actual performance.  We enjoy intermissions between acts with the audience as they savor Andreas Scholl's Glyndebourne debut.  His magnetic stage presence lends color to this memorable effort. Pure gold! (Except for the lipstick!)"],["Rodelinda, Regina di Longobardi(1725)by Georg Friedrich H&auml;ndel has some of the most beautiful arias from this outstanding composer. It's delightful to watch and listen to Andreas Scholl as the King Bertarido: his arias Dove sei, amato bene, Scacciata dal suo nido and Vivi tiranno are prooves of the greatness of this excellent countertenor. About the ambiance of the opera it remind us a little the times of the nazis in Germany, perhaps, because of the costumes worn by the singers. Artur Stefanowicz as Unulfo has three moving arias in the opera, but-without doubt- the last one, Un zeffiro spir&oacute; yields a charming sound sui generis. Kurt Streit as Grimoaldo sings one of the most romantic arias that I have heard: Prigionera, l'alma in pena, which he speaks about the sacrifice of the freedom in exchange of a no reciprocal love; in this case the love of the Queen Rodelinda. Anna Caterina Antonacci, in the role of Rodelinda is full of vigour; her aria Morrai, s&iacute;, against the tyrant Garibaldo is diametrically opposed to the tender roles for the haendelian prime donne. Louise Winter as Eduige represents a sensual role. She is veri good in the recitatives, too. Umberto Chiummo as Garibaldo is outstanding; his aria Tirannia gli diede il regno is the best performance of wickedness that I have seen in a opera by H&auml;ndel. I recommend this DVD! It's superb"],["RodelindaUna &oacute;pera excelente, la pueta en escena soberbia, vale la pena ver la adaptaci&oacute;n.School como siempre un Bertadino s&oacute;lido, algunos bacjes son del registro, o del cantante.Anna Caterina Antonacci una Rodelinda maravillosa y Kurt Streit un villano \"de lujo\".Totalmente recomendable"],["Originally released on VHS several years ago, Rodelinda now comes to the DVD. Although the DVD offers little more than the older VHS, it is nevertheless welcome coming, as it does, hot on the heels of the Munich Rodelinda starring Michael Chance and Dorothea Roeschmann. One could argue that the staging is somewhat out of date now, but few could argue the quality of the vocal contributions from each of the soloists. It certainly wins hands down over the Munich performance on Farao.Rodelinda, one of the triumvirate of classic Handelian operas of the mid-1720s, is a classic of psychological action and shows Handel at his best as an interpreter of human drama and emotion. In the hands of William Christie and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, Rodelinda comes alive in a timeless production from Jean-Marie Vill&eacute;gier. A sort of cross between the Prisoner of Zenda and movies of the silent period, this production was atmospheric and moving, though some will rankle at the 'needless' condescensions to humour (Garibaldo's cigarette aria for example, or his leaping up after being shot to take part on stage in the final chorus dispensing champagne to all).What sets this performance apart from others of the past. at both Glyndebourne and Covent Garden, is the singing. Anna Caterina Antonacci was utterly at ease in the anguished part of the distraught queen Rodelinda, mourning the loss of her husband Bertarido (Andreas Scholl, making his stage debut) and fighting off the attentions of the victorious dictator Grimoaldo (Kurt Streit). The supporting characters are more than simply adjuncts - Louise Winter as Eduige, Artur Stefanowicz (Unulfo) and Umberto Chiummo (Garibaldo) play their parts too in making this an outstanding production. Streit plays the part of Grimoaldo as a noble conqueror, guilty over his victory but unable to contain his passion for Rodelinda, vascillating over whether to have Bertarido executed, though capable of nobility at the end when his life is saved by Bertarido. Chiummo as the treacherous henchman Garibaldo displayed admirable coloratura and an almost feline edge to his actions that effectively got across the double-dealing nature of his character.Andreas Scholl made his stage debut in this performance at Glyndebourne. Initially edgy and uncertain, his character grows in stature, and by the end his characterisation is utterly convincing. His entrance in Act one with its famous aria 'Dove sei?' was almost as if time stopped and we were transported back to Handel's time - his voice grave, pure and heartfelt. He coped well with some very difficult passage work in Act 2, but brought the house down in his duet with Antonacci at the end of Act 2 (Io t'abbraccio) and his 'Vivi Tiranno' at the end of act 3. His prison scene in Act 3 is streets ahead of the most recent Rodelinda recording in its dramatic awareness.In all this was a very sucessful production that, by and large, achieved the praise it deserved in the press. Anyone interested in baroque opera will not wish to be without this video, nor will anyone who is a fan of good opera, well sung and well acted. Highly recommended, and worth probably 6 *"],["It is a wonderful performance, much much more impressive then the austere Munich performance on the Farrao Classics DVD. The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment plays brilliantly for William Christie.Anna Caterina Antonacci is a glamorously beautiful woman with a hell of a stage charisma. Andreas Scholl is outstanding and fulfils his status as one of the two greatest countertenors today (the other one is of course David Daniels). His two arias in the beginning of the second act, when he meets his sister Eduige dressed like a blind vagabond is breathtaking!

However, my boys (3 and 8 years old) LOVE IT!  My oldest son has been asking to study martial arts for a while now.

I have 6 & 7 year old girl and boy starting karate this week.  I got this 2 weeks ago and they go over Part 1 most nights.  It's lots of fun for them, but is really teaching them skills they don't know.  At least when the teacher says horse stance they will know what's coming up.  Beyond that it teaches like 3 types of blocks and 3? strikes in Part 1.  Also various stretches and strength training.  This is all just Part 1, and all at a kids learning level.  Part 2 has complicated combos and such.  They aren't doing that before their class starts.  My kids act like it's Just Dance, but more serious.  I love it.  I got them the Century Kid's Kick ComboCentury Kid Kick Comboalso and it's great for practicing their new DVD \"Power Ranger\" skills...:)- Joe"],["Not too much to say. This product is simply great.

For some mysterious reason they felt that the audience appaluse should be blasted out at around 500 decibles, if you watch this DVD with a surround-sound system you had better sit there with your thumb on the speaker mute button or your speakers may just blow out, not to mention the neighbors 6 blocks away will call the cops.

The show included all of the members of the trio throughout the years along with Tommy Smothers as host and Mary Travers (from Peter Paul & Mary) as guest.  It did not have nearly enough Trio music for my tastes and when it was over, I had lost my interest in seeing the modern version of the group.I think true Kingston Trio fans will be disappointed that it does not include the kind of lively performance I saw in the 60s and is missing many of the songs we've known them for.

Paving the way for many singers (Bob Dylan, Joan Baez &amp; Peter, Paul &amp; Mary to name a few) and the Folk Music Revolution!!  Their niche was the folk ballad and thus they were &quot;The Balladeers&quot; recording folk songs from all countries around the world.The Original Trio, Nick Reynolds, Bob Shane &amp; Dave Guard began the groups long and successful carrer in San Francisco at the &quot;Hungry I&quot; night/folk club.  With hits &quot;Tom Dooley&quot; - Grammy Winner - Scotch &amp; Soda, M.T.A., Greenback Dollar and Zombie Jamoree to name a few. In 1961 Dave Guard left the group and was replaced by John Stewart and had hits like - Chilly Winds and many many more. In 1967 after ten years Nick Reynolds left and so did John Stewart.

Present were  the then-current Kingston Trio lineup of Bob Shane, Roger Gambill and George Grove, as well as former Trio members Dave Guard, Nick Reynolds and John Stewart.Each lineup of the Trio performs several numbers.  We get to here several of their signature tunes--&quot;Tom Dooley,&quot; &quot;Scotch and Soda,&quot; &quot;Greenback Dollar,&quot; and &quot;MTA&quot; among them.Mary Travers of Peter, Paul and Mary makes a special appearance and joins the trio for two numbers.  Lindsey Buckingham of Fleetwood Mac, who had just produced Stewart's hit album &quot;Bombs Away Dream Babies,&quot; plays bass on several numbers and joins Stewart for a duet of &quot;Spinning of the World.&quot;  Stewart also does a solo performance of one of his best songs, &quot;You Can't Go Back to Kansas.&quot;Tommy Smothers acts as MC, quite humorously, attempts to join the Trio on &quot;Chilly Winds,&quot;also quite humoursly, and does a short solo turn, less humourously.At the end, all six Trio members team up for several numbers, and the entire cast joins in on the big finale of &quot;MTA.&quot;While the entire performance is enjoyable, the segments with the current Trio are perhaps the most important reason to have this recording.  Since the Shane/Gambill/Grove Trio did virtually no recording, this is perhaps the only document we have of the contributions of Roger Gambill, who died only a few years after this concert.  It is also nice to have a momento of the late Dave Guard.Any Trio fan will want this concert, and the more complete DVD version is the one to own."],["If  you  admire  the  Kingston  Trio,  and  especially  if  you  like  their  early  work  from  the  late  '50's and  '60's,  this  DVD  is  a  must!

He talks of Buddy Holly and the impact Buddy had on his life and the devastation he felt on Buddys death.  This is everything that anyone wants to know of Waylon.

Interviews and commentary from other show business legends like Gregory Peck, George Burns, and Henry Mancini add to the portrait painted of this unparalelled performer---highlighting his singing and acting accomplishments.

One thing that I never knew that touched my heart was that Bobby Darin spent a night sleeping next to the casket of his late friend Bobby Kennedy, vowing that he would not leave the casket until it was buried. Darin was a very compassionate man and should not have died at the age of only 37.Probably the most touching sequence for myself was the \"Beyond the Sea Reprise\" and the scene before the credits where you see various pictures of Bobby throughout the course of his life, all while you hear him singing Beyond the Sea in the back round. The final wave as he is singing \"so long sailing\" touched my heart.

For all of you Bobby Darin fans, and for those who would like to learn more about him, this is an absolutely wonderful DVD to own."],["On the whole, I enjoyed this biography of Bobby Darin (the best and most brilliant entertainer we have ever had), especially the interviews with Dodd Darin, Steve Blauner (Bobby's manager), Connie Francis, Tony Orlando, and others who were close to him. However, I felt that it glossed over or omitted some important aspects of Bobby's life: no mention of his 8 months of semi-seclusion in the Big Sur in 1968, his second wife, Andrea Yeager (and by the way, I was surprised that Sandra Dee wasn't interviewed for this documentary), his NBC series which was only touched upon briefly, and no mention that he was one of only a handful of kids smart enough to gain entrance into the Bronx High School of Science, and that he started out as a drummer playing in the Catskills resorts during the 1950s. We also learn about the family secret, but what wasn't stressed is that Bobby never learned the identity of his biological father, which devastated him as much as learning the truth about his mother did.However, the real gems on this DVD are the numerous musical sequences and Darin footage, many of which I hadn't seen before. I enjoyed the Jimmy Durante skit the best. It would have been nice to include a comedy sketch from Bobby's NBC show, or from his many appearances on Flip Wilson's show, since he had such a natural aptitude for acting and comedy.This is the type of material that Lion's Gate Films should have included on the Beyond the Sea DVD as an extra, so that viewers could see and hear the real Bobby Darin. For those who want to fill in the missing holes, I highly recommend the book \"Dream Lovers: the Magnificent Shattered Lives of Bobby Darin and Sandra Dee\" written with heartfelt emotion by their son, Dodd Darin."],["This is an excellent documentary on Darin and includes much vintage footage of him performing.  Although his records hold up very well, like many other performers Darin had to be seen live to be fully appreciated.  The live footage gets the viewer as close to that as is possible now.  Although author Al Diorio comments on screen, I wondered where Darin biographer Jeff Bleiel was, since he and other Darin biographers could have provided additional perspectives.  This take is clearly sanctioned by the Darin estate, hence the prominent participation of Darin's son, Dodd.

I would have liked the voiceover narrator to be a little more subtle and introspective, instead of using a booming radio announcer-style voice, but this is a quibble.  This DVD offers many little-seen clips of Bobby performing, a handful of interesting interviews, and overall a very good overview of Bobby's entire musical and film career.  And a brief aside for a moment: for those who think that Kevin Spacey didn't look all that much like Bobby Darin in the recent Darin biopic \"Beyond the Sea,\" check out the footage here of Bobby later in his career, during the year-or-two period when he let his sideburns grow, put aside the tuxedos, and sang a lot of folk songs.  It's downright eerie how MUCH alike Darin and Spacey look in those scenes.  In any event, I heartily recommend this DVD to hardcore Bobby Darin fans, as well as casual fans who want to learn a little more about the real person after seeing the Spacey film.

The clips with Judy Garland, the old documentary footage, the old pictures of Bobby in the studio conducting \"Rainin'\" are wonderful. The strength of the program is that it gives you a real impression of what a great performer Bobby really was, especially if you aren't old enough to have seen him live.The performances here prove -- even if there are many that don't want to acknowledge this -- that the comparisons made between Bobby and Frank Sinatra were completely valid. But when you realize that Bobby played several insturments and wrote his own music, in my mind, he rises above Frank.The weaknesses are that it sort of gleans past his personal life and the dull narration by MSNBC personality Keith Olbermann. But I can't say I blame them -- they would have had to go much longer to really delve into Bobby's psyche.I really hope that one day someone decides to do a movie on the actual events in Bobby's life, not the glossed-over flick turned in by Kevin Spacey a few years back.\"Beyond the Song\" is a worthy snapshot of a sensitive, intelligent, devilishly-handsome, versatile performer."],["Great documented life of Bobby Darin!

It is a classical ballet in the strict sense. The highlights for me:1. As an Indian to have an Indian theme, gorgeous Indian consumes and a superb set made it very enjoyable.2. The story is intense. The dancing is correspondingly very passionate and for this the music would have to be very appropriate and it is.3. The technical quality of the dancing is of very high order for dancers as individuals and as a group.4. There are so many special beautiful dances in the DVD: All of Nikya's (played by Isabel Guerrin)dances, the dances in the palace (very notable is the dance by the golden idol, just extraordinary, it was like the God Indra of the Indian Rig Veda come down to earth to dance), and of course last but not the least the Hades.5. The video production: Wow, rarely is it this good. The lighting is perfect, the set and colors are perfect, the quality of the DVD (compression, resolution, etc) are very good. The camera angle is especially good being almost just above floor level and seems to travel with the dancers across the stage. The floor itself is slightly shiny and nicely reflects the dancers giving a salutory effect. A minor complaint is that the recorded volume level is low so the volume level on your amplifier needs to be turned up to get a reasonable output.This will be a classic in your collection. This is one of POB's best."],["In my opinion this is the best Bayad&egrave;re that is available on DVD, and one of the best ballet DVDs ever made: the dancers are fantastic, the costumes and stage design opulent without ever creating the impression that the stage is crowded, and the orchestra (and sound recording) is very good as well. Filming never gets in the way either.Rudolf Nureyev finished his work on this production shortly before he died in 1993, when he was the director of the Paris Opera Ballet. About one year later a performance was filmed with the original cast, the document of which we have here.For the rehearsals Nureyev brought Ninel Kurgapkina to Paris, who had been one of his partners at the Kirov, to help him recreate the style he had known in Russia. He also choreographed additional soli for Solor, because in the original version Solor's part consisted mainly of pantomime and partnering. The ballet ends with the third act (the Kingdom of Shades), whereas at the Royal Ballet Natalia Makarova included a reconstructed fourth act that shows the destruction of the temple.&Eacute;toiles Isabelle Gu&eacute;rin, Elisabeth Platel und Laurent Hilaire are celebrated dancers, and as celebrated is the Parisian Corps de Ballet: the entrance of the 32 shades in the third act is awesome in its homogenity and precision, the effect is hypnotizing. All the dancers were trained at the same school and the way they do their arabesque pench&eacute;e really creates the impression that they are 32 shades of Nikiya."],["I really loved all of this ballet, but I must say that Act III is my favorite when the Shades descend the mountains in perfect synchronization.  Every member of the corps de ballet has perfect timing and body alignment.  They are mirror images of each other, and all thirty-two ballerinas are graceful.  The height and angle of the leg of each girl in the descending arabesques is exactly the same.  It is magnificent!"],["I go with Mr Weber- I thought the dvd version was excellent (reviewed) but the blu-ray is streets ahead and in 16:9 on a large screen plasma what more could you want. Well seeing the live performance the POB took to Australia would have been the answer but this is as close as you can get as an alternative (PCM stereo notwithstanding).Being full screen was a pleasant surprise compared to the restricted format of my dvd version but that may have been due to the foibles of my old tv which died in an earthquake in New Zealand.This is an excellent production and for anyone at all interested in seeing this company at its best is a must buy. Guerin Hilaire Romoli with young dancers in the cast on their way to becoming etoiles- yes thanks!"],["For sheer visual splendor, I doubt that many productions of *any* ballet will surpass this one. Direct your gaze wherever you like, and you'll find imaginative touches of the highest order. The sets are aptly and richly ingenious (watch how lighting and scrims magically transform the main architectural backdrop, for instance). The costumes are memorable. (Some might find the deeply saturated hues a bit much, but we're in the land of fairy tale, so relax and enjoy!)And the dancing? So uniformly superb that it seems pointless to single out individuals. Nevertheless, the corps de ballet itself perhaps deserves special mention for its extraordinary unanimity of gesture and near-perfection of form. All in all, I don't imagine that anyone will ever perform this work better.For me, the single most magical and riveting episode emerges in the final act, with the justly celebrated \"Entrance of the Shades.\" Here, the music (more on that later), the d&eacute;cor, and the dancers unite in a visionary sequence that would justify the existence of this work, even if nothing else did. Petipa's choreography is so simple yet so profound that it puts a lump in my throat: imagine 32 dancers slowly emerging onstage, one by one down a gentle ramp in a twilit grove, replicating the same exquisitely calibrated gestures, gradually filling the stage for several minutes -- all while banishing time to the distant mists. This is a grueling test of endurance and technique, and the Parisian dancers pull it off as close to perfectly as possible, generating the kind of heart-stopping magic-in-the-moment that only live theater can give us. Here, the corps offers us the passport to other realms that we rightly expect of the great story-ballets. This ineffably lovely scene is a portal to a realm of surpassing eloquence. In a word, it is sublime.If you ever wondered what 19th-century ballet music was like before Delibes and Tchaikovsky changed the score, Minkus will school you all too well. For what he serves up is more than two hours of essentially pleasant (though, ironically, increasingly annoying) musical wallpaper (the \"Entrance of the Shades,\" however, shines with special radiance, as mentioned earlier). There is not a single memorable tune here. Even minus dancers, Delibes and Tchaikovsky help you see what's happening onstage. Their music has a sense of long-range, dramatic destination. Its musical delineations have distinct and highly specific character. Minkus offers nothing remotely so stunning as the Mazurka from *Copp&eacute;lia* or the \"Marche et cort&egrave;ge de Bacchus\" from *Sylvia*, nor any number as characterful as even certain transitional passages in *Swan Lake* and *Sleeping Beauty* (let's not even talk about the many high points of all three Tchaikovsky ballets).Minkus is basically marking time, with generic phrases pointing toward generic emotions. There is precious little invention: one figure repeats over and over again with no surprise detours or departures for parts unknown. The music almost seems generated by reference to a book of stock musical phrases chosen randomly according to the required emotional state. Some consider it unfair to judge Minkus against the later symphonic standards of Delibes and Tchaikovsky. But decades before Minkus began writing ballet music, there was the example of Adam's *Giselle*, which has been standard repertoire since its debut in the early 1840s. The music of *Giselle* sticks in the brain, because it connects significantly with what is happening onstage. Minkus, by contrast, was a mildly talented hack. He lacked genius, and *Bayad&egrave;re* reveals this deficiency in spades.Fortunately, this Paris production is sufficiently sumptuous to compensate in part for the weakness of the music (the Orchestre Colonne performs with great panache, which is the only way to go, although here one cannot say that the musicians make the music sound better than it is; nobody can perform such miracles with raw material like this). I, for one, am grateful to have this blu-ray for the stunning production that it *is* and for the first-rate ballet music that it is *not*. It deepens my appreciation for the musical miracle of Tchaikovsky's ballets and for his role in transforming ballet music into a genre of such significance that major composers afterwards felt no shame in giving it a try."],["If there was ever a reason to buy a Blu-Ray DVD player then seek no more.  This is a spectacular visual presentation of a spectacular ballet performance.The sumptuousness of Nureyev's cheorography and the Paris Opera Ballet's sets, costumes and dancing is a feast for the eye and ear as never before.  I also have the older non-BluRay DVD version and always believed the overall performance and presentation to be fabulous; this recording is unimaginably better.One can only hope that there are more such presentations in the BluRay pipeline.BRAVO!"],["Over the last several decades I've witnessed La Bayadere many times. From companies early on as the Ballet Russe de Monti Carlo to Kansas City Ballet ususally as excerpts but occasionally as a full ballet. The music is certainly not impressive but adequate and it does convey a certain exotic atmosphere. It is not something you'd want to hear as a concert peice as you would Tchaikovsky, Prokofiev or Stravinsky or even Delibes. I must admit I'm intrigued by the other worldly oriental atmoshere fake as it may be. So I aquired two recent recording of full length editions by the Royal Ballet London and the Paris Opera Ballet. Both are good productions but from decidedly two different points of view. Both use the rearrangement and reorchestration of John Lanchbery in the edition Mario Bois, Paris. Mr Lanchbery has \"cleansed\" much of the trite material from the score. (If you don't believe me just listen to the CD of old score conducted by Richard Bonynge.)The three principals of the Royal are Altynai Asylmuratova, Irek Mukhamedov and Darcey Bussell. The three of the Paris are Isabelle Guerin, Laurent Hilaire and Elizabeth Platel. As far as I'm concerned all are stellar. Each is a master of the character they are playing and what is more important is that they become that character. I have played the DVDs over and over. When I think this one is better then I play the other version and it's a draw. As conductor, John Lanchbery certainly gives a great reading to his score with the Royal Orchestra, but so does Michel Queval with the Orchestre Colonne.The productions are quite different. For the Royal performance the choreographer Natalia Makarova has given us a more intimate story telling. This is about the sweet innocent Nikiya who is betrayed by the inconstant Solor. She is tricked by the nasty princess Gamzatti and killed by a hidden snake. In the last act this little love story is concluded dramaticaly by the gods who destroy the temple. The end. However the Nureyev choreography makes this a grand expanding universal dream that transcends the little human story and becomes the apothiosis of great art. All of this expanded choreography of the first acts is leading to the \"white ballet\" of the Kingdom of the Shades. I've never seen a better corps perform. Here we have the transformation of a simple story to the breathtaking beauty of the 32 corps member in superb performance. We are already in heaven; no need for the last act."],["Nuryev has gone all out in this production! The lead dancer is amazingly turned-out - great technique.  Male lead has good feet.  Corps...Wow! Paris Opera Ballet dancers are understated compare to American Ballet Theatre. They have a passion that is a little veiled, but after a few viewings you see that it is just as strong and present - just in a different way, a good way.  It is true ballet. Your money will be well spent on this DVD! It is worth every cent!"],["Others have established that this DVD is a winner. But I didn't see anyone mention the \"Dancer's Dream\" documentary on the making of this ballet. It's precious-- especially for those like me who have never had ballet training. The interviews and rehearsals significantly increase one's enjoyment of the ballet itself.A couple of reviewers, in comparing the Paris performance with the Royal Ballet performance, noted that Irek Mukhamedov seemed uninspired as Solor in London. My theory: he requires a manic role like Ivan the Terrible, Spartacus, or Mayerling to be at his best. Solor may be a \"warrior,\" but he is a not-too-constant lover, not a fighter."],["The dance and orchestra are excellent, however I have to take two star off due to the facts that:1. The audio is PCM stereo only, no Dolby or DTS surround. Although I have to admit even with the inferior surround, the music is very strong and beautiful.2. The video appears to be rather dark and blurry, more like DVD quality as opposed to Blu-ray."],["The DVD and the ballet was excelllent,as well as the music . The dancers were superb and the staging and costumes were as expected of the Paris Opera ballet company."],["This video shows the Paris Opera Ballet at their best, It is the 3 act version which I prefer over the 4 act version,The widescreening and good camerawork make it a masterpiece, Look how you can see the concentration on the dancers faces inthe entrance of the shades !"],["Who can not love La Bayad&egrave;re? Simply wonderful... Just a classic. Imperdible. Great performances of POB stars. Highly recommends. My 6 year old daughter loved it too."],["I liked video very much. This ballet is very beautiful, but with these new costumes it's even better. Isabel Guerin is perfect in this role."],["The Paris Opera Corps is the best,I just keep asking myself if they are human, they are like clones.After 5 Bayaredes, this is still the best choice, even if Isabelle Guerin is a little cold faced, (after all, french dancers are not passionate, aren't they?) or perhaps because perfection is cold.The coreography from Nureyev is beautiful,very dinamic, the sets and costumes are sumptuous, stunning Etoiles and soloist,Elizabeth Platel is the perfect balance technique and artistry.This is the glory of BALLET"],["Como es de esperarse de una compa&ntilde;&iacute;a tan prestigiosa, que tuvo la fortuna de contar con la colaboraci&oacute;n del Gran Rudolf Nureyev,y que esta vez nos ofrece una magn&iacute;fica realizaci&oacute;n ballet&iacute;stica plena de virtuosismo y color. que nos transporta a vivir las emoci&oacute;nes del profundo romantisismo que recrea el libreto ,y que con una espectacular coreograf&iacute;a El Ballet de la Opera de Paris y sus grandes bailarines nos regalan.

The DVD performance, the photography, the scenery, the costumes, the interpretation by the dancers of the Paris Opera was equally exceptional in quality.  Excellent! Love this ballet, above all Act III, Scene 2 - The Kingdom of the Shades  - unique, magnificent."],["This production by Nureyev is splendid! it is probably the best production of this ballet you will ever own! In it we are previlaged to witness two of the greatest stars of the world of ballet. Miss Elisabeth Platel in the role of Gamzatti and Miss Isabelle Guerin in the role of Nikia. Unfortunately they have both since retired from the Paris Opera, all the more reason to buy this dvd and cherish it! Miss Platel is the ultimate Gamzatti but than she is a superb ballerina of taste and refinment rarely seen. Her portrayel of Gamzatti is so elegant as befitting the daughter of a prince on the eve of her bethothal to Solor, danced by the very masculine Laurent Hilaire who was perfectly suited for the role of the warrier, that you almost forget her evil intentions towards Nykia and identify with her longing for this match to take place. She is after all inlove with Solor and will stop at nothing to secure her own happiness. Miss Platel is Dazzling! Her Port de bras is of rare quality and unmatched by anyone so far. Her upper body moves with such musicality that one is almost able to hear the music through it.Miss Guerin is a ballerina of rare authenticity and technical prowess. She sparkles! Her entrance in the third act kingdom of the shades is marked by a pose on stage with one arm lifted and her eyes gazing towards her fingertips. This is a moment of greatness it summerises for me the essence of ballet. She is mesmerising by force of her presence without having to blink an eye! Miss Guerin need but whisper whilst other have to shout.Mr. Hilaire is a captivating warrier. Masculine to the point of being sexy. This is well suited to the oriental theme of this ballet. His leaps are powerful and his presence forceful. His partnering both of miss Platel and of Miss Guerin is commendable.The corps de ballet is \"de grand rigueur\" seldom Have I seen such perfect execution of the third act's kingdom of the shades.The tutus in the paris opera are of perfect diameter and show off the lines of the ballerinas to the fullest. One could not expect any less from the french. Chapeau!"],["The good: well performed with high video and audio quality. Nice costumes. Laurent Hilaire is excellent and a pleasure to watch.The bad: Minkus is at best a second rate composer.  This is a long boring ballet."],["I agree the production is gorgeous.  But...The endless flaws in the amateur videography are egregious, and I'm shocked that no previous reviewer noticed these.  The angles are terrible ranging from a low angle center \"master shot\" camera position and a very high angle, and distant center camera position of the entire stage that is akin to having bought the worst seat in the house in the back of the highest balcony.  The side angles are somewhat better.  But, the editing follows no rhyme or reason the director just cuts from camera to camera for hell of it.  Too many of the cuts are not motivated.The closer center camera position with its low angle gives a marvelous look up Gazmatti's tutu, making her look bigger than she should.  The Golden Idol ends his variation with a double tour, shot from the aforementioned worst-seat-in-the-house-nosebleed-section of the balcony. I wanted to see him dance -- not see how big the Paris Opera stage is.  He looks like a Golden Ant.  Cutaways to close-ups of corps girls' feet toward the end of soloists' variations in the Kingdom of the Shades are not \"artistic\" -- they are wretched.  We want to see the soloists, not the corps girls' feet.  Or, at least, I did. Cutaways to Gazmatti's facial reactions while she's seated in Act II during a variation by Nikiya is inexcusable.  Again, I want to see Nikiya  dancing, not how fabulous Gazmatti is acting.  And this is by no means a complete catalog of the bad videography.The costumes and the sets are glorious.  The dancing is, by and large, very good, though the technique for everyone but Nikiya is merely very good which is not enough anymore.  Unfortunately, in this day and age, technique needs to match artistry, sets and costumes.  Only Nikiya's technique is really impressive.  Solor's jumps are great and his ballon is very impressive, but the day that a triple pirouette was adequate for a premier danseur is about twenty years out of date.But all these choreographic and technical dancing points are minor complaints and I could accept the dancing, the ballet, and the production quite easily if it hadn't been edited with pinking shears by a chimpanzee.  It is the videography that is awful, awful, awful, and most infuriating to watch.  If you don't know about good ballet videography, then my comments will be lost on you.  But you need to compare this version with anything that American Ballet Theatre or \"Dance in America\" has done in the last fifteen years.  They have learned how to video ballet."],["The whole setup is a feast for the eye. Wealth of color, nice customs and beautiful dancing all add to this extravagant production. Alas, the picture is lousy, full of graininess and loss of details. This is noticed especially on human faces and skin and less on the dresses. Lot of dark scenes add to this problem. I guess that the recording was not in high resolution and the DVD would probably be of the same quality (possibly better) than the blu-ray. No wonder that both versions cost the same."],["La Bayadere is best known for the last act called &#34;The Kingdom of the Shades&#34; or Solor's dream. With music by L. Minkus and Choreography by M. Patipa it is simply breathtaking. The Corps de Ballet is as good as it gets and the dancing of Laurent Hilaire, as Solor, is perfection of technique and acting. The Paris Opera Ballet is the oldest extant company in the world and their entirepresentation, as staged by R. Nureyev, is beautifully done throughout- especially the camera work.I do not hesitate to recommend this DVD to anyone who loves 'Ballet'."],["La Bayadere is the backbone of any decent Ballet company and this performance is of the greatest artistic merit any company could ever wish for. This is the last Ballet staged and choreographed before Rudolf Nureyev's sad death three months later.The Paris Opera Ballet has without a doubt one of the greatest corp de ballet of any company in the world including The Kirov. In Act three, Scene two \"The Kingdom of the Shades\" the corp is so beautifully controlled and of a oneness that it is almost impossible to believe that there are 32 dancers coming onto the stage. The setting in a jungle at night has a soft blue/silver moonlight effect so right for this scene, it is almost ethereal and surreal as one would expect Solor to experience in his opium induced stupor. I have never been mad on Act 1,Scene 1 but it does give you the story which is to follow and has wonderful costumes and sets.In Act 2 \"The Betrothal of Gamzatti and Solor\" the corp again shows what a corp should be, although all the theme danceing in this scene are very good my favourite must be the Indian Dance, I have watched this thrilling dance over and over again and can't get enough the sheer enegy of the dancers.The principal dancers, Isabelle Guerin, Laurent Hilaire and Elizabeth Platel are the glorious icing on top of this beautiful cake of a Ballet especially Laurent Hilare who's leaps and twists are out of this world. They all dance beautifully together and this gives this ballet the 5 star is so richly deserves.The one small criticism I have is the orchestra, the stunning music by Ludwig Minkus is often spoiled by the percussion section just being a little to loud and bangy. Other than that wonderful costumes, sets and the superb dancing of the entire cast is the reason all ballet lovers and those just starting off should own the fabulous DVD."],["This Ballet is rarely referred to.  Minkus, ignored by most commercial 'Classical' radio stations, is worthy of more recognition.  It is a prilliant performance with outstanding cast.  Nureyev choreography, what more can you want? and in HDA great addition to anyones musical entertainment, a must have."],["I wasn't a big fan of ballet but this is an excellent blu-ray of a live performance. I have always been happy with Kultur other releases back to Zarzuela on VHS with Placido Domingo so I knew this one is probably good too. I was really happy with my purchase of this because of the high quality video and sound. I find myself watching this performance over and over again. The only drawback is that I think it is in LPCM 2.0. Even with that limitation I still think this worth every penny."],["I now have two copies of this ballet, this copy by the Paris Opera Ballet and the other by the Kirov Ballet......Minkus - La Bayadere / Kirov Theatre....... Which is best? They are both so good that for the common man, there is very little difference. The POB version was filmed in HI-DEF which gives a very good picture quality, although the DVD is not HI-DEF. (PS, This version is now available in BluRay......Minkus: La Bayadere [Blu-ray]).... Color, lighting, sets are superb in both productions. Run time on this copy is 135 minutes, and the Kirov version is 130 minutes. The extra time on the POB version may have been the bonus segment on Nureyev.There was one little blurb in the Kirov version during the closing of the entrance of the Shades segment, where the ballerina who had just completed 38 beautiful Arabesque movements (she was the first to enter) nearly fell when her knee buckled slightly. A couple of others lost their balance too. That sort of thing does not upset me much, but just shows that they are human. Which one of us never makes a mistake? I loved the Kirov corps even with the minor boo-boo.There was no such blurb in the POB version, as their Shades appeared to be perfect. Their formations were magnificent, however they did use a marked stage to help with their alignment. One reviewer commented on the smiles on the faces of the three soloists, so if a smile on the face of a Shade is going to rankle you, better not buy this one. It did not bother me at all. In fact after reading his complaint, it made me love them even more. Some folks are way yonder too critical in their reviews, and I try to make it a point to remind you that you should NOT believe everything you read in these reviews.I do wish there was a better ending for La Bayadere, because it seems to be unfinished. After all, there has been a murder committed, and to end the ballet with the Shades Scene seems to say that it's OK to kill Nikia.Someone says there is a fourth act showing the destruction of the temple during the wedding of Solor and Gamzatti, by the ghost of Nikia. It would be interesting to hear the music for the fourth act."],["Even if you're not a big ballet fan, and I'm not, the music and the dancing here is beautiful.  Worth the price for the \"Entrance of the Shades\" section alone."],["The Paris Opera Ballet is without peer (apart from its obtuse unwillingness to promote Emmanuel Thibault to etoile!) If I could award this bluray disc more than five stars I would. This recording has been my favourite on DVD for years. Now that it is out on bluray I would say that perfection has almost been improved upon. The etoiles and the corps have always been superb in this performance but the new format enables the scenery, costumes and music to be enjoyed all the more. Having seen \"La Bayadere\" at the Oprea Garnier in May of this year I would say this disc captures the essence of the experience and more besides. Buy it now!When can we expect to see \"La Belle au Bois Dormant\", \"Casse Noisette\", \"Don Quichotte\" and \"Raymonda\" similarly produced?"],["I always liked ballet since childhood but this one really made me totally hooked. Isabelle Guerin is absolutely beautiful and dances with all the emotions that Nykiya would be feeling. I never liked male ballet dancers thinking they are half-women, until I saw Laurent Hilair in Solar's role and it totally changed my view. I felt like I was wasting my entire life disliking like them. Maybe it is because Hilair is so handsome that he was not wearing excess make-up like the kind I saw in Russian ballet performance but his jump is so high, turns so fast that I literally could not close my mouth after the first \"Wow!.

Most of them featured some sort of plot involving rubes getting themselves into all kinds of trouble. But these movies were not just the wacky hi-jinx of hilarious hillbillies; they were the wacky hi-jinx of hilarious hillbillies who had famous country music stars as friends. In other words, the flimsy plots and fading movie stars were just an excuse to showcase a slew of country music stars of the time.  Many of the performances were lip-synched, although some were recorded live. The Nashville Sound, which was recorded in 1969, was different.  Perhaps influenced by the Pennebaker documentaries of the time, this film had no flimsy plot or corny gags.  Instead, it was a serious look at Nashville and the reigning country stars of the day.  It's well filmed, thorough, and fascinating to watch.  Much of it was filmed at the Grand Ole Opry, but you also get priceless footage such as Loretta Lynn performing for a lunch crowd of radio and record company people, Bashful Brother Oswald singing a chorus of Mountain Dew outside of Ernest Tubb's Record Shop, a rehearsal by the new-to-town Mother Earth (featuring Tracy Nelson), a performance outside Shelby Singleton's house, a recording session featuring Doug Kershaw and a young, beardless Charlie Daniels, and lots more.  There is also lots of great footage of Nashville itself.

It was a treat to see the part with Loretta bantering with her band.  She was a funny lady.  The portion with Johnny Cash: I had forgotten he was ever that young and handsome.  Of course when he made that appearance on the Opry, we were all still screaming for Elvis and didn't want anyone to be better than Elvis.  Well, I have to say, after seeing this again of Johnny Cash singing, he was an excellent singer.  I never thought that in my young days.  It is such a treat to have a record of Roy Acuff balancing his Fiddle Bow on his (I use to think) nose.  I see now in this DVD he actually had it in a pipe of some sort he was holding in his mouth.  It was brief, but I saw it.  And to see Earl Scruggs and his sons, and Lester Flatt with his new band (at the time).  I remember being so sad when they broke up.  And one of Charley Pride's earliest appearances at the Opry.  I remember one of his first shows where he came on stage and he saw people whispering to one another, and he just said, \"yes, folks, it's true, I'm Charley Pride\".  Or something like that.  And I think he told someone that he heard someone in the audience say very loudly, \"he really is\". The masses back then had to be convinced the guy singing those songs on the radio was a black man.  Back then we called him a Negro.  Which was meant with respect.  And it was as opposed to what most southerners called him.  He had them standing with an ovation at the end of the show.  And then there was Bill Monroe out on stage doing his jig.  It is just perfect, but just not enough of it.  I have to have more.  I really want to find one with Don Gibson performing.  I just loved watching him pick his guitar.  I read in one of the books I have that Elvis heard him picking and rehearsing one day at Studio B, where they both recorded.  Elvis asked Chet Atkins (who produced for both of them) who that was and Chet told him and Elvis told Chet he wanted Chet to get Don to show him how he made those licks. I believe Chet had told him that Don called it 2-finger picking.  Chet asked Don and Don told Chet to tell Elvis to get his own style of picking.  Chet went back and told Elvis that he'd have to talk Don into teaching it to him.  He never did.Thanks to Amazon for all these wonderful CDs and DVDs I'm finding."],["I just started getting into country music and I love Johnny Cash.

One glaring example. In a critical scene, the overhead microphone is clearly visible on the film print. This production is not as well done as the Robert Redford-produced films for the PBS Mystery Series and there is a legitimate question about using Lou Diamond Phillips in the lead Jim Chee role. Is Phillips a Navajo? The PBS Series uses Navajo actors.

All four film were produced by Robert Redford.  This film has good scenery, and a good Indian story, but the later three films had better acting, better character development, better scenery, and a more intimate closeness to Indian culture and traditions.  Nevertheless, because we liked the latter three films so much, we were glad to find this film.  We wish Robert Redford would produce some more in the series."],["To begin with, this is not the PBS series.  If you are familiar with Skinwalkers and Coyote Waits from PBS, this is far inferior.  While the story is outstanding, the acting is wooden.  Lou Diamond Phillips is a good actor, but he just can't pull off Jim Chee.  Perhaps I would have had a different opinion if I hadn't seen Adam Beach's outstanding performance as Jim Chee first.  I won't even get in to Fred Ward as Joe Leaphorn.  Suffice it to say that Dark Wind is a Jim Chee novel, so there is little of Joe Leaphorn to be screwed up.On the tech side, this is a really lousy DVD presentation.  It is just a glorified VHS transfer.  The sound is 2 channel, not 5.1.  The presentation is full frame rather than widescreen, and there are plenty of funny intrusions from boom mikes and sun awnings.Nevertheless, as cheap as this is going for, I am glad I bought it.  The story is fantastic.  Really good mystery.  Only two complaints about the writing.  First, there are several totally unnecessary uses of the F-word, as if they were just trying to get an R rating.  I don't mind if profanity is necessary to the story, but even the actors sound like they don't think the word fits their lines.  Second, do we really have to hear EVERYTHING that goes on in Chee's head?  I mean really, the near constant voice overs get rather irritating.If you want a really good adaptation of a Hillerman novel, try Skinwalkers or Coyote Waits.  If you want a passable movie for a Saturday night, try this one."],["I am a long time hillerman fan and waited anxiously for  his movies.  I have seen all of them and this is the truest to the hillerman \"feel\". Usually the movie is not as good as the book and this is true of all the movies.

Lou Diamond Phillips did a fine portrayal of Officer Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police.  Again, the story is a mystery set against the Southwest Reservation properties and surrounding lands.

One of the things I really enjoyed about the books is the feel for the southwest, with the great emptiness that's filled with mystery.  I feel like this movie captured that feel perfectly.  It's worth watching just for the scenery.  I wasn't irritated by hearing Jim Chee's thoughts because that's part of the books.  The young Jim Chee is a kind of quiet bungler on the surface, and not sure of himself.  But he's very smart and figures things out.  I liked the actor who played Jim Chee. I'm not an acting critic, so I was fine with the acting and just enjoyed a really good mystery story."],["Not memorable, but good.  I love Tony Hillerman books, so enjoyed seeing it on the screen.

L.D.P. has set the character of Chee in my mind with a forcefulness that is entirely his own.Searching for the missing man from prison and wondering if as Leaphorn suggest, he may be dealing with two people, kept me wondering too.It was fun to see John Carlin [from Dark Shadows] in the role of someone who is kind to children and a shock the way his character turns out.  Whoops!  Chee started noticing the Kachina dolls in his living quarters.Seeing the mutilated Navajo [on Hopi land] was a shock and left me wondering about a Skinwalker, who was he?When Chee is ordered to find out who is tinkering with the well and sees the plane go down, he is suddenly plunged into the world of mystery, witchcraft [which I don't think he likes], F.B.I. agents and revenge.  I like his solution to the well situation.The F.B.I. seems to think he know more than he is saying.I loved the locations the movie was shot in, the dumpster fire [grin] and finding the long lost truck.

Keep wishing...Seeing Robert Redford's name in the credits of what might pass for a high school film class production is quite a disappointment, but then, if it didn't make the theaters I guess you shouldn't expect much from the cartoon-like characters.The story has no explanation for the two suitcases of cocaine that suddenly appear in Che's truck at the end.  You'll have to read the book to figure that out.Watch for the boom mike overhead on camera, unedited, in the climatic ending scene."],["Hillerman is a wonderful writer who can interweave the beauty of the southwest, the cultures of the Native Americans living there and a good mystery,  Too bad this film did not do that talent justice by using all of the considerable acting abilities of Lou Diamond Phillips.  This is an OK film that could have been really good if the director, actors and writers had put any real effort into it.  As it is, it does give the story a fair telling, and the beauty of the southwest landscape is evident.  However, everyone acts like this a high school production being done for the parents instead of a film being made to present to the public.  It is still a good story, and does entertain especially if you don't mind films that are not done to their best."],["Well now. I came to this film knowing nothing about its media profile, but having read the Tony Hillerman novel of the same name. There is so much bad to say about this pathetic adaptation, that let me first say that I give the production team all credit for actually going to the Navajo and Hopi countries to make the film; for actually using some Navajo and Hopi actors and actresses. HOWEVER, having gone to all the trouble, I would think that they would have made sure that they KEPT THE BOOM MIC OUT OF THE FRAME IN THE CLIMACTIC SCENE OF THE MOVIE!!!! HOLY HELL, PEOPLE!! Who made this trash, ED WOOD?! If you didn't have the budget for the deluvian gully-buster that the denouement requires, why not make one of the other equally clever novels, but one less demanding of special effects? Why change the dead pilot's more easily hoodwink-able sister into his presumably knowledgeable cohort of a wife? Before sitting her down in front of an old fashioned telephone switchboard that even Lily Tomlin's \"Ernestine\" wouldn't recognize, would you care to tell us how she learned to operate it? Hell, I've never even SEEN one in operation, and I'm fifty! Why cast Buford Pusser (now there was a man) as a glaringly Texan Hopi?! And WHY cut the whole clever reason for inviting the bad guys not just to \"a scary ruin\" but to a failing village where a ceremony is going to take place that instead of drawing the expected crowd, actually keeps everyone - potential witnesses - except the night-watching kachinas, INDOORS?! That was the WHOLE POINT!!! As Mel Brooks tells us that Indians sometimes say, \"Oy GEWALT!!\" There's a reason no one has reviewed this turkey before, and it's because no one saw it. It was buried, I imagine, just like Johnson's body would have been, if the torrential runoff from the mesa had actually been there to wash him away at the end of the film. I can only guess what Tony Hillemrman thought when...IF he saw it. He probably felt as if he'd been poisoned with corpse powder. If I had been him, I'd have bought the negative and the prints, and had an Enemy Way sung over their rotting cels. No stars, and many apologies to the Navajo and Hopi for this grotesquely missed opportunity. Actually, I didn't mind LDP as Chee, but think he was so amateurishly directed he couldn't possibly have succeeded in this dog."],["The microphone boom is too low and the mike is visible at the top of the screen in quite a few scenes.  It's intrusive and takes away  from the interest in the story.  This was made on the cheap, obviously.  The PBS films about the Hillerman stories are much better.  This was a bummer all around.  Shipping was fine, just a crummy film."],["I bought this one for my Wife and she enjoyed it just as much as the PBS films.  I'm glad I spotted this."],["If you're a big Hillerman fan, you will enjoy this. It is the first of Hillerman's books that was made into a movie. Not as well made as the newer ones done for PBS, but still worth watching. Follows the book closely."],["There are two versions of this film.  This version, directed by Robert Redford and starring Lou Diamond Phillips as Jim Chee and the PBS version with Adam Beach as Chee and Wes Studi as Leaphorn.  What the author, Tony Hillerman, said about the actors in the making of \"Coyote Waits\" (one of the other PBS specials) was that Wes Studi was the man he saw as Leaphorn and he was beginning to see Jimmy Chee as a good deal more handsome after Adam Beach played him.Well, I'm only seeing Adam Beach as Chee now, myself.  And Fred Ward may be a good actor elsewhere, but Wes Studi's face was what I saw when I read Hillerman's novels, too.The story in short.  Jim Chee (Phillips) is a newly assigned cop to this beat of the Navajo-Hopi rez.  His lieutenant Leaphorn (Ward) sets him on staking out the windmills to see who's destroying them.  In the process, he finds a murdered man and a bigger crime than the windmill massacres.  A drug smuggler's plane crash lands near the spot and Chee finds a dead man inside.  The Federal officers and Leaphorn think he's involved. With the help of a Hopi Deputy (Gary Farmer) he sets out to solve the crime and clear several people's good names.In this particular installation of the Hillerman based films, witchcraft and superstition are strong.  The traditions are fascinating and the plot is complex.  I much prefer the PBS version of \"Skinwalker\" though, even with the lower budget, I think it's the better film.Rebecca Kyle, August 2008"],["Lou Diamond Phillips is an actor who has always been worth watching.

Where do these great ideas come from, a love triangle between bride, groom and best man! That's never been done before...., OK it has been done and there's nothing new and original in this little unpretentious film.

Amy Smart, Seth Green and the very handsome and sexy Stewart Townsend are capable of delivering great stuff. However there was not much they could do with such a boring and unispired script. Another cookie cutter romantic comedy with little substance. It seems Hollywood is churning these out a dime a dozen these days. I love romantic comedies. But so many of these kinds of movies now are just cliche and predictable stories. What a shame, as these actors could have done wonders with a little better material. Despite this, Seth Green manages to handle the comedic aspect of the film very well. And the male lead is excellent eye candy. That pretty much sums up my two stars."],["The story told in this film is as old as time, but it continues to get recycled and re-released each year with a flashy new name and a new cast. Still...this one wasn't bad, and it certainly has some hilarious moments, which are a credit to this worn-out tale.This movie is about a young man (Stuart Townsend) who is flattered to be named Best Man in his friend's wedding! However, wacky hijinks ensue when he falls in love with the bride-to-be (Amy Smart), and begins to work with his fellow groomsmen (Seth Green) to stop the wedding, and get the girl. They attempt to show the bride what a lying, cheating jerk she's about to marry, and that the 'best man' should win.The 'wacky hijinks' include gags as old as dinosaurs (who really falls for the 'wrong church' routine? Honestly!), but despite that, there are some real gems of comedy mixed in with so much recycled material. Seth Green is a real pleasure to watch, and he fits perfectly into his role as instigator and enabler to the groomsmen's misadventures. Stuart Townsend, better known for his roles in dramas and thrillers, steps a little out of his comfort zone in this role by attempting comedy, and romantic comedy at that! While at times it's obvious that he's not used to playing the bumbling, clumsy love interest, Townsend still delivers a believable and heart-warming performance (although Seth Green still shines a little brighter).Bottom line, it's a good romantic comedy if you don't have your heart set on seeing anything original. Then again, Hollywood tends to recycle material all the time, so maybe we shouldn't fault this movie too much for that. I guess if it wasn't *good* material, it wouldn't get recycled, right?

The story by director Stefan Schwartz and Ed Roe is recycled fluff with nothing new added, yet despite that fact the pacing and acting bring off a fun little film.As marriage enters the agenda of old friends, promiscuous James (Steve John Shepherd) is scheduled to marry Sarah (Amy Smart, always a pleasure to watch) and asks his best friend Olly (the talented and hunky Irishman Stuart Townsend in a very nice comedic turn) to be his Best Man.  Olly, a writer whose first chapters have been lauded by his publisher (Simon Callow) and that early praise has thrown him into writer's block forcing him to take a menial job as a PA under grumpy feminist Tania (Johdi May), fears accepting the role of Best Man out of the challenge tied to writing the wedding reception speech.  He is encouraged not to accept the role by his roommate friend Murray (5'4\" Seth Green, who has many comedy roles to his credit - this one being the first with a fine British accent). Murray knows of James' peppered past and sets out to stop the wedding - especially when he discovers that Olly has fallen for Sarah, mistaking her for Sarah's Maid of Honor Becka (Kate Ashfield).Olly is a true friend and will sacrifice his longing for Sarah out of his loyalty to James - until Murray proves that James indeed is a promiscuous lothario.  And the chase, with many a pratfall, begins as Olly ultimately sides with Murray to prevent his losing Sarah.Townsend makes a fine turn out of his obvious role, proving that he not only can master dramatic and intrigue roles, but light comedy ones as well.  Seth Green may be small but he is a powerhouse of physical comedic talent.  Amy Smart doesn't have much to do, but when she is on screen she glows with intelligence as well as beauty.  It is the cast that makes this film work and they are enough of a pleasure to watch to merit sitting through another re-telling of a tired story.

This movie will not inspire great acting or plot writing, but it has an easy feel for anyone who attended high school parties.  The main characters are so clearly older than their high school years that the movie can't be taken seriously.  But the 2 buddies, Joe and Hubbs, play contrasting roles that click, personality wise.  Their main desire is to knock back some Ox 45 talls, and score chicks.  It's a cult classic because it generates so many catch phrases and behaviors that it hammers time and time again in the movie.  Ox 45 tall cans, betraying someone is \"worming\" them, everyone knows \"Krumps brother\", when asked who someone specific is - they're just \"some dude\", Shnapps is \"Shnappster\", which makes you hork, overweight girls have \"big buffalo butts\", a party is determined by it's ratio (of boys to girls), and so on and so on. There are many little things you will catch as you watch the movie over and over.  This movie blows away Dazed and Confused and should be mandatory watching for all incoming high school freshmen!!"],["This is really one of those under appreciated, under distributed, under exposed films that belongs in your collection. That is if you like the high school stoner burnout kind of comedies. The acting is kind of stiff in some places, but the cast is fairly young and inexperienced. James Melkonian did a good job of creating very stereotypical, yet semi believable characters. Although his use of foreshadowing in the beginning is about as subtle as a shot gun blast to the face. He creates a genuine atmosphere though, although never having been to Torrance I can only guess as to whether it's an accurate portrayal of the area...however previous reviews have stated that it is...so...right on! One of my favorite aspects of the film is the memorable characters... I don't ever remember seeing a film where I remembered so much about the supporting characters. Tack, Hanky, Mike Dick and Mike New York, Crump, Crumps Brother, Muldoon, Officer Dean, Jills Dad, The Buffalo Chicks... Maybe they are so memorable because we all had friends like them in high school! The dynamic between the two main characters, Joe and Hubbs is so real it's almost unreal. Of course it's the stereotypical dominant/submissive friend relationship, but Melkonian explores it well in The Stoned Age. You have the cool, outgoing, macho Hubbs matched up with the, shy, introverted, clumsy Joe. Together they cruise Torrance looking for a good time. They encounter countless obstacles on their way to finding hot chicks...and Joe is confronted with by his spirit guide, the gnarly eyeball, on his quest to find out if there really is 'something more out there.' But of course we all just think he's weriding out on us. This movie is definitely worth checking out! Normally I dislike the director commentary track that seems to be really popular with dvd's these days, but this one actually offers some  commentary that is very interesting, considering the film is so obscure that even the people who worked on it probably don't really know much about its production. The Stoned Age is seriously one of those B movie cult classics that will be loved by the few people who see it, myself included. So give it a try...what can you lose but an hour and half that you probably would have just wasted doing something productive anyway."],["This is like deja vu all over again... It is a classic / fun movie that makes me re-live my high school days.  It has great music with BOC, Nugent, Foghat, Sabbath, and the others that we listened to while we were out looking for chicks - and what ever else... It also has some nice T & A with Laney, but China Katner is the real girl that you wish your never passed up.  Joe, please jump on that grenade!!!!  Watch until the very end credits to see Buck Darhma and Eric Bloom from BOC try to sell Joe and Hubbs a shirt.  Don't fear the reaper is one of my fav songs of all time - so this movie is always at the front of my ones to watch when I need to relax.  Get your buddies together and watch The Stoned Age together with Dazed and Confused and you will have to jump in the car and go cruising for chicks!"],["Love this movie. Hilarious throwback to the 70's"],["Like some other reporters here, I also have found an issue with the disc, although it plays just fine. The alleged \"16X9 widescreen\" listed on the box looks suspiciously like what I'd call \"unformatted full screen\": the picture has been carelessly zoomed into the center of the frame, cutting the credits in half and lopping off characters' skullcaps. And no, my zoom is not mistakenly on.That's alright, though. I can still hear the classic lines just fine, and see most of Renee Ammann as she's lying there on the bed asleep (except her nice posterior got chopped off thanks to the lousy framing).The only thing I'll add to the argument about whether or not The Stoned Age is better than Dazed and Confused is this: the only one you'll find any sex or nudity in is The Stoned Age.I think we have our winner.;)And be sure to stay tuned after the end credits for two very special surprise guests.

Dazed &amp; Confused was more mainstream and The Stoned age was more like a cult classic. Dazed and Confused was a smarter type of humor flick. The Stoned age is a dumb humor flick. Think of it this way. Pissing in someones ice cube tray=Stoned age, pouring paint on the head of a jackass for revenge=Dazed &amp; Confused. Two different types of movies but both are very funny and well made. Both soundtracks are great also. BOC was rocking just as hard and just as good as most of the bands on the D&amp;C soundtrack. Just 2 different styles. I recommend both movies. Or rent em both and compare yourself."],["When a friend told me to check out this movie, i was under the impression that it was a good ol' stoner comedy.

It doesn't have an All-Star cast like Dazed, but the hilarity of the plot more than makes up for it !!

AND, it arrived on April 16th, as opposed to May 2nd! Thanks Silver Platters!"],["&quot;The Stoned Age&quot; followed on the heels of the immensely interesting &quot;Dazed and Confused,&quot; doubtless in an effort to cash in on the cultic success of that film. Both films deal with the perennial problems of the stoner, those largely ignored characters you saw shuffling through the halls of high school in a perpetual stupor. Usually, these hep cats had hair down to their ankles, giggled a lot, and managed to work the word &quot;man&quot; into every sentence they uttered. Everyone knew what these guys and gals were up to, even the teachers, but by an almost unspoken agreement everyone left them alone (unless they blatantly broke the rules). Hollywood has a sort of love affair with these affable losers, and even went so far as to have Sean Penn immortalize the stoner in the memorable early 1980's effort &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High.&quot; Yep, the stoner is here to stay, folks, even if a few years go by without us seeing one of them in a film. If nothing else, the ability to get some cheap laughs out of fried brain cells insures the character's longevity. &quot;The Stoned Age&quot; is stoner humor at its absolute dumbest.Still, the movie has its charms. &quot;The Stoned Age&quot; follows the misadventures of two longhaired losers, Joe and Hubbs, on one of their nightly excursions around town. The two guys drive a car all dolled up with Blue Oyster Cult graphics (amateurishly done, of course) looking for babes, parties, and mind-altering chemicals. In the course of their quest, they encounter a whole host of offbeat characters. The most memorable of these dolts is Tack, a pimpled goof who has all the appeal of a speed bump. The guy picks his nose, whines incessantly, and generally makes a total fool of himself. Tack will reappear throughout the movie like an unpleasant rash, but the first time Joe and Hubbs meet up with him they learn a wonderful secret. It seems that the local thug plans on partying with two gorgeous babes in a house on the outskirts of town. When our two heroes pry this information out of Tack, they decided to take matters into their own hands. The girls do turn out to be hot, but problem after problem nearly thwarts Joe and Hubbs efforts right from the start. One of the girls wants a jug of liquor before she will let the guys in the door, an item difficult to obtain when you are a minor. Then there are all of the guys in town who learn about the party and want to horn in on Joe and Hubbs. Throw in some cops, the father of one of the girls who suddenly comes home in a rage, some ugly chicks, and you just now the antics will unfold at a frantic pace.When &quot;The Stoned Age&quot; works, it works very well. Tack is an amusing character instantly familiar to anyone who lived this sort of lifestyle back in high school. He's the guy always trying to ingratiate himself in the activities of others even though no one wants him around unless he has something useful to contribute. I laughed at the cop who always gave the kids the same line about how he used to like to party when he was young. I even liked looking at the girls, especially the hyper cynical Jill (played by Grace Slick's daughter China Kantner) although I didn't understand the constant comments about her being &quot;ugly.&quot; Taylor Negron and Jake Busey turn up in small but funny roles as a disco dancing liquor store clerk and a preppie party host respectively. The actors who play Joe and Hubbs do an effective if slightly over the top turn as the two wacked out stoners. All of the characters embody many funny yet occasionally uncomfortable truths about that extremely awkward age of roughly fifteen to twenty.What I didn't care for about the movie centers on Joe's metaphysical experiences at a Blue Oyster Cult concert. Every so often one of the character's allude to a part of the concert where a laser light hit Joe right in the face, which led to some strange out of body experience. We see what happened at the end of the film in a decidedly unfunny flashback sequence that borrows heavily from Kubrick's &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey.&quot; Yeah, I understand how important music is to teenage kids under the influence--my poison was Rush and Pink Floyd--but I felt a bit let down with Joe's BOC experience. Listening to Joe attempt to explain his experience is amusing, especially when we see the reactions of the people listening to him, but overall the idea fails. Furthermore, I quickly tired of Hubbs's hyper aggressive personality. Again, I knew a few people exactly like this character, the jerk always looking for a fight with anyone in a vain attempt to make up for some feelings of inadequacy. The problem here is that it is just overdone and soon becomes unfunny and banal.I have criticized a few central aspects of the film, but I cannot bash the movie too much. &quot;The Stoned Age&quot; is a funny, mindless film everyone should watch at least once. Heck, the puke scene is worth the price of admission alone. Sadly, the DVD edition lacks a lot of extras even as it offers a widescreen picture transfer. &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; is definitely the better of the two, however, if for no other reason than that movie attempts to temper its hijinks with a deeply reflective timbre. If you just want to laugh and forget about it the next day, &quot;The Stoned Age&quot; is the way to go."],["&quot;Better than &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;!&quot; according to the blurb on the dvd case when I ran across this movie in the store, so I took a chance.  Sorry,wrong.  D. &amp; C. is one of the best films of its genre (teen angst flicks).  The problem with this film is every single character is so obnoxious, there's no one to identify with, making it impossible to care what happens to anyone.  Avoid at all costs."],["This is probably my all-time favorite party movie.  Hubbs and Joe are like a modern day Cheech & Chong.  This movie had me laughing so hard, I was crying.  I can totally relate to The Stoned Age, because I'm from a small town, and that is all me and my friends did was \"drive around trying to get drunk, stoned, and laid\".  The blonde does get naked in this, but i didnt think that she was as hot as everyone else did.  I highly recommend this movie!!  It IS better than Dazed and Confused."],["Overall a worth while movie to watchbut not as good as Dazed and Confused or Fast Times at Ridgemont High"],["This is without any doubt my all-time favorite movie. I can understand that it doesn't appeal to everyone, it's not a flick for the masses after all and the humour is more subtle than you might think at first glance. \"These are my buds: Mike Dick and Mike New York.\" - \"You're from New York??\" - \"NO.\" - if you don't find dialogues like this extremely brilliant and funny then most probably you won't grasp the humour of \"The Stoned Age\". If you're expecting a movie featuring kids getting stoned or something totally exaggerated like \"Half-Baked\", you might be disappointed as well.It's also pretty low budget though I like the weird light effects (e.g. the slightly neon-coloured walls in some rooms of the house). What I love most about the movie are the countless details. When I first saw it, ca. 1996, I enjoyed it but forgot most of it pretty quickly. What remained stuck in my mind was the unique overall atmosphere of the movie created to a large extent by the soundtrack, especially by its pivotal tune \"Don't Fear The Reaper\" by Blue Oyster Cult.(\"If it's BOC, how can it be pussy?\" - another classic quote.) Years later I got the movie on video and watched it again. And again. And again. And there were still some details I hadn't noticed until the 30th time I watched it.The DVD features are rather poor but if you're a fan you'll L*O*V*E the audio commentary - this is enough to make the DVD a must have. Well, of course, the movie itself is enough...The comparisons to \"Dazed And Confused\" are indeed pretty inappropriate becuause it has a totally different approach. Personally I think \"Dazed And Confused\" was OK but it's a little overrated. Needless to say which one of the two movies I prefer...Any comparisons to \"Cheech&Chong;\" (especially any C&C; but the first one), \"Half-Baked\" or \"Jay & Silent Bob\" border on blasphemy."],["I love this movie and the DVD is great and has extra features like full-length director audio commentary.

There are many unforgettable moments and great one liners you'll be using for years."],["I saw this in the theater(yup, it actually had a theatrical release for a day or so) at the perfect age-17.  Anyone who went to high school can recall the years of 16 and 17 to be the years of that mindless activity called \"cruising\"(of course, I know some losers in their 30s who continue to do this, I'm sure you do too).  At that age you could drive, but you couldn't buy cigarettes, liquor or get into a bar, so what could you do?  Go cruising!  The idea was to meet girls with varying degrees of success.  If you can relate to that, you'll get some degree of entertainment from The Stoned Age which starts off with this premise.  This film is over exaggerated but ironically very realistic at the same time.  Everyone knew someone like Tack-some annoying schmuck who would usually find his way into your car somehow.  Everyone's also ended up at a party thrown by a bunch of idiots from a totally different \"class\" or \"scene\" than you. And who didn't know a couple of \"Buffalo Chicks?\" If you were one of those guys who took the \"nice guy\" approach to getting women, you'll totally identify with Joe.  You can literally feel his frustration as he desperately attempts to woo the amazingly sexy Laney, only to have her jump in the sack with a sexist jerk who seduces her through...well....acting like a jerk.  If you were a womanizing jerk like Hubbs, then you'll relive fond memories as you watch him get the chick through the most juvenile tactics available.  I didn't grow up in the 70s, but it was the perfect setting for this film.  The lingo is accurate, the music great, and the issues and concepts are still relevant today;  The rich disco kids and their hatred for the lower/middle class hard rock stoners for example.  Cruising, of course. People should really stop the comparisons to Dazed and Confused.  That quote on the box was a bad idea, the director even says so in the commentary track!  Two different films, folks.  The only thing they have in common is the time period and some stoner characters.  Would you compare Monty Python and The Holy Grail to Excalibur coz they take place in the same time period and have a few similar themes?  Back to the music I mentioned before, I was very impressed with the soundtrack.  In the commentary, the director mentions that this whole film was to be strictly Led Zeppelin songs, but it couldn't be done financially.  Thank God for that!  That would have been way too cliche.  This movie works so much better with a soundtrack with no Led Zeppelin.  God forbid there were other bands in the 70s other than Zeppelin, alot of them better, believe it or not.  In this film we get songs by Ted Nugent, Deep Purple, Focus, Montrose, references to the Scorpions, and The Blue Oyster Cult takes center stage.  That's cool coz BOC don't get the respect they deserve anymore.  The cast of unknowns does a decent enough job.  I'm not sure why the character of Jill is refered to as an \"oinker\" and \"hoagley\".  Throughout the film, we keep getting reinforced the notion that Jill is supposed to be unattractive.  Well, just watch the film and see if you think Jill is unattractive.  Sure, maybe she doesn't leap off the screen like Laney, but she is one good looking woman.  Of course, Laney is always dressed skimpy while Jill is isn't.  Jill also looks the most 70s, Laney doesn't.  Anyhow, this film is a sure gem to discover if you did the cruising thing in high school or were a teenager in the 70s.  Also, to really enjoy this, totally disregard that Dazed and Confused quote on the box."],["Why anyone would waste more than 3 or 4 sentences reviewing this garbage movie is beyond me.

If you were a teenager in the late seventies or early eighties,you will definitely relate to this movie! On the box of this film it says:Even better than Dazed And Confused! Now that may or may not be true,but I think the films are too different to compare. I think one reason this movie never really took off is because of this comment on the box. I think many people rented it thinking this was going to be just like D.A.C., then after realizing it wasn't they were disappointed and turned off by it. But viewing the movie on it's own terms, you will realize how fun it really is. I have to admit it isn't a big box office film,but more like a B movie. But many B movies are better than the big budgeted ones, and this one proves this point. The main characters are Joe and Hubbs,and you will probably find yourself relating to one or the other. Hubbs is the confident,cocky type who tends to do things before thinking about the consequences of his actions,and Joe is more of the intellectual,geeky headbanger.

Its sometimes hard to tell with the clothing they had her wearing on this show, but the attentive viewer will notice what a glorious rack Anne Shedeen had. Those puppies were just begging to burst forth from those restrictive blouses and sweaters. I curse the producers of ALF for not putting her into more cleavage revealing outfits, so I guess we'll have to let our imaginations suffice. Kate Tanner started a trend I noticed in sitcoms where a sexy housewife is paired with a nerdy gooberish dork for a husband. So kudos to Kate Tanner.

I do not understand why the company would not make the full versions available for purchase.The problem is that people usually either love alf or hate it.

Like others have stated, the episodes are cut (edited) to shreds.  The cuts DO change the feel and intended meaning of some of the scenes and even entire episodes.  After breaking down and buying the German sets from Amazon.de, I am appalled at just how much has been cut from some of the episodes.

Watch Alf once an you will be hooked on it."],["I was so irritated when WGN canceled the retro Sunday night lineup. Fortunately, every show was available on DVD, including all the ALF episodes. It would begin at 7:00 and run until 2 AM. This is how I fell in love with ALF. Every Sunday I put this dvd series in and try to remember how good it was before they wrecked the line-up. That lineup had it all, for us classic tv fans; everything from WKRP to Bewitched and The Honeymooners, to name a few. I have never been able to convince the managers to start this up again. There was always the lame excuse of it coming down to decisions from the supplier. WHAT?? Since when does a buyer not call the shots. It's like me going into a store and the manager tells me I'm going to buy a SPEEDO or else. I wanted a pair of Levi's. I only wish that enough of us readers here could get together and insist that they bring back the classic line-up.ALF has become one of my favorite shows and I'm hoping that they find some lost episodes. The acting ranges from so-so to excellent. I have to give the parents and the son a two star rating, as well as the neighbors, the Oggmonicks? Five star ratings go out to Andrea Elson, whom I never remembered as being such a \"babe\". Aside from that, try to catch her expressions of impatience and mild anger. Those looks are authentic. Then, lastly, there is ALF. He was 5 stars all the way! Although a character, his acting/voice were top-notch."],["Alf was just good family watching. I I I Love It.  See how your grandchildren react to the good old days of TV.  They will love it."],["It is very sad that Lions Gate released ALF in a syndicated version meaning that there is 4-5 minutes of original programming missing. Also it is sad that there are reviewers who give this 4 or 5 stars even though the program is not complete. To illustrate to those misguided 4 and 5 star reviewers next time you go to a baseball game stay for only for 7 innings, or when you watch your next football game watch for only 3 quarters. Or next time you watch your favorite program turn it off with 5 minutes left. We all know the show is very funny, the bad ratings is because of cut-up syndicated version. I will give all of you 4 and 5 star reviewers a  dollar, if you will use it to buy a clue."],["I love the ALF Series. I wasnt too happy about the syndication but these DVD's will have to do. Season Three had a lot of great episodes sure to make you laugh again and again. Still a great show over 10 years later."],["Season 3 sees the show reach its peak as it begins to weave in more complex storylines amidst the comedic situations.  With two seasons behind them, Paul Fusco and the actors hit their stride and are completely comfortable with their characters.  Thus, there's a naturalness to everyone's performances.  Alf is for all intents and purposes real.  Also, with Alf's clumsiness and general mayhem more subdued (after being the focus for two seasons), the show is able to actually touch upon far more serious fair without sacrificing the traditional Alf style of humor.  Concepts such as losing (or clinging to)moral integrity (My Back Pages), fear of absolesence (Baby Love, Stairway to Heaven), abject loneliness (Alone Again Naturally, Standing in the Shadows of Love), catastrophic expectation (Shake, Rattle and Roll), and even grief and death (funeral for a friend).  Even those episodes that aren't as weighty have more complex and intresting elements, eg., \"Like an Old Time Movie\" which has Alf and Jake constructing a script starring the Tanners that plays out like an old silent movie (and brilliantly so); \"Have You Seen My Mother Baby\" has Jake confront his mother who he discovers is a thief; \"Running Scared\" deals with a blackmailer inside the FBI...  There's a lot of really good writing going on this season!ALF was a show that always mixed somewhat childlike (or childish depending on your POV) low-brow humor with heart, but with the third season and the onset of far more somber themes, the show actually transcends its premise and becomes something much more affecting.  And as a result, the humor is that much funnier, emerging as it does from human emotions and situations.  Alf's fears of being the only one of his kind is genuinely moving; his concerns that we should savor life because we all might \"croak\" tomorrow is touching because it's real; his sorrow at the fact that a new infant in the house will leave him without any attention or love is understandable (it's also a great thematic continuity nod to the second season's episode about the lost dog.)Some will complain because all they want out of the show are the more crass elements (Alf burping and breaking things), while others will deride the fact that the producers and writers even attempt to rise above the show's \"station\" as basically junk TV.  But what the critics fail to see is that ALF is essentially escapist entertainment -- and there is a place for that -- but not one without heart, and not one that can't at times touch upon the human condition.  And when the show does rise to more complex themes, it works and it works well, becoming funnier and more memorable.The bottom line is that ALF is great family entertainment that won't leave you feeling brain-dead or like you've ingested too many sugar substitutes.  The only criticism is the DVD release itself which presents the edited syndicated versions (which had to cut some scenes to make room for more commercials.)  The show is still great, but it's unfortunate to not have the full versions."],["I have been very tolerant with previous ALF releases.  They have all contained syndicated episodes.  I didn't care so much about the first season, because I just figured that since the show was no longer on TV, the DVDs were the only way to see the show.Then the second season came out, again in syndication.  I bought it because the show still was not on the air.  Then I saw something shocking.  During one of the episodes in the second season, there was music substituted, and the episode was shorter than I'd seen on TV Land.  That was downright unacceptable.So now we're at season three.  Syndicated episodes again.  This  time one episode ran for under 19 minutes!  I love ALF, and hate to see him get treated this way.The episodes are all fantastic, and I'm still happy to own the DVDs, but the syndication thing has got to stop.Unfortunately, this seems to be a recurring pattern with TV show box sets.  The first season sets of both Roseanne and The Cosby Show were released in syndicated form.  No studio in the world would ever dream of releasing edited movies, so why would so many want to release edited TV series?  It's just wrong.Season four will be out in September, or so I hear.  I will probably buy it just to complete the set."],["it is just a pity that they cutted out so many scenes.... if someone like me, knows every single word they say and then there are many funny parts missing i can not rate this item with 5 stars....but the show itself is the most adorable show in the world...alf is such a lovable alien.... i would love to have my own alf ;)"],["Our family enjoyed Alf, when it first appeared on TV and still enjoy Alf's humor.

This season shows more full body shots and the writing seems to have changed a bit, and the introduction music was different, as well. I still marvel at the puppet work, and it really is reminiscent of the Looney Tunes characters' facial expressions, which would say so much, even without words.

Down the road, a RESPONSIBLE studio will no doubt pick up the slack and release the complete series, uncut.

Kate is pregnant, the baby is born, and then in the next episode they appear to have shoved the baby back in because she's pregnant again. Apparently when they edited this DVD, they didn't notice the discrepancy.

It doesn't matter how old you are you will fall in love with the old Alfer either for the first time or all over again.  It amazes me that this series still holds up so well, it hasn't really dated (apart from the clothing, decour ect...) the idea of an Alien crash landing into a family's garage and staying with them is as appealing now as it was in 1986.  Alf the puppet hasn't dated, he still looks real, like E.T. still looks real, he hasn't dated. The one liners are still present, the jokes are still funny, the storylines are still watchable over and over again.  This series has 28 episodes, that's because two of the episodes are from series 4!!Fever and Mind Games! Can't Lions Gate get anything right?? This DVD loses two stars because this is the sydicated version, we don't have syndication in the UK, we call them repeats and they're always shown uncut. For instance friends must have been shown over 200 times in the Uk, everytime uncut.  Rosanne is uncut over here on DVD as far as i know. Alf hasn't been shown in England for many years though and i'm still waiting for his hit talk show to air or come to DVD.  Look, the truth is boycotting this DVD won't help, the studio will think there's no demand for the title and so they'll delete it and not order any more copies.  When somebody sugests releasing the episodes uncut then, the studio bigwigs will point out that the episodes have been released and didn't sell.  Maybe if we buy this and it sells a lot of copies they'll bow to presure and release the episodes uncut, but i doubt it, Lions Gate have stated that the original episodes are in bad condition and won't transfer well compared to the sydicated ones, although cutting the music and some of the songs makes it look like they don't want to pay for the rights to them.  And how come the Alf Files was released uncut?? I seriously doubt that they'll release the episodes again, so buy this and enjoy... this maybe the only chance a new generation has to get hooked on the wacky Alien like we did when we were younger.  I've ordered my copy and i sugest you do the same, these are some of the best AlF episodes ever made and if you're waiting for the uncut episodes, i'm willing to bet you'll be waiting a long time.  ALF is the best television series from the 1980's and is still hillarious today, cut yeah, but even that can't take away from the shows absolute genius!! I dislike the cut's too but some ALF is better than no ALF! Paul Fusco...hand your head in shame.  Why didn't you just put your foot down and demand the original episodes be cleaned up?? This is a great season, it's just a shame that some of the best material ended up on the cutting room floor...american networks make me sick, sydication, slam a few more adverts in there, make a bit more money.  As you can see this review is kinda up and down, that's how i feel though, i'm happy it's out but sad it's cut... Alf is 20 years old...we should be celebrating...not feeling sad about these releases, it's amazing that this show was even made with it's ofbeat concept.

However, I can't defend him here. The movie is a dud. High school production methods, looks like it was shot with a cam-corder in one day.No wonder it never made it to the theaters, they couldn't get distribution, no one would handle it.If you're a die-hard RD fan, then here are the films you want to see, in descending order of quality:1.  Back To School2. Caddyshack3. Easy MoneyThat's it.  He's still great live, though. Saw him at Radio City Music Hall in May, 2001 and he lit the place up."],["The only major key elements saving this comedy is Dangerfield's amazingly sarcastic humorous jokes and facial expressions,the lovely babes who play his wives, and the the tongue-in-cheek humor on a certain religion. Otherwise, the story is forgettable. Andrew Dice Clay again plays a typical role as memorable as his acting career.As for the story itself, it's about a construction developer from L.A. who purchases land in a Mormon town-community to build a ski-lodge resort. What he did not realize was that in bidding and gaining the land he would also inherit several wives from the previous landowner who has since passed away (it's a major part of the community's religious tradition). He,himself must also become a Mormon in order to join the township as a citizen to own the land.The rest involves crooked bankers/loan officers, mob king pins based in Las Vegas, and uptight conservative Mormon town folk...Despite all the films flaws, it's Rodney's humor that delivers every time. My only recommendation for any true die-hard Rodney Dangerfield fan is to skip this 100 minute flick and watch his stand up performances on the Jay Leno Show.At least on the Leno Show Rodney cuts to the chase and gets to his comedy gags !...This comedy flick rates 3 stars...One for Rodney,One for the babes, and One for some of the other miscellaneous antics and gag-jokes !"],["It's Rodney.  Good ol' self-effacing Rodney -- my favorite brand of humor, and a happy addition to my video library.  :-)"],["I believe My 5 Wives is one of the funniest movies starring Rodney Dangerfield that I've seen yet.  I watched another Rodney movie where he went back to school (in fact, Back to School is the name of it) and Rodney's humor in that movie doesn't touch the more upbeat and hilarious style performed in My 5 Wives.  Perhaps there was some kind of restriction in place back in the mid 80's that wouldn't allow us to witness Rodney's *true* side (since My 5 Wives is clearly more joke-oriented).  Who knows.As you've probably figured out, the storyline is about Rodney becoming religious and specifically a polygamist.  He inherits 5 attractive women and basically takes over a small town with generous tips and charity donantions thanks to having the money to do so (thanks to a top-notch laywer and a divorce settlement that turns in his favor).  At first the townspeople accept him with open arms despite his offbeat, \"always quick to blurt out a witty remark\" style of humor but later on when they find out he's been spending counterfeit dollars (unintentionally unbeknownst to even Rodney) well, things change in a hurry.  My favorite part is probably when the girls take a trip to Las Vegas and turn into naughty girls!  The skiing/snowmobile segment at the end -despite being *extremely* exaggerated- is another high point.  Actually Rodney executes several hilarious lines while riding in the back of a garbage truck.I had no idea that was Andrew Dice Clay playing the role of the tough Italian guy, haha.  I forgot all about HIS style of comedy- more raunchy!  I recall his standup routines in the mid 90's and how my dad and his girlfriend were reluctant to let me watch them given my young age and the inappropriate topics he was discussing, but they ultimately gave in since I was a teenager at the time.I swear, Rodney's at the top of his game in this movie.  Without giving away the actual jokes, a certain one about holding open elevator doors, a false allegation involving his ex-wifes chest, terrible cooking and having to bring Tums for the ants, to the joke about stimulating the wrong female body parts... he's flat out *awesome* in this movie.I could seriously listen to Rodney's well-constructed style of humor all night long, haha.  I HIGHLY recommend My 5 Wives.  Oh sure, the actual plot is pretty weak but it's all about Rodney so none of that should matter."],["I could not find this movie anywhere, it is to funny, it's Rodney Dangerfield at his very best, thank you so much for having it in stock"],["Here's a guy who's been through the wringer with marriages. While trying to buy land in Utah for a ski lodge, his fortunes once again lead him into marriage...and then some!!"],["This  movie was a waste of time ...not funny at all.

Skip this one, there are better films starring Rodney Dangerfield than this one."],["MY 5 WIVES (Writ. Rodney Dangerfield, 2000, 100 minutes) left me surprised firstly because Dangerfield managed to do five more films plus two TV shows before his passing in 2004 (which left me weeping for days).This silly, straight-to-DVD-looking comedy tells the story of LA native Monte Peterson, a land developer eyeballing some prime land in Utah for a ski resort. Looking to bring jobs into the community, Monte finds a community made up of weird religious people - a sort of comedic blend of Amish and Mormon. Since the buyer of land left by a decedent also \"buys\" the deceased's wives, Monte finds himself having to marry three wives in order to finalize the deal.As ever, Dangerfield is game for the silliest of excuses to make his jokes on film. While nothing can ever really approach the genius of hisEasy Money, it's always fun to see anything with Dangerfield in it. Well, almost anything. This film has an odd significance just now because it is a clear stab at Mormonism, and we are days away from an election that could see a Mormon weirdo win the presidency. The film somehow bobs up and down comedically without being offensive to Mormonism. It does manage to be 100% offensive toward women.If you're a fan, then you'll like this and, as Dangerfield always plans, you'll roll your eyes in exasperation just when he wants you to - but he can still produce a great belly laugh when he wants to, his face as rubbery as ever.With the talents of Jerry Stiller, Andrew Dice Clay (I know, I was stunned too) and the great John Byner."],["Not the best Rodney Dangerfield film, but funny. Rodney carries this movie with his oneliners, other than that this movie probably wouldn't have much else to offer.

The writers could have done much more with his character, it is obvious his character wasnt written for him specifically or the director wanted to keep his performance second to Dangerfields.Very little cameo perfomances by other up and comming comics, so dont expect much.The film looks like a &quot;Made for TV&quot; movie and also looks like it was shot using video... possible to lower production costs.Overall if you like Dangerfield, youll like this movie."],["I don't know why Rodney Dangerfield's movie &quot;My 5 Wives&quot; did not receive a wide theatrical release, since it is his funniest film in years.  The jokes start right from the beginning, when Rodney is in divorce court.  &quot;Every time I wanted sex, my wife left the room to give me privacy!  The last time I had sex, I was arrested for assault with a dead weapon!&quot;, he tells his lawyer.  Also appearing in the movie are John Byner, playing a crooked banker, Andrew Dice Clay, who plays a Mafia underboss and Jerry Stiller, playing a Mafia don who knew Rodney when they were both kids in the old neighborhood.  As Rodney tells Jerry regarding his father, &quot;In our neighborhood, he was the first one to start acupuncture - with an ice pick!&quot;A memorable scene is when Rodney takes his 5 wives to Las Vegas.  At first, they appear poolside wearing one piece bathing suits that were in style a hundred years ago.  Rodney takes them clothes shopping.  They return poolside wearing very skimpy bikinis, followed by Rodney in a speedo!  The DVD includes deleted scenes, cast and crew information, and actors' interviews.  The actresses who play his 5 wives are interviewed while they're wearing their bikinis.  I respect that!"],["Rodney Dangerfield is funny in small doses. This movie was just not that funny, unless you are the fan of oneliners repeated every few seconds. Will donate this one to the used book sale in town."],["You have to admit it: Rodney Dangerfield chose an offbeat & provocative subject to do a comedy on. And what's funnier than having Rodney--the \"no respect\" guy--marrying five young & beautiful wives? It's a premise that's a gold mine of laughs! Rodney plays Monte Peterson, a real-estate contractor who comes across some prime land to build a ski lodge in Utah. The catch: In order to use his land, he has to join the Mormon religion...which automatically gives him his many wives! His purchase immediately raises the ire of a shifty banker (John Byner) who happens to be in a \"stronghold\" partnership with a Las Vegas gangster (Andrew Dice Clay, beautifully cast) who has a secret land scheme that will turn the community upside-down. But Peterson's got his own problems: A trip to Vegas to treat his wives goes awry when both the city's fast living & a gung-ho feminist author (Molly Shannon) quickly corrupt the girls, opening up their eyes to women's lib. Worse, Byner sends his portly minion to Vegas in hopes of catching Peterson smoking or drinking as proof to ex-communicate him.Rodney's likable & in top form in this one, rattling off some terrific one-liners, and getting into mischief as usual. The one flaw is the action sequences. The jail breakout, with Rodney riding in a trash bin, has some obvious stunt double work; and the ski chase is marred with stunt work that's obviously not Rodney. This kind of stuff gives the film a \"B-movie\" feel. Still, I laughed from start to finish...and that's good enough for me!"],["As usual Rodney Dangerfield was one of the funniest comedians in the business.

Here, Rodney is a would-be ski lodge builder who finds that to buy some Utah mountain property for his lodge, he has to adopt the local splinter Mormon beliefs.  That somehow includes taking three wives, and they become five.  He gets some tired gags out of how he has to bed these five beauties, then he takes them to Las Vegas, they quickly become liberated at a seminar, and help save Rodney from a couple smalltown hustlers including a banker played by John Byner, fronting for a mob guy played by Andrew Dice Clay, who wants the property for his uncle, played by Jerry Stiller.  Lots of Dangerfield gags, many of them heard many times before, a chase scene in which Rodney's double bests the bad guys, and all turns out well in the end.

The Mango/J.Lo catfight was definitely worth watchin just for the part where Mango calls her J.Ho, which I thought was hysterical. The DeMarco Brothers sketch with Bon Jovi I thought had some great lines, especially at the end where Jon Bon Jovi tricks Kyle (Chris) and his brother Sean (Chris Parnell) into thinking they want them (they're interpretive dancers) to work for them and telling them to go just when they have their hopes up. \"Goth Talk\" was hysterical, especially when Will Ferrell came out as Baron Nocturna and read a eulogy for dear departed Azrael Abyss (Kattan).As a whole, this dvd is a very good retrospective of Chris's seven years as a cast member. However, a with most of the best of's, there were a few sketches that didn't work. They could've chosen a better (not to mention longer) Roxbury Guys sketch, preferrably the one where Jack Nicholson guest starred. Likewise, the Mr. Peepers sketch wasn't too great, either. In my opinion, the best Mr. Peepers sketch was the very first one with Tom Hanks where they go on \"The Tonight Show\" and wreack havoc on the set. Sketches that didn't work at all were the \"Update\" bit with Keri Strugg and the Siamese twins sketch with Jennifer Garner at the end.

Amazon is indeed awesome!"],["When I bought this, I was expecting it to be good...and I was right; it is a good all-around DVD. Most of the skits on here are gut-bustingly funny, like his 'Mr.Peepers' and 'Mango'. I have been let down by previous 'Best of SNL's' before, but this one came through. Now, some of his best work is not here. Some of the skits are just alright, and some of the good ones are short, but despite those couple cons, I still highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is a fan of comedy."],["I grew up watching SNL and Chris Kattan was one of my favorites, so I was super excited when I seen this DVD for sale. Now when I received it in the mail then watched it, I was a teeny bit disappointed. Sure it had Mr.. Peepers and Antonio...but they could have chosen a better skit of Mango. I would have rather watched the whole Garth Brooks/Mango skit instead of the J-Lo/Mango skit. I'm not really a J-Lo fan anyway so maybe I'm a bit bias. :P And the whole Crocodile Hunter skit would have been nice too instead of just 15 seconds of it.However everyone likes different things. So what doesn't make me laugh will not necessarily be the same for you. I did like the DVD don't get me wrong - I just think they could have added a few more things. On the upside we have the Bon Jovi skit which was a riot. And GOTH TALK! I'd say it's worth it purchasing. You'll get a laugh."],["When I put this DVD in, I was very depressed.  I was sulking over the disaster my life has become.  I really didn't expect Chris Kattan to make me laugh at all, nevermind getting me to laugh until I cried and my chest hurt.I think the skit with JLO was the most boring of all.  Sorry, but she can't act, not even when she's playing herself.  I'm not real thrilled with the Mango skits in general.But the ones that really had me rolling?  There's one that Kattan plays a washed-up Las Vegas lounge style comedian, complete with out dated polyester suit and hairless scalp.  What got me about this skit were the cocktail servers walking in front of the camera.  My God!  Their expressions of sheer boredom and burnout were incredible!  I worked in Vegas for ten years, and man!  They really nailed the cocktail servers with that one.The second skit that I choose to be the best on this DVD, is the one where Kattan is getting set up on a date with \"twins.\"  What's so hilarious about it is the fact that the twins turn out to be siamese twins, and \"his\" twin is, as his character says. \"not finished baking yet.\"You have to watch the DVD.  Even if it can only briefly lift you from the existance you are stuck in, it's worth it for a moments escape."],["Bought this video for my daughter for Christmas last year. We were always big SNL fans. Especially the older 80's ones. She loves it!"],["I was actually surprised to see how funny this one was. I loved Kattan in several skits i saw him on tv, and as a huge fan of SNL, decided to get it anyway. This Best of is probably one of the best ones I've seen!

We had no idea what it was about. It turns out, it was one of the best things I've ever done. It has become my favorite movie of all time.

The plot is predictable, and although Graham's performance is worthy, the rest of the movie is sluggish.

Good characters.  I Recommend highly.  Would like to see more of this genre available at these low prices"],["Director Nisha Ganatra and writer Tassie Cameron seem to have most of their experience in TV movies so this little slice of the industry is a change for them.  Would that it were wholly successful because it seems as though both had a fine idea for something to say but just didn't know how to make it work. And again, blame the PR folks for making a cover for the DVD that not only seems silly, it has little to do with the story inside.Pippa McGee (Heather Graham) is a travel writer, a hedonist, and an independent woman who avoids relationships like the plague.  The film starts with a goofus dash for a wedding in which she is once again a bridesmaid on the run.  After the ceremony she jokes with her best friend Lulu (Sandra Oh) who is equally against long term relationships beyond a quick shag, and she also meets one Ian (David Sutcliffe - Under the Tuscan Sun, Testosterone, Happy Endings etc), a handsome if shy young man who though attracted to Pippa, sees her as dangerous territory.Pippa soon discovers that her father Malcolm McGee (Bruce Gray), a wealthy successful owner of a magazine conglomerate, is ill, has a heart attack, and though the father and daughter have had a negligible relationship, Pippa offers her help.  Of course, her assignment is to be editor of 'Wedding Bells' magazine her departed mother started, and Pippa takes on the epitome of everything she loathes about relationships and marriage and tries to make a go of it.  She discovers that Ian is her father's vice president and thus in charge of her new and loathed assignment.  Pippa partners with the handsome magazine photographer Hemingway Jones (Taye Diggs), has a fling, and becomes close friends and partners in an attempt to change the look of the wedding magazine.  There are far too many subplots to discuss, but suffice it to say that changes occur in the personalities of everyone involved and the ending, while entirely predictable, has enough humor and warmth to make a good evening out of a shaky story.Heather Graham handles her 'challengingly bad' role with great aplomb: she is a delight to watch. The remainder of the cast does their best with the lines they're given. This is a bit of fluff, aimed at the 'chick flick' devotees, but it has its moments.

Also tied to this temporary new job is Ian Gray (played by David Sutcliffe), her father's uptight (and charming and handsome) VP.

The plot and the acting was just horrible."],["The first half of the movie felt like a waste of time to watch because of the editing. It was like half the scenes had no beginning, they were just a middle and an end. I couldn't follow what was going on as it happened, I had to work it out afterwards, and some of the time I couldn't at all. It's not like there were a lot of complexities that were vital to the central plot, but I still want to understand details, as I assume there must be some point to them. The choppy editing is the overriding problem that makes me wish I never bothered with the movie.As for what I could follow of the story, in the first half we're seemingly led to admire Pippa's independent spirit, then when we're invested in that character it's revealed as a symptom of her fear of intimacy.We're supposed to believe that she has some kind of relationship with Taye Diggs' character, and be emotionally invested in the outcome, when he's had a total of like 1 minute of screen time, the first scene where they meet, and the second when she inexplicably shows up at his apartment, a typical example of the starting a scene in the middle thing I mentioned earlier.The it's-happy-because-they're-together/it's-sad-because-they're-not-together moments were more forced, contextless and unearned than in the vast majority of romantic comedies, and completely at odds with the overall more vague tone of the film.Maybe I just took too logical of an approach to a movie that is supposed to work on a primarily emotional level, but even the emotional wavelength on which the film attempts to draw you in doesn't seem to have much consistency. It's kinda like it started out as a Peaches song, then became Liz Phair, then finally became Dido."],["Overall a cute and fun romantic comedy movie. Not a movie i'd recommend if you're expecting deep intellectual messages and life change.The story follows a young free spirit woman, who takes over, as Editor, a wedding magazine for her father who has fallen ill. Oh, right, and she doesn't believe in marriage or weddings! So she has to undergo some internal digging, with herself and a touch of soul scrubbing to heal her own issues and stand up to her Dad as well, who is a bit of a tyrant. She ends up falling into interest with her father's V.P. who is there to help guide through.Good acting, decent story, loved her BFF, cute love story. Nothing Oscar winning here, to be sure.

His characters are top rate and makes you laugh with him and at his endearing facial gestures.Can't wait to see him in the movies and as the star of his own TV show.C'mon Hollywood - find a vehicle for this great one."],["Jon Lovitz first came on the show during the notorious 1985 season, which had an incredible accumulation of acting talent (Robert Downey Jr., Joan Cusack, Anthony Michael Hall, and Randy Quaid, to name a few) but that didn't necessarily apply to sketch comedy. Lovitz, though, shined, as did Dennis Miller and Nora Dunn, and they were the only three to make it to the next year. For the next half-decade he would prove to be a versatile comic diva, bringing a wide variety of characters to the show, including the Pathological Liar (should be self-explanatory); the prince of darkness, Mephistopheles (who seemed to wind up being sued on the People's Court far more often than one might expect); Michael Dukakis (and uncannily, too), and others. Lovitz finally gets his long-overdue recognition with this DVD, and I'm grateful, since he is probably the most underrated performer ever to be on the show. At least with this DVD, SNL is moving back toward its roots, which is a positive direction since it has such history. Anyway, bottom line, this is a great DVD to have."],["not worth the $10.00. just wasn't funny as Id thought it be.I grow up on 1974-1985 SNL. But never laughed once watching Lovitz dvd."],["To paraphrase a previous review, Jon Lovitz joined the cast in the notorious 1985-86 season. The show was in a bind a this point. The previous 1984 season (the last under Dick Ebersol's reign as execuitve producer) was a big hit thanks to a largely all star cast including Billy Crystal and Martin Short. Lorne Michaels returned as the show's driving force this year, and began searching for raw talrnt to bring the sho back to life. The cast he found was a large assortment of future stars, including Joan Cusack, Robert Downey Jr., Randy Quaid, Anthony Michael Hall, Lovitz, Dennis Miller and Nora Dunn. Despite a wide range of talent, the cast didn't work out, and the show was actually cancelled at one point during the summer of 1986. However, Lorne beged for another chance and did what is known in tv as an overhaul, he fired the majority of the cast but kept three promising performers: Dennis Miller, Nora Dunn and Lovitz.Now, 20 years after joining the cast, Jon Lovitz has finally got his own best of. Although most of the best of's leave SNL fans divided, this dvd is actually a pretty accurate sampling of his work on the show.To give a brief overview, this dvd gives us sketches featuring all of Lovitz's most popular charcters, including Tonto, Master Thespian, Mephistophilles (the devil incarnate) and the unforgettable Tommy Flannagan, Pathalogical Liar. There are also a few impressions thrown in, including a hysterical Harvey Fierstein bit that had me in stitches. There is also a montage featuring snippets of some other memorable impressions, such as Michael Dukakis (and as one reviewer mentioned, dead on), David Crosby and Queen Elizabeth. There are some sketches that I didn't like such (I could've done without \"Tales Of Ribaldry\" and especially the one with John Malcovich), but otherwise, this is a really great dvd.The bonus materials are also very good. I didn't watch the dress sketch yet, but it looks pretty good, something about WWII. His Conan appearance is hilarious, the photo gallery a standard bonus on all best of's and his dress rehearsal is a little boring but shows his talent in progress.Overall, this is a very well done best of for Mr. Lovitz. It's nice to see the show honoring its legends from long ago."],["This DVD is a wonderful hour of television which documents the lost and exquisite program that Saturday Night Live once was. The finest segment here is Lovitz's performance as Mephistophiles on an imaginary People's Court. Phil Hartman plays an amazing Judge Wapner while Jan Hooks is a scintillating piece of rural refuse. Actually, I replayed the People's Court bit three times because it happens to be in my Top 5 SNL moments ever. The rest of the DVD is good and includes his great rendition of the guy in the Dunkin Donuts commercials from two decades ago.

However, even though I had loved Jon Lovitz in his movies like Rat Race and on his guest spots for The Simpsons, I never knew how great he was on SNL. I own 5 SNL DVDs, and this one is my favorite now. Lovitz brings so many memorable characters to the table that it's amazing I never knew about them. There's his court case as the Devil (or Mr. Mephistopheles); his Weekend Update visits as Frenchie, Annoying Man, and as himself, instructing people to get to know him (Donald Trump and Queen Elizabeth did so and look at them now!); the Liar; Hanukkah Harry; the lesser beast to Phil Hartman's beast at the drive-in; the Dunkin Donuts guy; the girl watchers with Tom Hanks (\"Hello... and goodbye\"); his impersonations of Michael Dukakis, Harvey Feirstein, and others; and a few Hollywood spoofs with Phil Hartman.With all these great skits, how could you not want this DVD?

His troupe was castigated as poor in comparison to what had happened the season before, and, as a result, he sank with the ship (as it were).At last we have a chance to see what a genius he was.  One thing I really appreciated about this DVD was the inclusion of his \"forties\" productions.  I share Jon's love for the period, and his ability to slip into a forties smoking jacket went far beyond \"the Master Thespian.\"And don't get me started about the Pathological Liar...yeah, that's the ticket.I'm hoping to see more of Jon in the future;  he was pretty much wasted in \"Rat Race\" and while I like his cartoon voice work, it's his physical comedy that adds so much."],["There is way more funny ones than just that,but the time to make the donuts sketch is my favorite on the dvd.

I usually wait awhile to get these for 10 bucks or less, but as was the case with the Will Ferrel/Jimmy Fallon dvd's, paying full price(about 15 bucks) for this right away(released as of 6/7/05) is not a bad thing.  I'm not a huge Jon Lovitz fan, but he did have some very funny bits/characters, and he was always a solid performer that was counted on to help carry the show every week(and he would deliver too).  I'm not here to review or re-cap all the sketches, too lazy for that.  Besides, either you enjoyed Lovitz or you didn't, and some sketches are better than others(we all know every collection is a hit-or-miss affair as to the selection of sketches that made the cut or not); and even with his fans, there will always be debate as to which bits better represented his talents.  So i'll just tell you why this is a particularly good edition in the series.A. it runs about 94 minutes.  some in the series barely break 60 min!  so you're getting a decent dose of quantity here(quality i'll leave up to SNL/Lovitz fans to dissect themselves)B. the extras are plenty, unlike some other bare bones releases in the series.  they include:* audition: good thing i'm not a talent scout, cause i wouldn't have hired Lovitz based on his audition lol.  it's fairly brief, another snl alumni shows up(and does nothing!), and it has a tie-in to the dress rehearsal....* photo gallery: some pics of mr. Lovitz, also fairly brief.* dress rehearsal: a decent sketch(never before seen apparently) that also has Leslie Nielson(Police Squad/Naked Gun fame) in it.  it's a WW2 bit that has some lines you'll recognize from his auditon.* tv appearance: from the Conan O'Brian show, this is pretty good as well. there's only one segment(in its entirety it seems) unfortunatley. i say that only because i've seen him on Conan quite a bit and this isn't the best one. but it does include his usual rants at Conan's expense.* audio commentary: my favorite extra.  having him contribute this track really adds to the enjoyment. listening to him reminisce in the commentary is fun and informative and really adds an extra dimension to the disc.  Highly recommended if you enjoy SNL, Jon Lovitz, this 'best of' series, comedy in general, or good value in your dvd's."],["I am a huge SNL fan.

When young Katie moves with her family to Havana, Cuba, she is at first, very hesitant about the country. Katie is initially quite distant and refuses to take advantage of the country and its beautiful culture until she meets an amazing young man named Javier.Javier is a young Cuban waiter who initially helps her find her way around. Javier becomes friends with her and later sees how she is intrigued by the style of dancing in Cuba. He then decides to help her learn the moves and the two's chemistry continues to build as their moves improve and are synchronized to the music. Javier is later fired from his job and desperately needs money to support his family. Luckily, a new Latin dance contest is going to be held with a decent amount of money offered as a prize. Katey decides to enter the contest with Javier in hope of winning the money and to help out her new love and his family. The movie takes a new twist when history is written when Castro's revolution interferes with the two love birds' plans and desires.This movie is ultimately a great dance movie and is great for any person who loved the first Dirty Dancing or the art of dancing in general. The movie has a very sexy and sultry feel and although the ending seems abrupt, you'll want to watch it more than once! The actor, Diego Lunes, who plays Javier, has a smooth character whose moves are flawless and whose personality and humor keep all eyes on him. Katey, played by Romolo Garaj, is the typical teenage character that goes through some changes yet meeting Javier makes her reach self actualization and realize her passion for dancing."],["Amazing Story based on real events that happened over fifty years  ago  during political chaos in Cuba has little connection to the Dirty Dancing masterpiece of the 1980s, except for the name and a certain extended cameo appearance by one of the original film's stars, that is.HAVANA NIGHTS tells a  compelling story of a young girl forced to relocate to Cuba when her father gets a job over there and ends up meeting a local boy who teaches her how to tap into her spiritual side by self expression in the form of dancing. Her parents of course are portrayed as old fuddie duddies at first but eventually come to realise their daughter is old enough to choose what she wants out of life, and inevitably she and the boy fall in love.Entering a dance competition,  the two  take to the floor and astound  just about everyone present.But before  the young dancers are able to  fully  embrace the passion required for the moves in the contest, some necessary help is gained  by a certain dance instructor who will no doubt be very familiar to just about every female on the planet, and movie lovers everywhere.  Patrick Swayze appears for several scenes and provides rather memorable moments that really add to the overall enjoyment of the story, making this an amazing cinematic experiece that will take your breath away! Also his dance partner in the first scene at the dance studio is in reality the woman whose life this film is based on. This only makes this movie rate even higher for all the cleverness that comes out of it.I got this DVD  this morning as a Christmas gift from my parents and just now finished it and sat down to write this review, so you know it is that good. Also of note is the song you hear at the end of the film when the young lovers have their last dance. It is called \"Hips Don't Lie\" and is by Shakira, and available on her most recent release.Order HAVANA NIGHTS today and have a very  Merry Christmas!! I know I sure will!"],["I started watching this movie but did not finish it.  I was bored with the whole story line.  The original Dirty Dancing was much better."],["This movie starts out tame to introduce our main character Katey, then subtly introduces Javier.  After our introductions it moves past that to introduce the wonderful latin dancing.  The dancing in this movie really gives a great look on latin dancing.  I really enjoyed the fact that they introduced what was going on during 1958-1959 in cuba. If they would have left the politics out we as audiences would be lost as to what the fuss is all about with Katey being in love with a cuban, Javier and why the cubans were being prosecuted for doing their thing and being as free as the Americans.  The actor and actress did a great job at performing and truly looked in love throughout the movie.  I hope to see more of them.  Diego Luna was very hot in this movie and could really dance.  This movie was truly impressive and has inspired me to look into more about cuban history and latin dancing. I've started taking ballroom dancing because of this movie.... I hope you all enjoy this movie as much as i did! It is a great movie with alot to enjoy."],["just what I ordered.  Enjoy watching the movie and will have for a long time.  thanks.  Amazon - shorten how long feedback should be then maybe you will get more."],["I am a fan of originals but i must say i loved this one more than the first one (kind of)."],["The only good things about this movie were the lead actors and the dancing.  The writing was horrible and the background story was annoying.  Despite all of this, I will buy the DVD.  Im a sucker for sequel/series and it was a cute movie as long as you have no expectations past cute leads and fun dancing.  The soundtrack is great, not very fitting to time/place of the film, but its got some good dancin music."],["I loved 'Dirty Dancing Havana Nights'! I've seen the original 'Dirty Dancing' a few times and this one is just as great!The story is about a young high school girl(Katie) who moves with her family to Cuba in the late 1950's just before the revolution that put Castro in power(her father's job sends them there). She is bookish and shy.At the hotel where they are staying, she meets a young Cuban waiter with whom she strikes an immediate friendship. Javier(the waiter) is different from other young people she knows and he encourages her to come out of her shyness and be more free and open with herself.When her friend and sister see the two of them together, they alert the hotel staff and he immediately loses his job for being with her. Katie encourages Javier to enter a latin dance contest with her for the chance at some much needed cash that will be given to the winners. Javier happens to dance like a dream and Katie's family comes from a dance background as well. She feels that with enough practice together, they have a really good chance at winning. Naturally, during the course of practice and performing the two fall sweetly in love and awaken deep feelings in each other.Diego Luna and Romola Gerai star as the young couple and they are perfectly matched!  This was great casting! They have great chemistry and their dancing is fabulous!  Diego Luna is gorgeous! What a sexy smile!The music is incredible and watching 'Havana Nights' made me want to learn to dance! The soundtrack is definitely worth it! 'Dance Like This' is my favorite track, but I love all the songs! I could watch this one over and over!This was a great production. The costumes, sets, location! All super!'Dirty Dancing Havana Nights' is great. Definitely worth seeing more than once!"],["I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO AMAZING MOVIE NEVER GETS OLD YOU SHOULD WACH IT IF U HAVEN'T SO ROMANTIC  LOVE IT"],["Its not the best, but really good movie, very musical and lot of dance. I wish there more views of Havana, because all movie looks like made in one  block... well, cant change it."],["Different take on a dancing classic. Takes place before the Cuban revolution so it's interesting to see some history incorporated (but don't expect anything too deep). Great music and dancing. Diego Luna is great in his role!"],["I knew it wouldn't be as good as the original, but I don't think it is as bad as it has been made out to be, particularly the dancing. From what I could see of the actors, they looked really good. Unfortunately, the camera almost always shot them from the waist up so you couldn't really feel the dance or even know if they weren't messing up. The only thing you could make out was whether they were supposed to be dirty or ballroom dancing. In fact, the only dance I could see clearly, and thus the most riveting, was the recreation of the original dirty dance with the Patrick Swayze cameo. Even when the actors finally get to their big routine you don't get to see much of it due to camera angles and the plot twist. I only harp on the dancing aspects because I am sure many other people will be interested in this movie, as I was, for dancing. The dancing is good but you see so little of it is not very inspiring.In fact, it didn't really feel like a dancing movie. The dancing almost seemed to be a subplot to the Cuban revolution theme. The themes of the  different social classes and the revolution felt trite though. It didn't seem to fit in the movie too fluidly and it was not dealt with in depth.Other detractions of the movie were the simplictic language used, the youthful pubescent look of the leading man which made it hard to look at him dirty dance without feeling uncomfortable, and the inconsistent texture of the movie. What I mean by texture is nothing that really detracts from the plot, just little things which seem implausible. I found it hard to believe this rich, protective, socialite family would, upon discovering their young, high school daughter's romantic relationship with a lower class Cuban would allow her to spend entire nights away from the family in revolutionary Cuba.On a more positive note, the visual look of the movie made it a treat for the eyes. The colors and scenery were delectable. The music was a pleasure to hear. And although the dialogue is simple, it is pleasantly interspersed with Spanish language (which is refreshing after seeing many movies set in other countries where not only do the main characters not speak the language, but have no accent!).Overall, the movie is not hard to watch. It is rather pleasant. However it is not exactly a must-see and of course it does not compare to Dirty Dancing."],["this movie was freaking awesome it took me back to the time when the revolution was going on in Cuba.....the whites went to Cuba don't ask me why!!! but anyhow the best part was seeing Patrick Swayze when he was at the ripe age of 80!!! so the movie pretty much is racist because they don't like whites and the whites don't like Cubans... i mean the ending was the best part not the credits well part of it but also that she didn't care if she was going to get an education!!! i mean what is the most important education or being the queen of some club????  the only thing that would spice up this movie is if someone said \"nobody puts baby in the corner\"..."],["love this movie! Dancing, culture, and a love story all in one. I would reccommend this to anyone especially the women out there"],["Dirty Dancing Havana Nights is a movie that combines culture and dancing to create a distinct atmosphere. When I first saw this movie, I fell in love with it instantly. I think the actors did an amazing job despite the fact that the dialog was a bit corny.  The movie talks about two teenagers falling in love. This takes place in Havana Cuba in the 1950's right before the Cuban revolution.The soundtrack in this movie truly ROCKS! All songs were very well selected and the actors danced amazingly. Javier (Diego Luna) and Katey (Romola Garai) shared unbelievable chemistry which made the movie more enjoyable. They performed the sexiest dance moves I have ever seen.Although the plot is very similar to the first Dirty Dancing movie, it's worth to watch. The movie is certainly charming and exciting. You will not regret buying it. Plus you can always learn a few Spanish words while watching it =)"],["I sincerely thing that this movie is WAY better than the first one.  I tried to watch the first one, and I was just bored throughout the first 20 minutes I could get through. Now, for Havana Nights, I know the plot isn't very well written and the script has some pretty corny dialogue, but the dancing makes up for it big time. I love the sensual feel of this movie, and it could partly be because I'm Hispanic and LOVE the way Hispanic's dance. Diego and Romola have amazing chemistry, overall, I think that it's a great film that makes you want to dance once you finish watching it."],["Diego Luna is great not sure I enjoyed Romola Garai (she is not Jennifer Grey). Enjoyed Patrick Swazye cameo. It's enjoyable."],["I didn't think I would like this one better than the original. The original is a classic-- the perfect 80s movie, but the new one is so much more sensual and emotional. My only complaint is that it ended much too quickly, without much closure for the audience, but otherwise this film is a joy to watch.Katie (Romola Garai) has just moved to pre-revolution Cuba. She's a total bookworm, but when she meets hotel waiter Javier (the marvelous Diego Luna) she's completely swept away. The basic story follows that of the original-- she doesn't know how to &quot;feel&quot; the music, her parents dissaprove of the guy she likes, preferring her to date the guy she hates.The cinematography is impressive, and the colors are amazing-- lots of reds and oranges. It's so picturesque. The performances were great, the dancing was wonderful (although I don't think the dancing was necessarily dirty, it was much more beautiful and sensual than the dancing in the original). I really like that Patrick Swayze makes an appearance as a dance instructor. His limited screen time is awesome.Definitely check this one out. If your a fan of the original, don't snub this one, you may like it better. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"],["I like Diego Luna, which was my main reason for buying this film, I could not find it on Netflix, etc....... Obviously it isn't comparable to the original....... but has a similar plot. Disc came in good condition, but there was no cover art in the dvd case (blahhhh)"],["It made me want to go out and learn how to dance. Well, I had wanted to already, but still."],["This movie was just okay to me.  I wasn't as interested in this one as I was the first.  Granted, the cast was easy on the eyes in this film, but it just lacked the excellence of the first.  To me, there is no touching a classic, so I guess that is to be expected.  The second usually isn't as good as the first, that is the case here.  I would suggest renting this, it's worth at least a watch.  Patrick Swayze is back in this one, a small part."],["The overall movie kept me interested but really it was kind of dumb. If you really like dancing it is tolerable"],["The dancing was good but they could have had more of it.  The love story was barely warm.  Romanticizing a failed revolution which continues to commit human rights violations against it's own people is really sad, even for a fantasy film.  Batista was bad but Castro has been way worse.  THE ENDING WAS TOTALLY DISHONEST IN A HISTORICAL SENSE, AS CASTRO'S REVOLUTION HAS DONE NOTHING BUT ENSLAVE, KILL & TORTURE THE CUBAN PEOPLE.  If you can set aside the dishonesty & illogical romanticizing of the failed revolution, the film is just ok.  The original Dirty Dancing was WAY BETTER."],["The background story was interesting. You rarely see movies set in pre-Castro Cuba. Sadly, it didn't have the same impact that the original movie had."],["This is one of my all time favorite movies! I was so happy when I found it on here but my husband, not so much lol. I watch it all the time! Great price for a new movie."],["I loved it! Just a nice enjoyable movie with great dancing and a good story line. Somewhat predictable at times but I still loved it!"],["One of the best movies I have ever seen.  I think I have almost wore out my DVD I play it so much.  The dancing is great!  It will make you want to take salsa lessons.  I also love the underlying plot of learning people before judging them and to watch where you step as someone's toes are always there.  I had had heard how terrible this movie was and so forth but I can say I think I like it better than the first.  I love the first one but this one the music gets you moving and the romance between the two main characters is intense.  I also loved the DANCING!  They are great!  The part with the movie is one of my favorite scenes it is romantic but not trashy.  There is intense love for one another and that acting is superb as you get caught up in each one of the characters!  If you watch this movie and enjoy the music the soundtrack is worth buying!  The music is actually from the movie!"],["Very fast delivery despite Christmas rush.  Thank you Amazon for always being there for me."],["Yeah first of all I must say DD havana nights is a great movie.  That part were they were in havana dancing and it was at night that was great.  The night time in Havana is pretty cool not to mention the dirty dancing. The only thing I did not understand is why they did not include the deleted scene with Hyman Roth.  Pat Swayze drops by after he was done dancing and getting a face lift to eat some cake with Hyman Roth.  Pretty neat scene really."],["I liked the first Dirty Dancing movie, so when my husband raved about this one, I bought it instead of renting it first. It was a disappointment across the board, with just a couple of bright spots. The interaction between the girl and her father was touching. The acting by the two young stars was in character, but the script was not up to par and the rest of the actors were handicapped by the lines and situations they were required to deliver. It was shocking to see Patrick Swayze looking so old in this film. It didn't do him or the film justice. He would have been better off in a serious role rather than the bit player he was here.The scriptwriter tried to do too many things in this film and as a consequence, accomplished none of them. The acting, the dancing, and the overall production were disappointing, to say the least. None of it was credible. I cannot understand anyone getting excited by this film, but that's just me and my tastes. The first \"Dirty Dancing\" film drew me in and caused me to care about the characters and what happened to them. I kept waiting for this to happen with this film, but it just never got there."],["LOVE this movie. Every time I watch it, I just want to start dancing dirty with a saucy Latino! :)"],["It's understandable that any follow-up to a cult classic such as \"Dirty Dancing\" will be ripped apart regardless of its actual performance.  That's because viewers step into the movie with a mindset of preconceived notions and expectations.  I must admit that I was one of those viewers, avoiding this film at all costs, until this past weekend.That's when I entered the world of \"Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights\" and fell in love with what I saw.  I honestly feel as if this movie has some of the sexiest dance scenes I've seen, and the art direction is simply fabulous.  The costumes and hairstyling are also very well done.  Although mainstream American  audiences will not recognize most of the cast members, Diego Luna puts on an amazing act as Javier Suarez, an intelligent, enticing waiter at a Cuban resort.  Jonathan Jackson's performance as a slick badboy is a little unconvincing, but then again, many of the film's characters go underdeveloped.Nonetheless, I'd still recommend \"DD:HN\" just for the sake of fun.  It's perfect for a night in with the girls or even for spending time with a significant other.  If you  have already seen it and think it's terrible, try watching it for similarities with its predecessor and come to appreciate the captivating uniqueness that is \"Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights.\" :)"],["The new Dirty Dancing wants to be the the first. Same scenario, same kinds of scene (dancing in the water)It's DD except with a spanish accent. The actors are ok, nice to look at, but there's really nothing there. No funny moments like in the original. I was expecting more and was disappointed."],["Poorly done - tried to copy Dirty Dancing too much - poor acting - slow start - didn't even finish it"],["I enjoyed it as much as the original! Most remakes aren't as good but this one I keep watching over and over!"],["This movie was actually quite good. When I first found out that they were doing a second Dirty Dancing my first instinct was NO! Absolutely NOT! So many times when film makers toy with older movies they never seem to come out right. For example Disney and the many sequels they torture us with. However, when I sat down and watched the movie I LOVED it! It got me really excited about dancing just as the first version had. I actually went to see the movie twice when it was in theaters. Something I had never really done before. The only reason I give it four stars is because I'm not that happy with the girl they chose to play Katie who was the Protagonist in the movie. Most of the time she was fine but sometimes I felt that she could have done a better job with some of her lines. Also there was the matter of the way Katie and her dance partner Javier express their feelings to each other. There really isn't a reckoning point. There are several points in the movie where I thought, \"Ok this is it. They're going to kiss each other and realize each others affections.\" But it never really came that way. The first time we see them kiss is on the dance floor as the result of Javier's spontaneity. Then suddenly the next night they sleep with each other. It happens in a lot the same way in the first movie. If they were attempting to be more true to reality they missed the mark because I don't know if that is really something that would happen. A shy straight laced innocent virgin like Katie just hopping into his arms for one night. Then again, maybe that's the power of love..."],["This movie was set in Havana, Cuba and so it has a different feel than the original Dirty Dancing but I liked it (not as much as the first one though)."],["Maybe it is me...or I am just crazy...but personally, I like the orignial DD better than this installment.  Yes, it had some decent music, but not the best.  The original had better music, just my opinion.  Ok, for the story...the story of the main characters is very interesting, and did keep my interest somewhat.  I found that the story was a bit draggy, but the ending was something to be desired.  The film failed to really wrap things up, and kinda left ppl hanging in the end. As for the actors overall performance in this film, everyone did a good job, but no one really stood out in the crowd for me. Good dancing, to be had by all, but overall this movie could have been a bit better, hence the 3 stars!"],["I absolutely loved this movie!

Patrick Swayze has a small part and it was wonderful to remember such a fabulous dancer."],["This movie was great mainly because of the sensuality. Dirty dancing-1987 wasn't really as sensual as the Spanish version. Havana nights shows the tango's style and sexuality. You have to be close with another person and experience it together. I would reccomend it to people who like Latin dance or love stories even predictable ones. Even though it's a boy meets girl story it can be pretty unpredictable at parts. This is mainly because it was an uneasy time in Cuba. 4 stars."],["Pretty predictable if you watched the first Dirty Dancing.  Still some good dancing in this one and it was good for a movie with next to no know actors in it.

Bad."],["Seeing this movie makes me want to learn salsa dancing.  It is such a sensual and exotic dance that liberates the mind and the soul.  The best way to learn salsa would either be in person at the clubs or at home with dance instructional DVD's.

I've always sort of had a place in my heart for Latin music, dancing, and a fascination with other cultures. I thought that a new version might give the '80s original new life. I loved every moment of the film.Yes, some of the dialogue was corny, and yes, some of the plot was lame. But in light of these vices, I found the performances from the two leads excellent!

The music(latin flavor)and location is different from the first, as is the story line, but I was sold at the first dance routine. Music and dancing has a way of making peoples lives richer, that is what this movie showed, and that was my take away, just as in the original. Music and dancing is a universal expression of emotions and feelings that don't always translate well with words no matter what the language is!

The story is flaccid and all too predictable, and the use of the Cuban Revolution in the background is forced, awkward and unbelievable.  It's just ridiculous to cast Luna in the role of a budding underground revolutionary.  The ending, with the two puppy lovers making love and then gleefully saying goodbye, is a total insult to the audience.Ok, so we probably didn't watch the movie for the silly plot or the unbalanced romance.  But unlike the original Dirty Dancing, which had good acting and good dancing to make it into a classic, this one lacks these sorely, too.  Nobody in this movie can really act, and the dancing feels empty and falls short of my modest expectations.  Where's the energy?  Where's the rhythm?  Where's the art?  None of those.

Patrick Swayze was the only redeeming factor for the 4 mins or so he was in the movie.Granted, some of the dancing was good but the girls parents, supposedly ex-champions, couldn't even dance.

Diego Luna and Romola Garai make a terrific couple and both have enough stature to bring this little soap opera up to higher aspirations.  Set against the end of Batista's rule over Cuba and the rise of Castro, the background of Cuban exoticism adds to this coming together of a Cuban lad and an American lass on the dance floors of Cuban nightclubs and eventual Latin Dancing competition.  The story may be slight, but the cast is genuine and endearing and there is plenty of very beautiful and sensuous dancing to brighten up the plot.  Worth your time for that laid back summer evening."],["Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I have seen it 2x in the last 3 days. Diego Luna is a great actor besides the fact that he is very hot! He's my new fav actor. Romola Garai did a good job on this film.  Their chemistry on screen is great and I am surprised that neither of them had any previous dancing experience and had to learn all of it. They did a great job! There are a couple lines that disrupted the intimate scenes, but overall it was a fantastic movie! Go see it if you haven't already but make sure you don't have expectations. It is nothing like the original. It's my new fav movie and I can't wait until it comes out on DVD!"],["The two main characters in this movie are played by Diego Luna and Romola Garai. (Patrick Swayze also makes a few small appearances in this film as a middle-aged hotel dance instructor who winds up helping the young heroine work through her dancing fears in regards to letting her male partner \"lead\" her.)Both Diego and Romola create very believable and engaging characters on-screen.The plot is quite interesting, involving a bit more depth than the original Dirty Dancing movie of the late 80's. It is set in Havana, Cuba, near the end of the Cuban revolution to overthrow the then-current president, Batista, and to afterwards set Fidel Castro in the prominent position of leadership.The male protagonist is a native Cuban pool boy, who comes from a very poor family, and is trying to support not just himself, but his whole family - including a young male child that one of his elder brother's ex-girlfriends dropped off prior to the time when the movie begins.The female protagonist is a scholarly American girl, temporarily living in Havana with her mother, father, and younger sister, until she can finish the 2nd half of her senior year of high school, and then head back to the States for college.In the beginning of the movie, the female lead is not pleased with having to move to Cuba because of her father's job promotion, but she very maturely apologizes in the first quarter of the film to her father for her initially surly attitude.One of the commendable things regarding this movie is that the characters do not fall into completely stereotypical types. There is a refreshing element of un-expectability in how they do what they do, what they say, and their non-verbal expressions of what they think. The English actress Romola, in particular, is quite clearly skilled at her line of work. Any of the characters in this movie could have been portrayed by the actor or actress playing them in a cliched manner. However, I was very pleased that I rarely felt during the film that any of the scenes were at all cheesy. The movie was not perfect, by any means, but it was well-made, and the care and time put into its creation is evident.I would definitely recommend this movie for someone wanting to watch any of these types of films: the romantic, teen, dancing, or feel-good variety.If you are the sort of person who prefers watching movies along the more serious lines of \"The King's Speech,\" (starring Colin Firth), then this much more light-hearted film is probably not for you.If, however, you want to view a positive movie purely for entertainment's sake, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend watching \"Dirty Dancing - Havana Nights.\"An interesting footnote I would like to add is that the plot was derived from one woman's real-life experiences in Cuba, which were similar to those of the character Katie in the film.Another intriguing tid-bit is that the actor who plays the Cuban older brother is from a natively Cuban family, and truly grew up in Cuba through his pre-teen years until his family moved to Florida. The actor's father was actually present the night the revolution over-threw President Batista in favor Fidel Castro, which is the exact same evening that is re-portrayed in this movie.All in all, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this film, and by how many different aspects of it I found interesting or admired.  :)"],["Good movie, but still like the original better."],["I was really hoping to enjoy this movie, really, I was.  It was just so lame.  The acting WAS horrible...it seemed forced among all actors.  Their was NO chemistry between the main characters.  Even the cameo with Patrick Swayze was ridiculous!

Ugh..maybe you should see it just to say you did, but rent it first before wasting your money on poor acting.BTW, if you are seeing it to see Swayze, he LOOKS horrible.

She doesn't have much social experience, but she knows she likes this guy better than the son of her dad's boss. She signs up for a dance competition with the Cuban guy, and then comes a romance that you've probably seen in several movies before and after this one.This was a pretty good movie with great dancing, and the story is nice as well. And though I like the music, it didn't really convince me it was from the 1950s. The songs in the background were much like the songs of today. I think the story writers wanted to set the film during the Cuban Revolution era so that it'll add to the drama, but they forgot to set everything else (i.e. the soundtrack) to the same time period.

I really love this movie.I absolutely recommended this!I will buy some more movies, great experience"],["I understand that Dirty Dancing movies aren't going to be exactly like Citizen Kain.  But when you think about the premise, the culture and classist clash of American vs. Cuban dancing, sexuality, and budding romance set during the backdrop of the Revolution, the movie sounds quite promising.  I mean, when I heard the premise I thought \"This movie was MADE for me,\" because it has Cuban history and politics, awesome dancing (or so I assumed it would, due to its predecessor,) and, come on, the main character has the same name as me.  But I should have realized then that a good premise does not necessarily lead to a good, or even adequate, execution.I won't summarize the movie as so many others do; if you want a synopsis, look to their reviews.  I WILL point out what exactly I found so lacking about it, and why I do not feel it was that good of a movie, even when one considers that it's ultimately just a dance movie.  But again one must remember that it was their decision to involve politics in the movie, and in doing so they made themselves fair game--I do not believe in just using a deep political situation just to make a story line seem a little deeper; if it is not handled properly, it is insulting.First off, the romance.  Diego Luna and Romola Garai had definite chemistry, and it is so disappointing when you realize that the movie did not capitalize upon this, and all you're going to see in addition to some very sexually charged dancing is a few hurried onscreen kisses and an implied sex scene.  Given their chemistry and the buildup of their relationship, their first kiss could have been so much better, instead of just snuck in during a dance routine--it was so quick I spent many minutes wondering if I had really seen it or not.  However, to me chemistry is not the only thing required in an on-screen relationship, and I have no idea to this minute why Javier and Katey fell in love with each other.  Katey's personality was developed in the movie sense (she likes classic literature, is a bookworm and rather progressive for her time) and Javier was clearly the \"will do anything for his family and feels that Cuba is in need of a change\" but I don't really know how those two fit together.  Aside from the sexual attraction component, I have no idea what exactly they saw in each other to make their relationship anything more than \"He was hot, she was pretty, and she felt sorry for him.\"  Some might argue that Katey was merely attracted to the intensity and freedom of the Cuban lifestyle embodied by Javier, but I ask you: the movie was founded upon the idea of a romance, and what the heck kind of relationship is that?I would also like to add that the Spanish conversations WITHOUT subtitles were incredibly rude to the audience.  I do speak Spanish, but I could not make much sense of the slurred words and to this day I am wondering what exactly Javier and his brother said to each other after the Revolution broke out.  Maybe they figured that the audience would not care (pfft, what are politics compared to SALSA DANCING,) but I cared.And now, the historical components.  I will not get into the anachronisms--such as Katey's parents' attitude towards her staying nights with a boy they don't know, and that even Cuba in the 50's could not have been that unrestrained--as there are many who could do that better justice than I (apparently the style of dancing in the movie was unlike what was popular in Cuba at the time.)  After all, it is only a dance movie.  I can ignore that stuff.  But when the movie brings the history to ME I cannot ignore it, and I further dislike it when movie directors assume that their audience is completely ignorant of certain aspects of history and will just assume that \"Man, that Batista guy was a jerk; he didn't allow dancing.  Hopefully life will be better under this new regime!  Who'd they say it was, some guy by the name of Fidel Something-or-Another?\" (I am exaggerating; at least I hope that no one is that ignorant.)And here we get to the backdrop of the story, Revolutionary Cuba.  First off, Batista's regime wasn't really shown to be that bad; aside from the story involving Javier's father, it might as well have been that town in Footloose (perhaps a little more violent.)  It was like Dictatorship Lite.  After Havana falls to Castro and co., the Cubans act happy (which is understandable) but things are otherwise pretty calm, which one cannot imagine is really likely in such a situation.And then we get to the ending.  Katey asks Javier to come to America with her.  In a move which my sister has deemed the \"stupidest decision in a movie ever,\" Javier refuses, saying that he has to stay because of the Revolution, which he believes (or wants to believe, anyway) will improve life for him and his people, Batista killed his free-thinking father, viva la Revoluci&oacute;n, yadda yadda yadda.  I understand that movies don't always have happy endings, but I think that there is a middle ground between \"boy and girl live happily ever after\" to \"girl lives happily ever after and boy gets sent to the gulag after he finds out that Castro isn't exactly the nice guy he claims to be and wow, Batista was a cakewalk compared to this, and has to spend his years in a drawer cell where he would kick himself for his earlier decision if, you know, he could actually kick himself, but drawer cells don't allow that.\"  I truly think that the filmmakers did not anticipate their audience to think this much, which is understandable, but come on--everyone knows that communist Cuba is no picnic, and when Katey says something along the lines of \"I know that we'll meet again,\" I couldn't help but thinking that the only way THAT would happen would be if Javier braves the Gulf and takes up Florida's wet feet dry feet policy.  In fact, when I told my friend about the ending he said, \"that boy is going to have to stop dancing and learn to convert his '57 Chevy into a boat.\"I understand that people at first thought that Castro was fantastic and he didn't reveal his true intentions until later, but the fact remains that Cuba was politically instable and to choose to stay there instead of going to America was still pretty questionable.  And then Katey's optimistic \"We'll see each other again someday!\" was just waaaay too much for me.So, in short, if you're like me and you can't turn off your brain while watching a movie, this one's going to give you a lot of issues.  If you CAN turn off your brain and just enjoy it for what it is--a dance movie--you'll probably like it, though find some things (like the romance) lacking."],["bought it because patrick swayze was in it love seening how cuba used to be before all that stuff happen pretty good movie"],["So much better than the originial, in my opinion.

I wished I had gotten a better ending, but the I enjoyed the film overall."],["I bought this film purely out of curiosity, and because I didn't see how they could make a sequel to Dirty Dancing, with a cast of unknowns. In reality, it's a \"based on true events\" (the plot is loosely based on the life story of producer JoAnn Jansen, who moved to Cuba with her family in 1958), and a stand alone film, which can be watched by those young kids who still haven't seen the original. Plus it's got a PG certificate, whereas the original had a PG-13 certificate. I know, big difference, but this one was really tame at times. Some scenes were only implied (their original first kiss was completely cut out of it, and they never slept together on-screen unlike the original.) Plus it was supposed to be set 5 years before the original was - the original was 1963, the sequel 1958, for anyone who can't add. Strange that, because with a 17 year difference between the original & the sequel, Patrick Swayze still looks the same.Patrick Swayze has little more than an extended cameo in this, playing a dancing instructor, and teaching much of the same moves that he taught Baby in the original. The lead guy definitely doesn't have as much charm or charisma as Patrick has in his little finger. Patrick shows he can still do the same moves he perfected 17 years ago, albeit sweatily.The music rocks in this movie. Instead of the same old dances & moves done in the original, it's more sexier and dirtier Cuban-inspired dancing. Most of the soundtrack I actually found was a turn-on (must be one of those days), especially the \"hoo-ha\" song! And if you listen closely, I heard it once near the end, there's a Cuban-inspired instrumental version of \"I've Had The Time Of My Life\".I wasn't keen on the male lead in this, as I've already mentioned, but Romola Garai who played Katey was fantastic, and very familiar-looking, although I haven't seen any of her other movies. Her little sister, was played by Mika Boorem, who was in the start of Riding In Cars With Boys. There was a little chemistry between the two lead actors, but not as much as Jennifer & Patrick. Romola played Katey a lot different to Baby, although the awkwardness comes through in the dancing scenes. I would love to dance like that, it's totally sexy, and great foreplay too.The film starts off very slow, and the first time I watched it, I actually switched it off 18 minutes into it, and put on something else instead. You have to persevere with this movie, cos believe me it does get better.I doubt I'll be getting my guy to sign up to be my Patrick Swayze anytime soon, but the dancing and Romola is definitely the best parts of this movies. You'll be dancing around the house after watching this, and I'm going off to dance in the shower now! Hmmmmmmm . . . soundtrack?! :)"],["Very good movie. Should have been named Havana Nights and without affiliation of a classic like Dirty Dancing for more fair judgement."],["I loved the original Dirty Dancing, and loved rewatching it this year. Maybe I am just too old now to find anything tantalizing about an adolescent boy trying to be sensual, but it didn't work for me. The dancing was weak, even when extras were in the forefront.

It's not a movie about the political context, it's about dancing, and DD Havana Nights is a success.Diego Luna and Romola Garai are fantastic, they dance really well together, everything fits in that area.

Thus, I was surprised to hear about \"Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights\" in 2004. Why did they wait so long? And is it a sequel, a prequel, a re-interpretation, or a whole movie on its own? Honestly, I think it did itself a disservice by having \"Dirty Dancing\" in the title. They were obviously trying to capitalize on the classic film, but the time to do that was closer to 1987, not 17 years later!This movie takes place in 1958, on the eve of Cuba's revolution, and opens similarly to \"Dirty Dancing\". The protagonist is a girl on the cusp of adulthood, riding in the back of the car and musing on her interests in life. In the original, Baby was an idealistic daddy's girl who dreamed of joining the Peace Corps in Kennedy's optimistic age of 1963. The years are significant, because Patrick Swayze has an extended cameo sequence as a dance instructor. Is he Johnny or not from the original movie? Hard to say, as the credits at the end of the film don't name him as that character, and in this film he looks a lot older (obviously), yet he's supposed to be five years younger than when he was in the original. Confusing?Well, taken as a completely separate film, it is entertaining with GREAT music. But purist for the Cuban music of the 1950s won't like it either, as it is definitely music blended from the traditions of Cuban style with the modern hip-hop rhythms that satisfy our feet. I love the music enough to buy the soundtrack, but as for watching the film over and over...I just didn't felt drawn in like the way \"Dirty Dancing\" did all those summers ago. That film had heart and was a surprise, under the radar discovery. This one, though based on the choreographer's life, seems to be attempting to cash in on the other's success, but it fails. Its proof that the magic some films have aren't easily transferrable to another. All the magical ingredients/elements have to be right, and this one simply fails to live up to the other. The smartest thing the producers could have done to promote the film was not use \"Dirty Dancing\" in the title. It might have done better in theaters. But then again, a film with a backdrop of the Cuban Revolution is a tough sell to American audiences anyway.So, skip the film and buy the soundtrack. That's one thing you can play over and over without getting tired of."],["This is just a fun movie. With great salsa music, dancing, and a love story.

In fact, she refuses to even speak to her family for a few days, giving them the famous silent treatment.  What 18 year-old would be thrilled at having to leave behind their school, friends, and familiar surroundings to move to a country that is on the brink of a revolution?!Bookish and shy A-student Katey arrives in Havana where her innate curiosity comes alive, as she becomes entranced by all the new sights and things around her.  She resolutely decides to try and make the best of her new home, and soon is pulled into life in Havana.  Although she is a bit quiet and standoffish to the other students at first (children of the \"smart set\": from the other well-to-do families staying at the Oceana Hotel), she soon catches the eye of one of the boys: her father's boss's son, James Phelps (Jonathan Jackson).  He becomes interested in her beauty and brains (as she \"shows up\" the other students in class), and begins to pursue her, while their mothers stand by encouraging.  One night as they are out on the town, Katey is completely put off by his snobbish manner and the way he looks down on the native Cubans and treats them like lowly servants.It is a local Cuban boy who works at the hotel, Javier Suarez (Diego Luna), who sparks her interest when by chance she happens to see him dancing in the streets of Havana. She is wide-eyed at the Latin steps, moving with a fluid rhythm and sensual grace like she has never seen anyone dance before.Katey soon tries to emulate the Latin influenced dance that she sees at the local nightclub, but without much success.  When it comes to the foxtrot, waltz, or other popular dances of the 1950's, Katey knows every step, but she knows nothing about Latin dance.  Patrick Swayze makes a cameo appearance in the film as a dance instructor at the Oceana Hotel: choice moments that the viewing audience went crazy over!  Katey's parents are retired Ballroom Dance Champions and are completely unaware of their daughter's growing rebellion, believing she is spending her days and nights out with the \"parent-approved\" James.  Instead, Katey is spending every moment she can with Javier: but he is about to show her that she knows nothing about moving her body to the beat of the music.  And as the revolution in Cuba swells on and their passion begins to grow...Content: For those of you worried about taking your kids: There is some language: a few uses of the Lord's name and a few swear words, not too much.  There is some violence when the Cuban police break up a party and a few times where people brandish a gun and threaten others.  Scenes at a Havana nightclub: the dancing often shows the guy putting his hands all over his partner as they are dancing: very sensual and sexual.  There is some passionate kissing, and a scene that shows a \"morning after\" type scene, but there is nothing too graphic.  There is dance practice on the beach and in the water, a woman slapping another in the face, a guy giving his unwanted attentions to a girl (mostly kissing, it stops in time).  Be aware though, that the entire tone of the film is very sexual, and is all about moving your body to the Latin rhythm with your dance partner.From the great Latin music to the beautiful dancing, this film is worth the watch (although I would definitely not take any little ones along).  The love story between Katey and Javier is sweet and touching, and enough reason alone to give this film a go!"],["So, the Patrick S cameo was a little weird... and there were certain points in the movie where you could layover the storyline of the 1st movie (ie &#34;you're just not worth it&#34; with fists raised) but I did appreciate the music (a neat mix of period cuban and modern.)I think this is just a check mark for someone who grew up with the original and couldn't let this one go unseen."],["Loved the movie and story line.

Her dedication to help Javier yields a bitter-sweet reward as they both get more than they expected in freedom, intimacy, and royalty in the world of great music and rhythm that make their last dance the dance of a lifetime. This movie is truly delightful to watch over and over. The captivating music, creative dance, and wonderful love story all come together in a symbolic journey through life!"],["Patrick Swayze makes little more than a guest appearance in \"Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights,\" the misbegotten \"sequel\" to the 1987 box office smash that turned the actor into a bona fide movie star.This time around the focus is on Katey Miller (Romola Garai), a high school senior who moves with her family to Cuba in 1958, right on the eve of the Castro revolution.  While there, she goes from being a white-bread, college-bound bookworm to a hot-blooded Latin dancer under the tutelage of a young Cuban (\"Y Tu Mama Tambien\"'s Diego Luna) who works poolside at the hotel where she and many other Americans live. Naturally, her cavorting around with a dark-skinned native raises a whole host of hackles among the snooty foreigners who live only to feed off the sweat and hard work of the indigenous population.Naturally, it is the dancing that is the key element in a film of this type, but even the choreography, which isn`t really all that impressive to begin with, can't overcome the film's humdrum storyline, shallow characterizations and infantile view of international politics.  The complexities of the Cuban revolution are glossed over in favor of soap opera mechanics and corny melodramatics.  As \"Doctor Zhivago\" proved long ago (only better), there's nothing like a governmental overthrow to put a little sizzle into your love life.As noted earlier, Swayze stops by briefly to reprise his role as Johnny Castle, providing Katie with a few words of wisdom and encouragement and showing her a few nifty dance moves before sending her on her way.  I hope Swayze was paid well for his efforts, but it seems a bit demeaning for a star of Swayze's caliber to be treated in so ungrateful and cavalier a fashion.  The irony is that the film would have been far more interesting had it focused on Castle instead of Katie, but it's obvious that the studio executives who green lighted this project weren't about to bankroll a dance film with a middle-aged actor in the lead role.  That \"Shall We Dance?\" will wind up doing far better at the box office than \"Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights\" may provide some sweet vindication not only for Swayze but for all the fans of the original film for which this sequel was allegedly made."],["i absolutely loved this movie! i fell in love with javier. the dancing is very sexy. i went back to the theatre the next night to see it again....i cant wait for it to come out on video!!! i definately recommend this movie. considering that fact that it is a sequel, i was very impressed...expecially when patrick swayze showed up! this is definately my new favourite movie."],["I loved the movie. It was awesome. I love dancing movie with a love story.

Amidst country clubs, pool-side cattiness from socialites, and adjusting to her new life, she meets Javier Suarez, a waiter with a passion for dancing and the sole responsibilty of providing for his large family. Immediately drawn to Javier and the world he represents, Katey persuades him to be her partner in the prestigious dance contest at the Palace Hotel. Soon, Katey visits the local club \"La Rosa Negra\" with him and experiences a side of life and herself that she has never seen before; stealing away day and night to explore both the city and the relationship that they begin to form. As their attraction builds and the contest nears, they both must overcome their fears to dance in the perfect sensual harmony, unknowing that a volcano of revolutionary violence on Havana's streets is about to erupt.As the fresh-faced Katey, Romola Garai (previously seen in the British hit \"I Capture The Castle\") brings innocense to the screen, as well as a hindered sensuality that she must discover. As young Javier, Diego Luna (most memorable in \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\") is a new, smoldering presence in film, with the perfect mix of sex appeal and a frivolous, almost childlike appearance. Although their characters suffer through some awkwardness due to corny bits in the script, Garai and Luna have remarkable chemistry on film.The backbone to this movie however, is the soundtrack and the dancing, both of which are truly spectacular. It is remarkable to note that neither Luna nor Garai had any dancing training before shooting, as their natural ease makes the choreography irresistable, sensual, and delicious to watch. The soundtrack, with sexy Cuban beats mixed with hip-hop from Wyclef Jean and Mya among others provide a toe-tapping setting, which enhances the experience for the audience.Although some moments are cliched, corny lines are delivered, and the plot can be predictable, \"Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights\" offers so much, that those things can easily be overlooked. From the chemistry onscreen, to the amazing dancing and soundtrack, and the costumes and sets, it creates an entire world of sensuality and personality, that it will delight every moveigoer."],["I love this movie very much becasue it takes place in cuba and diego luna and romola garai are great in it.I love the dance moves and the romance they had this movie has a great meaning it is that evening if your shy or u think u cant do any thing u can thats the meaning of this movie.The soundtrack is great i love the sapinsh and salsa music put together and i love the director who mad this movie.this movie is a thumps up who ever did not see it go see it its a great movie for the family and it teachers u a lesson never to give up in life."],["This film deserves an award: A Razzie that is.

I thought that the performances by Diego Luna and Romola Garai were excellent, and their chemistry was just great. They made it so believable.

As if to stress the historical fact and social background, rich father of our uptight American girl Katey (Galai who in fact is an English) is working for one of the biggest motor companies, and her friend January Jones literally despises a Cuban youth Javier (Luna who is in fact a Mexican).Someone please tell the producers that this kind of film doesn't need this complicated, politically conscious story.  All you need is an American girl who meets a boy in Cuba.  Period.  All you have to add is good music.  (Thankfully, the Cuban music here is irresitible, and it is always so.)But for all good soundtrack, the dancing scenes are less than satisfactory.  The dance sequences themselves are pretty good (though obviously the leads need more lesson), they are too short, and the final chapter that should be the rousing finale is interrupted by ... yes, politics, or the revolution.  Even the fans of Diego Luna, who must have given this film positive reviews, would agree with me.  Why should we be reminded of Castro reperatedly when we need more dancing?There are lots of films about dancing, and my favorite is Buz Luhrmann's 'Strictly Ballroom.'  Please see it, and then you know ehat I mean."],["I really enjoyed this movie.  It was a pleasant surprise.I also enjoyed Patrick's appearance in this movie as a danceinstructor.

So what? Most of the folks ordering this DVD are buying it for one reason: they grew up watching four turtles beat the crap out of foot soldiers every day after school. This is a way for them to relive those cartoons whenever they want.Here's what I can say: you're older now, so you will notice a lot of the flaws that came with children's animation in the late 80s and early 90s. Those were just part of their charm. At the time we overlooked them, but now they are blatantly obvious. Not that most of us care, because these are the cartoons we grew up with. I don't have children, but I imagine most kids will enjoy it simply because it's animation. Most probably won't even realize that the cartoon is at least 15 years older than they are, but this, along with the new series, is sure to create a whole new generation of TMNT fans.It's an old show, and it's a cheap, $5 dvd. Don't expect anything in the way of special features."],["Well here it is nostalgianatics: the complete 13-episode second season of the Fred Wolf Films produced TMNT animated series on DVD. This season is marked by a notable downgrade in both stories, art and in voice-acting, though the animation remains much the same. Unlike the previous season, which had a wonderful five-part storyline where each part was a complete story unto itself and yet all were integral to the evolution of the saga (as any good serial should be), this season is very episodic, featuring one isolated wacky adventure after another (much like the comic book was becoming at the time). The one exception is the \"Eye of Sarnath\" four-part tale.The thin evolving story of the season's cycle simply concerns the Shredder trying to convince Krang to bring the Technodrome back to Earth to destroy Hamato and co. Instead he gets stuck with whatever crumbs (alien eggs, Bebop and Rocksteady) Krang will throw him and uses his own cunning and resoursefulness to fill in the gaps. Several episodes are appearing for the first time on video (in the US anyway).The four-part storyline is something of an homage to classic Science Fiction themes: shrinking people (in this case mutant turtles), nature coming to violent life, artificial intelligence adopting Social Darwinism as its credo, and the finale is of the classic I-think-it-therefore-it-is genre (which always has the tendency to be like Aladdin in some ways). This yarn is clearly the standout of the disc as it is well-paced, peppered with the right jokes at the right time and the result is not too far below the first season in quality. The gimmick that ties them all together allowing for a multi-part story exploiting every Sci-Fi cliche is the basic scavenger hunt. This results in some very conscious humor poking fun at this story-telling structure.An alien crashes to Earth interrupting a TMNT training session and tells them to find the three pieces to the Eye of Sarnath before they fall into the wrong hands. Conviently for story telling's sake, the owner of said \"wrong hands\" happens to be in the bushes eavesdropping and was apparantly observing the boys in green all the while. That's the true weakness of these supervillians, their ego is way too big to allow them to destroy the heroes in a simple efficient manner. They need to put on some huge fireworks display and trumpet their arrival and supposed imminent victory to all or thier egocentricity cannot be satisfied. Apparantly he is not a subscriber to the lesson of the French-Indian War either.Of course that is the fun of these characters (carictures?) and another example of the show's dissent into utter silliness and eventual self-parody that really picks up with season three and grows with each successive season thereafter (until the make over). The humor here is goofy, sometimes absurd though not irreverant like the next season. The action is more playful yet still more creatively storyboarded than the more choppy sequencing and less imaginative perspectives that await in season three. Inconsistency in the art is more prevalent this time and the characters are less detailed and defined than in season one.The first episode on the disc finds Shredder returning to Earth and training a band of ill-costumed turtle crooks to frame the TMNT. It is easily the weakest episode on the volume suffering from an inane plot, lame and obvious humor and an irritating exploitation of stereotype bit characters that usually works in the show's favor. This episode is the quintessence of the post-pilot seasons' qualitative decline.The Warrior Frogs of \"Invasion of the Punk Rock Frogs\" (who have nothing to do with the music, attitude or fashion sense or lack-there-of of the culture) are the Shredder's antithesis to the TMNT. They are somthing of ironic character composties being hapless innocents who are manipulated and duped by the Shredder and yet named after men who were history's quintessential villainous masterminds.\"Splinter No More\" is my favorite single episode on here. It answers the big \"what if...?\" not answered in the first season: what if the TMNT had been successful in acquiring the cure for Splinter? We do the story no justice by dwelling on the large plot hole which begs the question: if they had the remainder of the original mutagen all along, why did Donatello not do this before? Well, maybe he just hadn't though of it yet? Or maybe the writers just wanted to revert him to human-state earlier in the episode so they could dedicate the story to the ethics of human conduct instead of hunting for the cure for 22 minutes like in \"Shredder & Splintered\"? Anyhow, I find it notable for displaying Splinter as genuinely sad in the beginning, indeed despondent. It is one of the few times in this entire series (maybe the only time?) that real heart-felt emotion seems to come through the voice-acting and even the art that accompanies those short scenes at the latter part of the introduction (the beginning of which is one of the more hilarious opening bits they have done). Kudos to Peter Renaday and the artists at MWS! The episode exercises the \"be careful what you wish for...\" and \"people always fear what they do not understand\" dictums quite poetically (Splinter even speaks the latter for anyone who is too dull to get the point.) More subtle is the implication that when something about you changes (personality traits, social status, whatever) people, often loved ones, will not accept you any longer, sometimes out of fear that they themselves are somehow being rejected. This anxiety is expressed by the TMNT, Raphael in particular, after seeing Splinter's miraculous spiritual change, which coresponded with his physical change, and his jubulaint departure topside. There is a nice little parallel to that point in the subway scene when a mind control device of Krang's causes the green team to ditch brotherhood for every-turtle-for-himself antagonism on the spot.The Neutrinos return in \"Teenagers From Dimension X\" and once again violate the scientific principle of their namesake. Michaelangelo and Kala gush over one another throughout and although Mike saddens again when she leaves, he of course perks up when Raphael reminds him that he will always have pizza *sigh*.\"New York's Shiniest\" features a mock Robocop-esque character  and has a climax inspired by the film Westworld. \"Catwoman From Channel Six\" finds April's molecules accidentally swapped with a cat ala The Fly. So the TMNT, just like Helene Delambre, search frantically for a stray cat with April's personality.In \"Enter: The Fly\" (another, more obvious though less ingeniuos, nod to the classic story) Baxter Stockman is punished by Krang for his incompetance by means of disintegration. A fly buzzes into the chamber after him and causes them to transmutate rather than simply be disintegrated along with him for reasons Krang (or the screenwriters) did not bother to explain.The finale \"Return of the Technodrome\" finds the Technodrome Earthbound and gives fans the big battle Splinter has forewarned about all season. It is action packed but not as clever or funny as other episodes on this volume.Again there are no extras, no menu music or animation. The episodes are divided into scenes this time which is nice (last time each show was one long title). Although the artwork is an improvement in tone, the bland coloring and dull background are just as lame as the sugar-coated tone of the previous volume is irritating. It is more representative of the cartoons themselves however (especially the TMNT's countenence). Hopefully we get some extras next time.- No extras, laskluster menus and artwork.+ All 13 episodes of season two on one disc for a low price. Good transfer."],["My son who just got into TMNT because of the Nickelodeon show, loves, I mean loves these.  Even though they are from his dad's generation, he loves them.

Highly recommended for any 4 year old."],["I am glad to have this movie came in good condition no scratches or broken my baby love it thanks"],["Who doesn't know the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles? Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello and Michaelangelo, not forgetting their ninja master Splinter, their nemesis Shredder and his cronies, mutants Rocksteady the rhino and Bebop the warthog, as well as the evil brain Krang - not forgetting hotshot reporter April O'Neil? It's not surprising how such a cast has kept such a strong fanbase for almost twenty years now.When I got the 5-episode pilot season for myself on DVD, what I got was beyond my wildest hopes; great animation, an intricate storyline and strong delivery of characters combined to a mixture that I for one felt was a very concrete piece of animated entertainment. Naturally, I was excited when I got myself Season 2. I mean, after Season 1, I had every reason to be positive. Things could only go up, right?If only they had.I loved season 1 for three things; its animation, its story and its characters. Season 2 has succeeded in failing to deliver all three. The animation goes from average to dead. The drawings are choppy and half-dimensional, and more often than not, entire scenes feel unfinished and misdirected, shattering the potential of any emotional impact.The story completely takes off on the wrong foot, too. I literally don't believe that the writer of Season 2's first episode, \"Return of the Shredder\", even watched the final episode of the first season, in which Bebop and Rocksteady were stuck in cement following another lost battle with the turtles. In \"Return of the Shredder\", somehow they have been transported to Dimension X, which makes no sense; and this is only the beginning of a LONG list of inconsistencies that's going to plague the writing as the season goes on.Furthermore, the personalities of the characters took a dramatic nosedive. Rocksteady and Bebop, in Season 1, were charismatically violent, not to mention quite conscious of their strength and power. But in Season 2 they are irritating, useless and, worst of all, cowards. Their voice actors seem to be having immense difficulties in giving their voices, too, unlike (again) Season 1. All the characters, in fact, feel stale and, for lack of a better word, \"clumsy\" as compared to their Season 1 counterparts.And if this isn't bad enough, the entire first half of this season all but ignores Krang, Rocksteady and Bebop; indeed, the latter two are as good as absent for the first half of this season. Instead, a story about an alien crystal, the 'Eye of Sornath', becomes the main attraction (or rather de-attraction). Not only is this story uninteresting, but it has also nothing to do with the spirit of the Ninja Turtles universe. After the dull story draws to an equally dull close, Rocksteady and Bebop DO return, as do half-decent plots - but watch Season 1 and you'll see that you don't have too much of a reason to be thankful. There are no multiple-part stories (and those won't return until the end of Season 3), and the ones we DO receive, while sometimes containing interesting plot prospects, are so badly written it leaves me speechless (\"Teenagers from Dimension X\" in particular springs to mind).There are positive things to be said for this season, though (YES, there are). Season 2 marks the first appearance of April's coworkers; her best friend Irma, and the irritating toady Vernon. These two characters, along with Rocksteady and Bebop, since become almost solely responsible for the show's considerable comic relief. Both make me laugh more than anything else in this show.But that's it for the good spots. Rewind back and read and I still mean each and every one of the words I've typed down. The last episode of this season, which is supposed to serve as a kind of climax, falls flat on its face in its attempt by eye-burning animation, lame plot-progress and a nonsensical ending. The music, one of the few trademarks of the season that are (unfortunately) going to stay, is very weak, too, sounding like a series of chopped up mixtures of various instruments - like it's trying more than it can handle. If you loved the rock ambience from Season 1, enjoy it, as you won't find it in Season 2.Season 3 is somewhere in between Season 1 and 2. Often, its plots shine as well as its animation. I would advise you to skip this heap of rubbish and go straight to that season. The bottom has been obtained. Things can only go up from here.To put it simply: What were you thinking?(\"It came from beneath the sewers\" and \"Teenagers from Dimension X\": if you must, watch these episodes just to get a graphic demonstration of my words.)The picture quality is very bad, too."],["Again...I bought this for our local Christmas giving tree...It was so nice not to have to go to the mall and worry about being shot!!"],["This is the old series which aired on TV in the eighties.

The complete second season of the classic Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon is one of my favorites, with 13 classic episodes from the show.  However, the violence was turned down a bit from the 1st season.  The Turtles do not use their weapons that much, whereas they often fought with them during season 1.  Also, the humor has been upped quite a bit, with some real tongue-in-cheek moments(although the original comic did notably have a few as well).  But then again, not to say that was a bad thing, as that was one of the things that made this series memorable.  The season starts off with Shredder's return, aided by inept inventor Baxter Stockman once more.  The next 4 episodes feature a subplot of 3 alien crystals known as the \"eye of Sarnath.\"  The Turtles and Shredder race to collect them each, but the 3 crystals wind up causing all sorts of mayhem, from bringing machines to life to creating insane killer plant monsters, and the Turtles must deal with the havoc.  \"Case of the Killer Pizzas\" is the classic episode with those monster meatballs monsters, and boy are they ugly.  The Turtles have to reluctantly team up with Shredder when the creatures get too out of hand.  Bebop and Rocksteady return in \"Enter: The Fly,\" when Shredder poisons April, in an attempt to take the Turtles out when they try to retrieve the antidote.  Things go from bad to worse when Baxter is merged with a fly and attempts to take both groups out.  \"Splinter No More,\" sees Splinter become Hamato Yoshi again!  The Turtles wind up chasing Shredder again, but he leaves a little trap that ends up turning them against each other!  The Neutrinos come back in \"Teenagers from Dimension X,\" and those frogs make their first appearance in \"Invasion of the Punk Frogs.\"  \"New York's Shiniest\" is a hilarious episode in which the Turtles meet a cybernetic cop, REX-1.  April gets her genes merged with a cat, \"The Fly\" style, in \"Catwoman From Channel Six.\"  In that episode, Irma also meets the Turtles for the first time.  The final episode is \"Return of the Technodrome,\" a great episode in which the Technodrome returns to Earth!  These are some excellent episodes, some I haven't seen in a long time!  April 26th is going to be a great day!"],["This video has it all. Action, drama, romance, plus the ninja turtles kicking butt.

This release has all 13 episodes of Season 2 on one disc.  This means that they used higher compression on each episode to fit that many episodes.  As a result, the video quality is lessened.  Each episode takes up about 650 MB of space, when the average is about 800 to 900.  Lionsgate could have easily just released these episodes across 2 discs instead of trying to save money by only pressing one.  So, the production quality could have been better.As for the episodes themselves, Season 2 is probably the best season of the series.  This season was made before the decision to send the series entirely in the comedy vein.  Also, this was before David Wise took over writing the majority of episodes, as would happen in later seasons.  While not an entirely serious series, of course, the episodes in season 2 are generally better because they have a level of drama to them.  They balance out the comedy with a straight story that was entirely abandoned after season 2 and only restored in season 10.  (Unfortunately, Season 10 was headed by Jeffrey Scott, whose vast majority of work was comedy based.  So, the drama didn't entirely carry off.)"],["Product arrived fast.

After watching most of this DVD, though, I've come to the realiziation that (as far as I can deduce) most of the stunning moments of animation artistry that lie dormant in my memory are those found namely in the show's first season. What I recall of them is that they were bold, climactic, serious, and slick. Dramatic, even. PERHAPS my mind is deluding me, but I know this -- they were in no way fathomable as putrid or inane as the episodes here.Just nothing of appeal here. Everything is so, ahem, goofy. Like, fruity (using that with no homosexual connotations...) Everything just feels off,  and for the very worst. The plots are non-existent or just downright idiotic, and I have no intention of placing some sort of demand on quality plots here... There's just no scope to any of them, so who cares? Again, everything just feels... commercialized? I don't want to say that, though, because it seems like a much worse transition than to being merely for popular consumption; it feels for some reason what I figured the show would feel like by season 5 or so, after it had hit its peak and been taken over by a different crew and being set up for a changing demographic. The pitches of the voices seem higher. The turtles' faces seem extra round and... like... cheery-bright-prozac-happy faces. The only thing that retains some likeliness is the music, with the synthesized droning I came to love and associate with the show over time.Hmmm.....it's like... You ever see Don Bluth's \"The Land Before Time\" or \"An American Tail\"? Then proceeded to see one of the horrendous sequels? I think this can apply for a lot of animated feats, actually. This is just what I feel like... Almost EVERY lick of substance that at one point existed in the show is null, void with season 2.But I'm somewhat perplexed because it's season 2... The show just started. I had no intentions of watching this one before checking out Volume 1, but through a mishap I ended up receiving it instead, so I'll be sure to check out 1 soon... Hopefully my nostalgia is not completely warping me and there are in fact goodies to be found within other episodes in this series...

No more garage sale searches for me! It was fun to see these old shows again, but they are \"the oranges\" to the current series' \"apples.\" While the new series more closely ties to the original comic series, the first animated series, created in part to add to action figure marketing, is a much lighter (especially the 2nd season) and condensed version. The history of the characters is geared for a younger audience, for example in \"Splinter No More,\" sees Splinter become Hamato Yoshi again. In the 90's series Splinter is Master Yoshi mutated, rather than a pet.  Also includes some classic video rental store staples: \"The Return of the Shredder,\" \"The Incredible Shrinking Turtles,\" \"It came from Beneath the Sewers.\" \"Teenagers from Dimension X,\" has teenagers from Dimension X, in it.  \"Invasion of the Punk Frogs,\" features the introduction of more mutants. \"Enter: The Fly,\" with Dr. Stockman of the 90's, vaguely spoofs the Vincent Price fly movies.  Other episodes are \"New York's Shiniest\" a Robocop spoof.  The final episode of the season is \"Return of the Technodrome,\" an episode in which, you guessed it, the Technodrome and Krang  return to Earth.The current generation of turtle fans will still appreciate this alternate selection of episodes, it will also give them an opportunity to get many of the inside-jokes in the current series (like Krang's cameo, April's news reporter disquise).One major flaw of the DVD is the lack of special features and extras, even the games have more extras than this DVD. There is plenty of time to improve considering the large number of episodes from the 90's TMNT (over 130), still look forward to the next volume or dare I say it: Boxed set...\"Life is like a box of pizza\" or \"Radical is as radical does.\""],["My 3 1/2 year old son LOVES this DVD and it has almost 3 hours of episodes so he never gets bored whenever he gets the chance to watch (which we try not to make too often.)

While we get this set with 13 episodes, though I don't get as to why there are 13 episodes crammed on one DVD disc instead of maybe trying to go with like a 2-Disc set so they weren't trying to cram all them on one disc like this.  By doing this there wouldn't be any room left on any of the disc for any special features if they were to decide to put any in this set.  While I like having a chance to get these episodes on DVD so I can have them to watch but how the releases at this point were not being done right at least to me they weren't being properly done.  Although in this set we get the episodes such as `Shredder Returns', the `Eye of Sarnov' 4 parter, alone with the episode `Splinter No More'.  I feel that this release could've been better if they would've taken the time to help make it a more memorable release for the serious fans of the turtles.  Overall I give it a 2.5 stars out of 5."],["Anyone considering buying this deserves to know that, like Season 1, Season 2 also suffers from rather poor video quality, but luckily not nearly as bad as the  Season 1 DVD. Season 2 doesn't have anywhere near the amount of dirt and smudges as Season 1, which leads me to believe that perhaps those appeared on the original prints of the episodes.  So although this DVD isn't the greatest in video sharpness, it's entirely possible that high-def copies of the shows don't even exist and Lions Gate/FHE did the best they could.  And there's evidence of this, as this DVD has chapter breaks, episode screen shots in the menus, and more serious cover art - all of which were lacking in the original release - it seems that they really are listening to fan's critiques! The quality fluctuates, and some episodes are better than others - at times the shows look great. Viewed on an old CRT TV, the episodes will probably appear just fine, but anyone with an LCD, Flat-screen, or HDTV screen will definitely notice the video quality issues.  When I first popped in the DVD, the title sequence was horribly poor quality and I feared that this DVD would be just as bad as the last one.  Luckily, the episodes themselves are quite watchable, especially considering there are 13 episodes crammed into this disc [an amazing runtime of 4 hours 49 minutes!]. I doubt that a higher-quality version of the opening titles is hard to find, and I hope that they will address this in possible future releases.Before, I would not have recommend these DVDs due to the poor transfers, but now I think the video is good enough to warrant a purchase, especially if high-res versions don't even exist - the production companies have long since closed, and after the first season this show was mass-produced, leaving quality as an afterthought.  I'm still holding out that High-Def Masters of the episodes are still out there somewhere and eventually my beloved Turtles will get the Deluxe treatment.  In the meantime, I hope Lions Gate and FHE will continue releasing this fabulous series on DVD and in the future consider adding animated menus, interviews (how about interviewing Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird?), music from the series, deleted clips and episode commentaries [a documentary on the Turtles craze would be endlessly fascinating to guys my age.].  This may be asking too much, but not considering that the next logical step in releasing future episodes is in Box Sets.  Otherwise, it would take about 15 DVDs to release all 193 episodes at the current rate of 13 episodes a disc.  In order to encourage them to do this, I hope everyone will buy a copy of this great show, and with the price this low, it's a really great deal. And considering that, I can't help but admit that I probably shouldn't be complaining so much.  But a part of me still wants them to perhaps try peeking into the vaults of Fred Wolf films and Mirage studios to see if they have any high-res copies lying around."],["These episodes didn't seem to be similar to the turtles shows I watched as a kid.A few reviewers previously mentioned the bad animation, weak and inconsistent plots and so on but I personally think the problem lies within the DVD and digital quality of the cartoon as is takes away from how the cartoon was original viewed with a hiss and/or a non-digitalized sound, slightly fuzzy picture and denser colors and resolution.I actually watched one of the episodes on VHS recently and I enjoyed it more than the same episode on the DVD.Since season 2 is so fundamental in introducing new characters, areas and the different sides of the turtles themselves it must have made up for inconsistency, lameness and boring moments when they were released.Lastly they could have had special features that describe the behind-the-scenes work, and the concept art behind the episodes etc... It's pretty silly that we don't get that.You're much better off tracking down the official videos on VHS and laserdisc"],["THIS WAS ONE OF THE ORIGINAL CARTOON SERIES, MY GRANDSON LOVE THE TURTLES AND HAS ENJOYED THESE DVDS VERY MUCH"],["I'm very glad to see that the seasons keep getting released on DVD so I can relive my childhood as it is great to watch this cartoon once again.  But I have one complaint about how this set was released.  Instead of breaking up the episodes across two DVDs, they lumped them all on one.  Which means that the episodes had to be compressed further and produced some noticable quality loss.  This could have been avoided if Mirage Studios didn't try to be cheap about the release and do a two disc set instead of one.  But other than that, this DVD is a great addition to my collection & hopefully season three and beyond appear as well."],["Probably the second best season next to the first. This season we see Shredder alone on Earth without Krang. He must figure out a way to kill the Turtles so Krang and the Technodrome can arrive and conquer Earth. It has some clever dialogue and some serious moments, later seasons wouldn't. Here is an episode run down.The Return of Shredder: Shredder returns and tries to frame the Turtles for his small and petty crimes. Its a fun little episode and has some good humor. 4/5The Incredible Shrinking Turtles: An alien crash lands on Earth telling them of a powerfull crystal. The Turtles try to find it but Shredder shrinks them. Very good episode and has Shredder fight and beat the Turtles. 5/5It Came from Beneath the Sewers: Shredder and Baxter get their crystal to touch a plant and it grows. It was corny but fun at least for a little while. 3/5The Mean Machines: Shredder finds the final piece of the crystal and figures out it can take control of any computer. Leading to an army of machines! Fun and pretty clever too. 4/5Curse of the Evil Eye: Shredder creates the greatest power on Earth only to have it stolen and used by Baxter. The Turtles must keep Shredder from using it to rule the Earth. Very good episode lots of action and suspense. 5/5The Case of the Killer Pizza's: Shredder uses Xenomorph type aliens to kill the Turtles. A very good episode and has my fav one time monsters. 5/5Enter the Fy: Baxter is changed to a fly mutant and helps Shredder. Bebop and Rockstead come back. It was cool and had an awesome ending. 4/5Splinter no More: Splinter is transformed into a human again but the Turtles think he may never come back. Very touching and emotional episode. One of the seasons best. 5/5Teenagers from Dimension X: The Nuetrinos return for another adventure. Mikey and Cala's relatioship begin to bud. It was cool to see them back but the end is very stupid. A car alarm my ass. 3/5Invasion of the Punk Frogs: What if Shredder had trained his own mutants? This answers that question.

For the reviewers complaining about the poor drawings and lack of action, what did you expect? Were you a brilliant cartoon critic when you were [...]? No, but I bet you appreciated the ninja turtles for what they are.For a little under $9.00 on Amazon, you can get all 13 episodes from the second season. I can't think of a better deal than that. Unlike other shows from the 80s that have lost most of their appeal today, the stories are still interesting and the jokes, while lame, are lame enough to still be funny. The opening sequence with the theme song is just as exciting today as it was when the episodes were originally aired.These episodes contain some great stuff. Shredder comes back from Dimension X to destroy the turtles by Krang's demands. Baxter Stockman is freed from prison, and eventually becomes the mutant fly we know him as. Bebop and Rocksteady show up again. April O'Neill gets mutated into a catwoman, Splinter gets a brief stint as a human again, Napoleon Bonafrog (and three other mutated frogs are created), the Neutrinos appear for an episode, and Shredder launches all kinds of bumbled attempts to attack the turtles, before Krang ultimately comes back from Dimension X in the Technodrome.Children of the 80s, don't miss this DVD!"]],"title":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Original Series - Volume Two","total_reviews":99,"sentiment":0.6850939394,"label":"positive","best_review":["Love this movie!

They start with peddling marijuana in high school, and end up as hard core crack dealers. Tristan (played by Allen Payne) is the star of the movie and the leader of the gang.Throughout the movie, Tristan's family confronts him his dealing.  During a particularly painful family incident, Tristan's father approaches Tristan and asks how could he end up a dealer when he came from such a good famliy. Tristan is at a loss for an explanation, and responds to his dad, &quot;Because I'm good at it&quot;.The film includes lots of action, perhaps a bit more violence than was really necessary for the story line.  Blue Hill Avenue dares to show how a young man from a decent upbringing can get caught up in the wrong crowd, and how it impacts an otherwise decent family.  Towards the end of the movie, Tristan acknowledges that his friends will be the end of him.Blue Hill Avenue was actually filmed in Canada, in Saint John, New Brunswick.

Allen Payne's the best and has always been, Hollywood thinks Wil Smith is the stuff, (not that he's not a good actor because he is, and I like him) but boy are they really missing out...

I loved it when Allen told his father he did what he did because he was GOOD at it, even knowing it was the wrong thing to say, he still told the truth, just bad, that's all I can say. I must admit the language was alittle much for me, but all in all it was a well directed movie and \"TRUE TO LIFE\" that is the way people get caught up, we all know when you're young you don't know enough to stop yourself from making those mistakes that can ruin your future,  Allen received some scars and have memories that he will never forget but he learned from it, those are the best mistakes to make the kind you learn from, this is why this is such a true to life movie, I loved the bond the four young men had with each other even though outsiders tried to tear it apart. Allen's wife was just like I would be (down for her man) she loved Allen to no end, and that's what count, she made her position clear with him but he knew she loved him, (true to life), all that matters trust, honestly and love,... yes I loved this movie,great job to all.. keep them coming... a true fan of Allen payne and those that cast him in movies,.."],["Good gangster movie.has all the elements of every day street life and the pain that comes with it.great actors and story line.you will not be dissapointed"],["This movie was well directed as well as scripted.

There is very little that viewers of New Jack films/peliculas de Nuevo Joaquin haven't seen before.  With the exceptions below:1.  Allen Payne is finally in a leading role.  With the exception of &quot;Jason's Lyric,&quot; he's almost always a bit player.  As fine as he is, it's great seeing him front and center.  But you can tell he's aging.2.  That adorable young actor from &quot;Soul Food&quot; is in this.  He's a teenager now and I wish his career well.3.  That scary older actor from &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; and &quot;Sugar Hill&quot; is in this, so you know this movie is a dark one.  But he scares me so much that I applaud his skills.  Move over, Christopher Walkens!4.  This took place in Boston.  With the exception of New Edition, the black community in that city is hardly brought up in the media.  It's great to see this film as an exception.  And I don't think this was filmed in Toronto: it actually looked like what I remember from the East Coast.5.  The main crew in this film are four African-American men of various sizes and complexions.  They are well-dressed, well-shaved, and display a range of emotions as characters.  I found this very visually pleasing.  I think folks should see the film just for that.Otherwise, this was just another flick about the rise and fall of druglords of color.  The child actors look nothing like the adult actors they are supposed to represent.  This film is second-rate, but that doesn't stop me from being glad I saw it."],["Great Movie!

They stick together like family, and it is so real compared to the street life that some people are so familiar with. Four friends trying to make a better life for themselves. Tristian(Payne) is the mastermind behind their whole operation but he would be nothing without his boys. He trusts them with his life as they do him.But when there is money involved you can trust in no one. So when the four friends find out the city is looking to take them down they try to stick together. And Payne plays an incredible actor playing the distraut man who has no where to turn.

The fact that you watch the characters come into that lifestyle from childhood, watch the connections that were made, and see the downfall was so real to me I wanted to cry when everything started going bad.  I've seen that life, been part of it, and most movies in Hollywood don't get it right on film.  This was one of the films that I would recommend to anyone who wants to see what it's like to become a true \"dopeboy.\"The most moving part of the film for me was when the main character sees his sister after she disappeared and what his parents said to him.

The only problem is stopping something, generally isn't as easy.I had my teenage son and niece watch this film and see from a spectators point of view, how silly it truly is to let you desire to fit in or you so called loyalty to friends bring you down.  That we all should do what the pit of &quot;our&quot; stomach tells us to do, not what guilt or fear dictates.I would recommend this to all with one bit of advice - &quot;when watching anything that isn't based on a true story, take it for what it's worth.

Allen Payne is a wonderful actor and he really gave a stellar performance in Bluehill Avenue.  The real treat though was the awesome performances of the supporting cast of up and coming unknowns (Characters of E-Bone, Money and Simon).  I have already seen the actors who played Money and Simon appear in other movies.  Clarence Williams III always adds distinct flavor to any role he plays.  Those of you who are 1970s movie buffs will recognize the character who plays Uncle Rob from one of the Blacula flicks from back in the day.  Even though I am not elaborating on the rest of the supporting cast, they are all great (even the teens).The movie was not predictable, which I appreciated.  It did however remind me just a bit of &quot;Jason's Lyric&quot; and &quot;New Jack City&quot;.  Ingredients that made up the story consist of friendship, loyalty, love, betrayal, trust, self analysis, greed and power.  The soundtrack was also enjoyable.

As in GOODFELLAS and CASINO, Ross's BLUEHILL AVENUE charts the rise and fall of gansters.  Ross also uses similar filmic techniques.  He introduces many peripheral characters, panning over them as they work in their growing drug trade; a voice-over explains in detail each person's role in the crime operation.  And it's a long film, epic length at 127 minutes.BLUEHILL AVENUE is low budget, and it shows.  The art direction and special effects aren't as \"big\" as in CASINO.  Yet despite its smallness, BLUEHILL AVENUE isn't shabby.  The acting is first rate.  The writing is sharp.  The cinematography is moody and textured.  This is no direct-to-video cheapie with bad acting and flat lighting.The film lost me in some places, mostly where it seemed torn between a gritty realism and hyper-stylized violence.  For instance, much of the film opts for the gritty realism of a Scorsese film.  But then there's a shootout, and BLUEHILL AVENUE forgets its realism, opting instead for a hyper-stylized battle where the outnumbered \"good guys\" are ambushed and outgunned, yet still manage to kill all the baddies, without suffering even a flesh wound.That sort of fantasy shootout may work for Shaft or James Bond, but it undermines the realism that BLUEHILL AVENUE had set up.This is a guy's film.  Despite her prominent billing, Angelle Brooks's role is minor.  Mostly she worries about her hubby, and nags him to quick the gang.BLUEHILL AVENUE is not a great film, and certainly not original.  At times its sharp dialog verges on the cliche.

I had the video and lost it.  If you loved Gilda you'll love this.  A treasure trove of laughs and a wonderful tribute to a woman gone too soon."],["SNL best of Gilda Radner - fun - have not watched this particular one yet but can not wait to do so. Think I have seen eveything she has ever done. Hands down the funniest ever."],["Out of all the stars from \"Saturday Night Live\", perhaps the one whose star shined brightest was Gilda Radner. Often regarded as the greatest cast member the show ever had, Gilda proved to be the standout of the cast from the first five years. Her wide range of zany charatcers and a pension for pyschical comedy not seen in any comedienne since Lucille Ball made her one of the most beloved female comics ever. Ever since Broadway Video started releasing best - of dvd's for \"SNL\" cast members for the show's 25th anniversary, many longtime fans begged for a \"Best Of Gilda Rdaner\" dvd to be relased. On Seotember 6th, 2005, those fans finally got their wish. How is it? Read on.Well, to be honest, I was a little disappointed in this dvd. It's no secret that Gilda did some of the most hilarious sketches in \"SNL\" history, most of the time portraying her own original characters. However, I felt this dvd doesn't do her justice. It is apparent that the compilers aimed this dvd at younger \"SNL\" fans as a sampler of some of Gilda's best work, so a newer generation might embrace her legacy. Great idea, but I honestly think that they should have also kept the hardcore fans who've longed for her best stuff in mind as well when this dvd was made.To get diehards to buy it, the compilers put most of Gilda's most famous popular recurring characters on the dvd, such as Emily Litella, Roseanne Rosanndanna, Baba Wawa and Lisa Loopner. However, for the most part, I wouldn't say they picked the best editions of these sketches for the dvd. They are all indeed very funny, but I can't help but feeling that they're better appearances of these characters. Other sketches, such as \"Slumber Party\" and \"Candy Slice\", do indeed have many amusing moments, but sooner or later the viewer loses interest. Also, when I finished watching the dvd, I couldn't help but notice that quite a few of her recurring characters were missing, such as Bobbi Farber, Jenny Rocker, Colleen Fernman, Debbie Doody, Connie Carson and many others. There were even a few sketches on this dvd that didn't do anything for me at all. On the plus side, we finally get the \"Dancing In The Dark\" sketch on dvd. Thst skit was woefully missed from \"The Best Of Steve Martin\".I haven't watched the extras yet, but I'm sure that they'll at least be decent. Udually, the \"SNL\" dvds have great extras. I do recommend this dvd to most Gilda fans but advise them to keep in mind that a lot of her best stuff is indeed missing."],["This is how you know you're alive: If you don't smile and laugh when you see Rosanne Rosannadanna, or Jackie Onassis weight lifting or the Judy Miller show then you are dead.

If you were around during the early years of SNL, this video is a must. One can easily forget the details over time. \"Gilda\" brings it all back in focus. I became teary eyed before the end. There is no substitute for the originals. Talk about cutting edge and being on top of ones game."],["This is worth the price just to be able to see Gilda as Baba Wawa interviewing Madeline Kahn's  Marlena Deitrich.

Gilda Radner is the absolute greatest SNL player of all time, and she well deserves to have a DVD chock full of her greatest performances.  Characters I hope to see on the DVD: Rosanne Rosannadanna, Emily Litella, Baba Wawa, Rhonda Weiss, Lisa Loopner, Judy Miller, Candy Slice, and Mrs. Douchebag."],["I agree with some of the other reviewers that the selection of sketches here is not as good as it could have been.  Gilda Radner was a very talented comedy actress but this DVD does not showcase enough of her best work.  Sure, the dance number with Steve Martin is a classic, as are a couple of the commercials such as \"Hey, You,\" but too many of these sketches show her playing a little girl, Lisa Loopner or the usually gross Roseanne Roseannadanna.  It focuses too much on her as an individual, not the integral part of the SNL ensemble that she was.  One of the major mistakes the producers of this and the other SNL videos I have seen is that when they take the sketches out of context they are much less funny in isolation than in the flow of a regular show.  I was disappointed with this, I didn't chuckle as much as I thought I would and had to skip through many of the sketches because they either rapidly got boring, or gross.  I won't be getting any more of these SNL compilation DVDs because they simply don't know how to produce them so that they are funny.  I noticed a similar problem with an SNL 25th anniversary compilation.  I think perhaps these are written and produced by the same people who write and produce the current SNL show -- which is very rarely even amusing and usually just a waste of time."],["Thee will never be another Gilda Radner & how fortunate we are to have some of her funniest moments captured on DVD. I'd be hard pressed to name my favorite sketch, but the one with her as Baba Wawa interviewing \"Marweena Detrick,\" played hysterically by Madeline Kahn (yet another comic genius who left this life too early) brings tears of laughter to my eyes."],["This is by far the best of the \"Best Of\" compliations for SNL because Gilda is truly a comic genius and by far one of the most talented, if not THE most talented of any of the SNL players.

I really enjoyed the DVD and the special features that came with it.  There are some slight differences between the older VHS release and the new DVD release.There are some skits involving \"Emily Litella\" and \"Rosanne Rosannadanna\" that are different.  The performance of \"Gimme Mick\" by \"Candie Slice\" is much better on the older VHS release, however the DVD version shows more of her character and why she is the way she is and it's quite funny.  Overall, I am very pleased with the DVD and am happy it is released.  The only thing missing was the classic \"Harley's Bristol Cream\" commercial.Now as soon as they come out with the Best of Cheri Oteri, I will be even happier."],["The 70's were fun and Saturday Night Live shows it through this video of the comic we loved and miss dearly."],["Bought as a gift this DVD worked fine and had no issues.

STORY ABOUT A GIRL WHO, DESPITE AN ACCIDENT PARILIZING HER FROM THE WAIST DOWN, STILL WENT TO HARVARD"],["One problem with movies like these is that it cannot show anywhere near the reality of the situation.  For example, no matter how a migraine headache is depicted on screen, it cannot even approximate the debilitating pain for the sufferer, or the emotional affects on family members.  Of course, there would be little point in making a movie about the pain or the hardships of an illness or injury such as Brooke suffered.  However, by focusing almost solely on the successes, all these 'overcoming physical disability' movies become more fiction than truth.  For example, I commented to my wife when Brooke and her mother had an argument that they must have had greater patience than Job to go from age eleven to twenty-one before they had one.My philosophy is that one must experience the dark to be able to value the light; one must know what male is to appreciate the female (and vise versa).  Similarly, one must understand what suffering is to be able to treasure pleasure.  Therein, I think, lies the real value of this movie.  Although it is supposed to be an inspirational story of overcoming adversity, for the vast majority of people it will help them more consciously value their physical abilities.  Try nodding your head; then think of Brooke being unable to even do that.  Doesn't it make you a bit more appreciative of nodding and the million other things you do every day without thinking?Of course, the movie can serve to provide some inspiration to young people who are seriously injured.  Parents may want to show the movie to such kids.  However, it should be remembered that one's injured child will be very aware of their own pain, both physical and emotional, so parents need to be mindful that this movie cannot adequately depict that element.  Otherwise, it could serve to discourage the injured kid because Brooke seems, on screen, to have it so much easier.In short, I think this is a bittersweet story that is equally not as likely as it is likely to provide inspiration to a injured child."],["First, I would like to see Allen Rosen accomplish anything close to this in either directing, acting, or REAL LIFE.

We need to stop, think and realize what is important, and it sure isn't how the movie ran or what it is selling for.I have an idea, let's have Allen make a movie on his life and sell it for $1.

Before she had even regained her ability to physically talk, she already knew that she wanted to make something of her life and displayed this by refusing to take a sedative because she wanted to be able to study.While the story was originally written by Brooke and her mother, I can also see the sacrifice her father, brother and sister went through to help Brooke succeed. The story is not over, though, as Brooke is still very active for paralyzed people. I also know that the movie showed what the power of love and self determination can do."],["I only gave this movie 5 stars because that was the highest rating I could give it.  From the very first moments when Brooke was dreaming of dancing until the last moments with her daydreaming of dancing, I was rooting for her.  A beautifully done movie that shows what someone who is suddenly forced into a world where she is completely dependent on another person for the very basic needs that able-bodied people take for granted.  Christopher Reeve directs this movie with a mixture of drama, a sense of humor and shows what a family will do when their world is thrown for a loop!"],["I am a teacher and I use this movie in my Personal Development class.  It's not a movie I'd stay home on Friday night to watch but it is good.  I love how devoted the parents are to their daughter and her circumstances.  I love the portayal of a good marriage.  It's based on a true story and directed by Christopher Reeve."],["This dvd is an inspriration on many levels. First, Director Christopher Reeve overcame his disability in order to direct and complete this project, which sadly, was his final project. Secondly, the dvd portrays the true story of a young woman, who overcame her own paralysis, to complete school and then, get accepted to and complete her degree at Harvard University (she also continued on to post graduate degrees). Finally, her devoted family is an inspiration. If her mother didn't devote 24 hours, seven days a week to her care, Brooke could not have overcome the physical limitations. Furthermore, her father kept the rest of the family together as he raised Brooke's siblings.I thought that this movie would be difficult to watch. Nothing could be further from the truth. Young Brooke was paralyzed in an accident at the age of 11 and, throughout, her detrmination and optimism are uplifting. Certainly there were problems including red tape with both schooling and medical insurance. Also, the family situation was difficult on her older sister. Nonetheless, the Ellison family is an amazingly strong and devoted family.I have seen Million Dollar Baby which explores many of the issues of disability from a much darker side. I thought that it was also a great movie since the issues of whether to go on or to give up are issues that exist in real life and should, therefore, be explored in movies. However, I am happy that there are people like Brooke who are optimistic and choose not only to go on, but to thrive.A worthwhile feature of the dvd is an interview with Brooke and her mother, Jean. There is also an interview with her father Ed, interspersed within. Truthfully, they don't physically resemble the actresses portraying them in the movie but, that is not important. It is the story that is important and seeing the portrayal as well as the real Brooke Ellison is uplifting. If you are afraid to see this dvd as potentially too depressing to watch, let me assure you that you have nothing to worry about."],["it is a good move i like true stories and amazon is a good company to deal with and they have good prices"],["Brooke Ellison's magnificent achievements, both because and in spite of her disability, can't help but inspire. Her biography and this movie version are both a tribute to her and to her loving family, especially her mother.  I think the true tragedy of Brooke's accident was not that she was so severely changed, but that we were all so nearly robbed of a remarkable and gifted human being.Christopher Reeve's talent as a director is evident in this well-put-together biopic which covers Brooke and her family from her accident, their struggles to ensure that she continues to live as normal a life as possible, the financial difficulties of supporting a family with a severely disabled child and the frustrations of bureaucratic red tape to get Brooke adequate care, the emotional struggles of all the family members, and Brooke's final triumph when she graduates from Harvard.I wish Brooke and her family well, and hope to see her on the speaking tour. Five stars for an inspiring story."],["There is a very good scene in the beginning where brooke is hit by the car. They wheel her in and start working on her in the trauma bay. We can only tell you what we know right now. Her left arm is broken, her skull is fractured, and her right knee is dislocated. And from what we can determine, there is brain and spinal cord damage. \"how do you know that\" \"well she sustained severe trauma to both her head and neck, shes not breathing on her own, and her eeg readings are flat.\" \"theres no brain activity\" What people dont realize is sometimes in a car crash, the face and head swell to an enourmous rate, another actress, older, was used in this scene.

The film shows how a family bonded and became a support team for Brooke Ellison as she thrived academically."],["I am so happy that I purchased this movie.  It is really a good one.  It is from a true story,  I really enjoy movies that are from true stories."],["This was a good movie but one part of it seemed odd, compared to the book. After Brooke is accepted at Harvard, her father says something like \"IF she could get a degree, she wouldn't be treated as much like a poster child.\" It seemed as thought the idea of Brooke in college was a new one to him. However, in the book, it is shown that Brooke was ALWAYS planning to get a college degree, it was just assumed that she would attend a local college."],["Christopher Reeve's penultimate directorial effort is a made-for-TV biopic that attempts to bring a slightly more realistic approach to the genre while hewing fairly closely to the format. In all, Reeve succeeded here.Much of the credit can go to the writing and active participation of Brooke Ellison and her mother and constant caregiver Jean but screenwriter Camille Thomasson also deserves kudos for employing brief but memorable vignettes of the other family members. As the husband of a permanently disabled but determined wife, I know too well how spinal cord injury affects more than just one life. Even though the reality is twenty times more difficult than shown here, it's also just too graphic and downright bleak for family viewing. I strongly suggest watching the interviews provided on this disc to get  just a glimpse of how much Brooke truly overcomes each day.I especially appreciate the honest depiction of flawed people and of the myopia and short tempers this type of life can foster. That the Ellisons achieved so much in spite of their situation is incredible.Vanessa Marano and Lacey Chabert do good work as Brooke (as a child then adult, respectively) but Mastrantonio does most of the heavy lifting as the 24-hour mom and assistant, Jean. Reeve gave her ample time to play her scenes and the discomfort created by some of them is very palpable.The ending is probably the weakest link, falling far too rapidly into LifeTime mode, but it's still worth the ride. I sincerely recommend this DVD and applaud Reeve and the Ellisons on this effort."],["I was very impressed with the Brooke Ellison Story,how she never gave up and neither did her Parents.Despite all the negativity from others,Brooke and her Parents pulled together and took each day,one day at a time and proved successful through their trials they came out ahead and her true spirit rose to the surface,\"never give up\""],["I loved this movie because it is very inspirational and sweet.  Full of wonder with a great outcome and ending!"],["People should watch more family movies then any other genre cause it's more down to earth and closer to home. This movie has touched me deeply and truely an inspiration to anybody from many levels. The late Christopher Reeves has done well in directing this movie especially when he could relate to it.This was the story of Brooke Ellison (Lacey Chabert), who was involved in a car accident that that left eher completely paralyse from her neck down and she she has to rely on her family, especially her mother for every little thing. She face the issues of going to school, life, the acceptance of public and every little things we take for granted. Her mother attends her every class with her until she graduated. Within the pages of her mother's attentive for Brooke, her older sister, Kysten, suffer the emotional torment of the lack of her own mother's care, jealous of all the attention Brooke was receiving.This surely moved me and if your school offers a movie club, please show this to your class. It would raise awareness among the watchers."],["What a wonderful swan song for director Christopher Reeve. This movie tells the true story of a little girl walking home from school, instead of riding the bus as she was told. She never made it home that day. A car ran into Brooke, leaving her a quadripegic like Reeve. Brooke and her family faced challenges more than her disability. While friends, neighbors and co-workers were more than willing to help, those in authority positions were determined to keep the little girl living for nothing more than to be taken care of by the state and hampering her continuing her education. The one thing Brooke wanted most of all. Her parents did everything they could to make Brooke's dreams come true. How fortunate for all of us they succeeded because of that brilliant mind inside the disabled body grew up to attend Harvard. This inspirational story of the triumph of the human spirit stars \"The Clique\"'s Vanessa Marano as the child Brooke and \"Mean Girls\"' Lacy Chabert as the young adult Brooke. The transition from one actress to the other was done so smoothly and brilliantly under the guidance of Reeve. His wife, Dana, made a cameo in the movie as one of Brooke's teachers at Harvard."],["&#34;The Brooke Ellison Story&#34; has to be one of the best books and movies (Directed by Christopher Reeves) I'v ever had the pleasure of reading and watching -- it's hard to believe under such hardships that a person/family can rise to the highest challenges which can be placed on the human body/spirit!  Truly a required reading and viewing in ALL HIGH SCHOOLs -- there is too much bullying and not enough empathy/love!!!!!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND -- BOTH -- Hope it makes it to the Number One Best Seller List - Awards!!!!!!"],["The Brooke Ellison Story was truly one of the most inspiring movies that I&#8217;ve seen in a long time.

Fair acting, not enough substance beyond the plot line to be worth $23 because it runs like like a lifetime movie. The only thing missing are the commercials."],["If you're looking for a realistic portrayal of what a quadriplegic goes through on a daily basis and the challenges of meeting life's needs, this movie will not provide that. It only addresses the difficulties of paralysis in a very brief, contained, and limited way.Rather this movie is meant to be inspirational, motivational. It coats everything in an almost cheesy, upbeat, optimistic manner, yes, it's based on a true story, but the portrayal is almost unrealistic in how well everything clicks into place and just works out well almost right away. I like details so I would have liked to view the nitty-gritty, the real difficult moments, the raw moments - those are so human and real-life.This movie was okay though. Her mother really was such a great support to her."],["Emotionally this is a 5 star movie, but upon analysis from my experience it is likely deserving only 3 stars because of what it ignores. That being said it avoided the &#34;true&#34; parts necessary to be called a TRUE STORY. I will surely be dunned for my &#8220;apparent lack of understanding and lack of emotional caring for my opinion&#8221; but read on.In the closing credits they only tell us in 5 words that the husband (Ed) and his wife (Jean) got back together. They never said they divorced! What does together imply?  Jean&#8217;s devotion to the tragic experience her daughter had to live with actually appeared to totally ignore other real life factors. Such as the pain and suffering of her brother (David) and her sister. The truly unselfish person in this tragedy, in my opinion, was the trauma of the husband (Ed)and the underplayed emotions of the two siblings. The husband lost his wife, and had to deal with his other children. He had to spend his life funding the financial support, and responsibility as well as the emotional trauma of Brook&#8217;s brother and sister.I am not ignoring the devotion and physical effort of the mother for Brooks, but the emotional trauma is not fully or truly covered in the movie. The movie ended with Brook&#8217;s, and HER MOTHER, still &#34;going for&#34; her doctorate. This is commendable, but like the &#34;dance&#34; she is all dressed up with no where to go. The rare quadriplegic genius Stephen Hawking could survive and contribute given his astronomical IQ or even Mr. Wunder III with some bicep capabilities and his movie &#8220;Sweepstakes&#8221; are the only exceptions I know of.I had a very beautiful and charismatic handicapped young and beautiful friend in two of my classes in college, and felt I could truly love her for my whole life. She very patiently sat me down, and explained how she could never be tied to, what she and her handicapped friends call &#8220;ablebodies &#8221;. She called it Puppy love which is purely emotional and somewhat selfish of me, and explained in depth that it had no place in physical reality. She had her circle of handicapped friends and eventually married another handicapped man, and while they &#8220;only had no capabilities below their waists&#8221;, they made use of their real life experience, education and with their life&#8217;s knowledge/understanding for dealing with being handicapped, to help others in their situation. They did this through teaching and lecturing in special schools thus aiding the students and parents facing similar problems. FORGIVE ME, but the real world is unforgiving and not as tragic as my friends in the military who suffer even more even with the &#8220;wounded warrior&#8221; program. For these reasons and others, I have many reservations about this movie.I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN ANY &#8220;PRODUCTIVE&#8221; OPINIONS YOU WOULD CARE TO SHARE!"]],"title":"The Brooke Ellison Story","total_reviews":25,"sentiment":0.801292,"label":"positive","best_review":["it is a good move i like true stories and amazon is a good company to deal with and they have good prices"]},{"asin":"B000EHQ7UG","brand":"Sony","imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41RcZ2utHQL._SY300_.jpg","rating":[8,2,7,13,96],"reviews":[["This is definitely worth the money I spent.

I took a very special lady friend to see this show as it was her birthday that day as well. To say that we both came away from that evening impressed would be a gross understatement!! It was, without a doubt, THE best concert I have seen in years. Chris was noticeably shaky in front of the camera, but, when he played it was pure perfection!! Backed by the London Session Orchestra, his own band which includes Billy Kilson on drums and Billy Childs on piano (both awesome musicians), and a host of celebrities from Sting to Burt Bacarach that appeared on his new CD \"To Love Again\", Chris had the Wilshire Theatre rockin'!! Chris' horn playing and the whole evening was a standout performance and I am so glad that the DVD is finally available (I ordered three tonight) and I hope this DVD does the concert justice.

Sometimes though, even the picture quality was exceptional as well.His trumpet playing was outstanding...the guests were a perfect addition for this event recorded in L.A.All in all, this is a very entertaining DVD if you like live jazz and instrumental music.By far, the best song of the show was Mr. Botti's interpretation of Ennio Morricone's \"Cinema Paradiso\" title song.

I'd like to see a DVD with Chris and Billy with some more UPTEMPO material."],["I'm stepping on the Blu-Ray field for the first time by reviewing this `Chris Botti Live', a typical program for those who don't have anything better to be served with considering a new and astonishing technology that seems to have become popular in recent years.It is quite similar to the DVD launching decades ago but with a big difference: old programs, mainly Jazz programs, were relatively fast and successfully remastered into DVD format so that we could take advantage of watching the Jazz greats in high quality sound and image standards. It's also important to notice that many of our Jazz greats were still well and alive there to offer new products, new shows at that time.It seems that Blu-Ray is somewhat more complicated to have old material to be converted into.There seems to be also a problem with the material: what industry currently calls `Jazz' is a surprise I take as not agreeable. Where are the real Jazz greats? Maybe their programs could not guarantee a fat return to the producers ...In this scenario, I was presented to Chris Botti and Mr Botti is introduced by our Amazon Editor as a Jazz chart-topping trumpeter. It's hard to swallow comfortably.The show final results are spectacular as far as we get drunk by the notoriously splendid image and sound quality gathered with the extraordinary American industry's expertise to put things together in this kind of production. Theater is extraordinarily beautiful.The audience is clearly a plethora of invited people among friends and fans, so enthusiastic was their reaction even in tender situations. Passed to me the idea that the audience'a aplause was orchestrated at some 'presset' times.The trouble with me refers to the material. Please no Jazz is offered even with the great Gil Goldstein before a great orchestra and a rhythm section trio leaded by the great Billy Childs and by guitarrist Mark Whitfield.The program is a beautiful collection of standards, just a few 6 songs having Mr. Botti as a lead soloist. This makes us suppose a long list of invited artists, featuring Sting and Gladys Knight.Ok to Sting and his extraordinarily cool approach to standards. How could a rock singer inject so creativeness in approaching Michel Legrand's `What Are You Doing The Rest of Your Life'. Sorry that `My Funny Valentine' was reduced to a gag between Botti and Sting. Also sorry for the classical mistake in the lyrics, when Sting sings `don't change your for me' instead of the correct `don't change a hair for me'. It is too serious to play irresponsibly with `My Funny Valentine', a contextualized song from a Broadway with memorable lyrics by Lorenz Hart.Jill Scott is a powered-voiced singer who is proper to cover some Aretha Franklin hits but not to sing Billie Holiday with that screaming voice. Beautiful woman, beautiful costumes, beautiful make-up, beautiful voice but no sense using her voice and no respect to the lyrics. You can't sing `Goodmorning Heartache' as you sing `Happy Birthday To You'.Gladys Knight was discreet and brilliant and her final scat duet with the musicians was practically the only Jazz iceberg end in the show. Also brilliant is Ms. Renee Olstead in her near teenage and funny rendition of `Pennies from Heaven'.Unfortunately, Mr. Botti is not a Jazz musician and no Jazz may be expected for beyond brilliant Billy Childs'solos here and there.A long making-of extras in the program helps Blu-Ray fans and specially Botti's fans to hopefully say this is great!"],["There's a scene in Amadeus where Emperor Joseph II criticizes Mozart's work for having \"too many notes.\"  Mozart defends that he believes his work has just the right number of notes, not too many or too few.  One gets the sense that had Emperor Joseph heard Chris Botti's performance on this DVD he would have complained it had too few.  Even Botti comments on a bonus interview that he is not an artist that floods a piece with \"a lot of content.\"  \"I need someone to finish my phrases for me,\" he observes.  And that is what makes Chris Botti stand apart from the smooth jazz crowd.Make no mistake, Chris Botti is a virtuoso - a young virtuoso, with so much potential it's frightening to think of where he'll be in ten years, or in five.  But he is a musician who understands, and exercises, the power of restraint, and that understanding shows up in spades on this video.  Surrounded by a world-class core band--Billy Childs (piano) and  Billy Kilson (drums) especially stand out--and a 50-piece orchestra of L.A.'s best session players, he plays just the right number of notes, leaving ample room for his band mates and guests to finish his musical phrases.And what a parade of guest singers: Sting, Paula Cole, Jill Scott, Paul Buchanan, Renee Olstead, Gladys Knight all shine in the generous space created by the headliner.  As someone in the \"behind the scenes\" bonus documentary observes, Jill Scott doesn't merely channel Billie Holiday in her show-stopping performance of Good Morning Heartache, she's the second coming.  No wonder great singers flock to perform with Botti - by turning the spotlight on them he elevates the entire performance to new heights, and the glory reflects back on him.Botti is the willing servant of the song, and freely acknowledges that the real stars on this recording are his three arrangers, who he introduces to the audience and gives due credit.  \"They're the cake, I'm just the frosting,\" he explains, comparing himself to Sinatra, who was wise enough not to get in the way of Quincy Jones' incomparable arrangements, but instead showed up after \"the cake\" had been backed to perfection to top it.It's unfair to categorize Chris Botti as a \"smooth jazz\" musician in the same way that it is blasphemy to pigeon-hole Michael Franks in that class.  Both are simply musicians whose virtuosity and performances transcend efforts to label them.  Pop?  Jazz?  What does it matter what you call it when you can bring out and capture performances like this on film?"],["I did not know Blu Ray is not compatible with all my CD players when I purchased this CD.

Too much formulaic Botti blowing long, sensitive notes, much like some concerts nod you out when everyone has their obligatory solo.  Well, Botti gets an obligatory blow every song.

The all-instrumental show was, to my memory, even better (than this original show) because of the extended solos by Chris himself and his brilliant, accompanying musicians.Botti told his Winnipeg audience that, when he toured with Sting, he was urged to \"find yourself the best drummer in the world - and make him the heart of your band.\"\"So I Googled,\" he said, \"for 'The baddest- *ss drummer in the world,' and up came the name Billy Kilson.\"  Then Botti told us: \"What you are about to see, you will not believe.\"  He wasn't exaggerating. The drum solo (I forget the tune -- doesn't matter) was beyond any musical experience I've witnessed since Oscar Peterson last performed here 20 years ago.I turned to the person next to me and said, \"This is like watching a god.\" At one point Billy Kilson was performing with just one hand, multiple rhythms, with alternating shadings so subtle it sounded like he was using brushes, not sticks.The entire band stood out in the front lobby of our \"Burton Cummings Theatre\" and signed autographs until every last patron had gone out into that good night. I wanted to talk to other members of this all star band, comprised of Grammy-winners, including pianist Billy Childs and guitarist Mark Whitfield. Instead, I went straight for Bill Kilson.\"Who are your heroes?\"  Billy thought about it a minute, (he has a modest, gentle demeanor) and said, \"My teacher\" (a lesser-known jazz drummer - but an influential artist whose name I can't recall six months later).  When he'd mentioned just that one name, I asked: \"Anyone else?\"\"Max Roach,\" he said.The solo Kilson performs on this DVD is impressive enough; but after seeing him 'in person' on a more extended solo, I would urge jazz fans to find a way to see Billy Kilson \"live and in person,\" -- and be prepared to re-arrange your personal pantheon of greatest-ever drummers! Good to see that the Amazon.com editorial review (above) mentions his name and the word \"remarkable\" in the same sentence!The \"bonus track\" on this DVD concert, also happened to be Chris Botti's lone 'encore' here in Winnipeg -- a gorgeous rendition of the Arlen/Mercer classic written for Frank Sinatra.  The trumpeter told us: \"I worked with Sinatra for two weeks at the start of my career -- when I was fresh out of college!\" It was, he said, \"the greatest musical experience of my life\"For the Winnipeg audience that gave him a standing ovation, his performance of \"One for My Baby\" -- ALONE -- was worth the price of admission!"],["Received on time, no problem at all, was a nice christmas present for a friend he love it, recomended 100%"],["This is CD/DVD contains some great guest performances, espacially for those that may not be familiar with some of the artists.

The excellence is in the superb complement of musicians and ease with which they all interweave with one another. Listen to the warmth in the vocalists' voices and diversity with which they sing. Yet they are all thread together with Chris Botti's trumpet. The horn never overpowers any guest, never sounds crass, fused or brash but because the subtle beauty of the sound is so engaging - sometimes his beacon of sound is all there is to notice. There are no dramatic gestures, trumpet gymnastics, distracting pyrotechnics or contorted half-dressed dancers here for this televised special, there IS lyrical energy funneled through sound. My favorite guest appearances from the PBS special are \"The Look Of Love\"- featuring Paula Cole and Burt Bacharach, \"Pennies From Heaven\"- featuring Renee Olstead and \"Lover Man\"- featuring Gladys Knight.We have a few gem musicians to hear live in the world touring at any one time. Many musicians are techinically superb; some are naturally gifted; some work hard at their art; and still others are emotionally connected to their music - very few are all of the above. I have reveled in Chris Botti's live and recorded music for several years, he is all of the above. He is not an overnight sensation, he is consistently brilliant.

The instrumental tracks are incredible and Chris Botti's core band are outstanding especially the two Billy's on piano & drums. CB has a beautiful romantic quality to his playing and thoroughly deserves his place in the line of virtuoso jazz musicians through the ages. Unfortunately the DVD dies off a little in the middle when a trail of vocalists are ushered onstage to sing their obviously under-rehearsed songs although Renee Olstead singing 'Pennies from Heaven' is a gem. If you weren't watching the DVD you would swear you were listening to a seasoned jazz singer. Considering CB could ask any vocalist in the world to his party, why didn't he? I would love to hear him play with the likes of Diana Krall, Jamie Cullum, Natalie Cole or Michael Buble to name just a few. Next album perhaps.

For an instrumentalist to have his own special, to be onstage with an incredible orchestra, a beautiful hall, and most of all to share the stage with perhaps some of the most distinctive voices in any kind of music - Sting, Gladys Knight, Jill Scott, Paula Cole, Paul Buchanan, Rene Olstead and Burt Bacharach. Everyone's here to join me onstage for this event, which I think is the greatest musical night of my life.\" ~ Chris Botti ~Flashback: December 2, 2005 at the Wilshire Theatre in Beverly Hills, California was to me a fabulous night to remember. And that memorable event is eternalized in this DVD. How great it was to be at that concert - the dreamiest of concerts, and it was so fulfilling to be able to watch Chris Botti perform live in concert with his very special guests - Sting,  Gladys Knight, Paula Cole, Paul Buchanan, Jill Scott, Rene Olstead and of course,  Burt Bacharach. He acknowledged the presence of David Foster and Jeremy Lubbock from among the audience. My only regret is that I wasn't able to meet the  trumpeter-extraordinaire and let him sign my CD booklets as my friend was rushing to leave right after the concert.Not only Chris Botti does his craft in a creatively exceptional manner but also has a very excellent showmanship. All throughout the concert, he showed a terrific stage presence. All the performances are backed by a full orchestra conducted by  Gil Goldstein, and Mr. Botti's awesome band members - Billy Childs (piano),  James Genus (bass), Mark Whitfield (guitar), and Billy Kilson (drums). In \"Why Not\" Billy Kilson showed off his artistry in drums. Chris Botti believes that the \"foundation of any music really comes from drums.\" And he quips, \"I may not be Sting, but I have Billy Kilson in my band.\"Who wouldn't be mesmerized with his hauntingly beautiful solo performances that show off his exquisite trumpet playing? And these beguiling tunes are \"When I Fall In Love,\" \"Someone To Watch Over Me, \"Cinema Paradiso,\" \"One For My Baby\" and  \"A Thousand Kisses Deep.\"One of the show's glorious moments is the special appearance of a living legend,  Burt Bacharach, on one of the most stunning performances, well-applauded, a standing ovation and his own composition, \"The Look of Love,\" which showcase his piano skills and Paula Cole's great vocal style. And Chris Botti has the most wonderful praises about the great composer and I quote: \"Burt has not only written so many incredible songs but musicians love him. He is loved by the public and musicians. When you can capture the elements of both things - to be loved by the public and to be loved by musicians, you probably are in a crew of three to four people.\"Sting adds glitter to the show with his performances on \"What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life?\" and \"My Funny Valentine,\" which elicited laughter from the audience whenever his look was directed to Chris as he sings ... \"Your looks are laughable, unphotographable\" and \"Is your figure less than Greek? Is your mouth a little weak?\" After the song, Chris Botti acknowledged and gave credit to Sting saying that if it were not for him, he wouldn't be standing onstage that night. It was Sting who asked him to join his band in Spring of 1999, and he thanked him and his wife, Trudy, as well. Yes, she's the lady from the audience being serenaded by Chris Botti on the intro of \"My Funny Valentine.\"Gladys Knight's dazzling performance on \"Lover Man\" received an enthusiastic response from the audience. There was a prolonged standing ovation. The lady who was seated next to me at the concert said that she was there mainly for  Gladys Knight. Rene Olstead gives \"Pennies From Heaven\" a fresh interpretation that is so stylishly jazzy. Jill Scott delivers \"Good Morning Heartache\" with creativity and elegance. Paul Buchanan's heartfelt and emotional performance on \"Are You Lonesome Tonight\" is so moving. And a show-stopper, Paula Cole's \"My One And Only Love.\"I truly enjoy watching this DVD as much as I've enjoyed the live concert a year ago. It's one gem of a DVD. It's a collector's item and one of my most precious collections of recorded live concerts ever. It also features clips from recording sessions, interviews with Chris Botti and his musicians, Sting, and some of his guest artists plus a special performance of \"Message In A Bottle\" by Sting.Wholeheartedly recommended for your viewing pleasure. It's truly a dream concert."],["You get 2 (CD & DVD) for the price of 1.Great music and cast. Two-thumbs up!!!"],["If you are a fan on Chris Botti or if you just enjoy Jazz, the quality of his music and trumpet playing is excellent. His guests as usual are spectacular.  This is Jazz all throughout, beautifully performed, If  however you want a slightly more varied musical experience as a first exposure to Botti, get his performance in Boston."],["I happened to catch most of this special on PBS the other night.  What a lovely concert!  Not at all boring.  The chemistry between Chris and his guests is so apparent during their duets.  You can totally feel that Chris' trumpet is an extension of him; it's his voice and, coupled with a talented singer, is truly a treat for the eyes and ears.  I was a little disappointed with Paula Cole's rendition of The Look of Love; she sounded kind of like she was sick and was a little off-key.  Other than that, she has a beautiful voice.  But the best performance that I saw, the one that brought me to my feet, was JILL SCOTT.  I have no words for how stunning her performance was.  It was not a sad, slow song but it brought tears to my eyes because she was so phenomenal.  She brought down the house!  Sting was so-so and Paul Buchanan was so-so.  I am sorry that I missed Gladys Knight.  Renee Olstead has an incredible voice (esp. for someone so young) but the song she sang did not do her much justice.  All in all, the concert was great- I wish I had been there.  I can not wait for the DVD to come out!"],["Whilst this dvd is quite enjoyable, full of great artists and vocal treats, why is it limited by the quality of soundtracks.

Wake up and stop ripping us off."],["Two words to describe Chris Botti's latest release: ear candy. Or maybe auditory bliss would be a more accurate description?  Either way, you get my point - I love this DVD. There are no gimmicks here - this is a beautiful, slickly produced concert that first and foremost showcases Botti's virtuosic trumpet playing (which is heavenly!). Most of the musical selections are culled from his latest studio album, the duets-heavy disc To Love Again (read my review of that album on Amazon). The duets are truly duets in every sense of the word - Botti's playing partners with each vocalist perfectly, and the two work to compliment each other, resulting in first-class performances. My favorite duets performances are Paul Cole singing \"My One and Only Love,\" Renee Olstead singing \"Pennies from Heaven\" (amazing vocalist!), and Gladys Knight singing \"Lover Man\" (a fantastic performance, very classy). The weakest vocal is Jill Scott's on \"Good Morning Heartache\" - I love the studio version, but her vocal improvisation here is somewhat jarring, to say the least - but the song is still a great vehicle for Botti's playing and I love the lyric. Sting also appears for two songs - \"What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" and \"My Funny Valentine\" (it's a nice touch when Botti serenades Sting's wife sitting in the audience during the latter number). The program also features some swoon-worthy solos from Botti, especially \"Someone to Watch Over Me,\" \"When I Fall In Love,\" and \"One For My Baby.\" His improvisation on these tracks is absolutely stunning, and the songs provide the perfect showcase for Botti's tremendous talent. The arrangements for all of the tracks sparkle, and it's fun to see and hear Botti and the band cut loose and have some fun with the music. This DVD comes packaged with a bonus CD featuring all the songs from the concert. This is an excellent live recording and a great document of Botti's skill with the trumpet. Now...not to sound (too) impatient or anything, but I am so ready for a new studio album!"],["This is a great album and worth more than the few bucks I payed for it!"],["I wasn't sure about this when I ordered it, but it was a HIT!

It is clearly 480i upsampled to 1080i, and mastered poorly at that.I own both the DVD/CD combo pack and Blu-ray versions. Using an Oppo BDP-83SE and Pioneer 101FD, the DVD version upsamples much cleaner to 1080p. The Blu-ray version is soft and has many artifacts (halos, lacks detail, ringing, etc...). The audio is 96/24, but sounds no better than the DVD version. The packaging says \"High Definition video and audio\" but no mention of \"1080\".Branko Vekic was mistaken in his review, this is not the Botti reference Blu-ray. Botti in Boston is the reference version and really shows what Blu-ray can do.

I especially enjoyed Gladys Knight, Jill Scott, and Renee Olstead. Botti is a fairly skilled musician, but doesn't really offer too much very \"special\" in the jazz arena. He does have an excellent band that he plays with, and each have good opportunity to spotlight their skills.As for audio and video quality, it really is current state-of-the-art. The video portion is recorded in its original format of 1080i (originally broadcast on PBS), and is really quite superb. But there is an 96KHz/24bit 5.1 audio track, something quite different entirely than the typical Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack. The audio quality is as good as I've heard - the equal to SACD and DVD-A.The price is right, so if you enjoy some \"mainstream jazz\" and some new arrangements of old \"standards\", and want the best audio and video that the current state-of-the-art can deliver, it's a great disc to put in your library."],["Version: U.S.A / Region A, B, CMPEG4-AVC BD-50 / 1080i59.94Aspect ratio: 1.78:1Running time: 1:29:01Movie size: 31,01 GBDisc size: 41,14 GBAverage video bit rate: 28.91 MbpsLPCM 5.1 13.8 Mbps 96Khz/24-bitDD AC3 5.1 640KbpsDD AC3 2.0 640KbpsSubtitles: None#Chris Botti Live: Behind the Scenes - Documentary (1080i / 30 min)#Interview with Chris Botti - Featurette (1080i / 19 min)#Meet the Musicians - Featurette (1080i / 10 min)"],["I HEARD THIS DVD PLAYING IN A BEST BUY MEDIA ROOM.

The PBS special doesn't even come close to how great the concert was, they had to spend too much time promoting pledging to PBS (a necessary evil). I anxiously await receiving this DVD to relive this excellent concert."],["I really really really wanted to love this DVD. I've always had a thing for the great jazz trumpet players:  Miles Davis, Jack Sheldon, Bobby Hackett, on down the line.  But there were at least two, maybe more songs on this set that bothered me a bit.  For instance \"What Are You Doing For The Rest Of Your Life?\".  Perhaps Legrand's best song. Although I liked the Sting vocal, I think Botti really needed a mute, (also, the drummer needed brushes).  That's just my take on this song however.I also didn't care for this version of Young's \"When I Fall In Love\". And how can the great Billy Childs (the pianist here) simply resort to some simple blues chords during his solo?For my taste, overall, the program was a bit overproduced and not as lyric as an instrument like the trumpet might dictate. Botti has great chops, but I feel that he relies a little too much on certain musical cliches.  My adivse to him is tone it down, emphasize the melody more, and learn when to use the mute. Also, maybe get a new drummer.  But, hey, he's the guy rolling in dough right now, not me.  Maybe I should listen to him?I do have to applaud his appeal for parents to turn off Star Search and take their children to hear serious musicians, whether jazz or classical.In all deference, if you are a fan of Botti and his albums, then this is probably going to be a great DVD for you.If you are like me, a music lover (sometimes jazz) just encountering the music of Chris Botti, then you will have to make up your own mind. This is a serious musician I believe, and one well worth acquainting yourself with.  Although the show didn't work entirely for me, it may do wonders for you."],["My son purchased the Blue Ray version and it was just awsome. We had the privelage of seeing Chris Botti in concert this summer. The same musicians are on the album. I liked the DVD so much I bought the standard version for my brother for his birthday.

I would highly recommend purchasing these movies for family entertainment."],["MAID IN MANHATTAN ***This is a relatively pleasant, though eminently forgettable, once-upon- a-time romantic comedy. Not even its excellent supporting cast can make this tepid movie better than it should be. Ralph Fiennes, with his sometimes British, sometimes American accent, and Jennifer Lopez, with her beauty marred the minute she opens her mouth, are the would be mis-matched lovers.Fiennes plays Chris Marshall, a wealthy, to the manor born, silver spoon, political candidate. Lopez plays Marissa Ventura, a working class woman and single parent with an adorable, precocious, ten year old son named Ty (Tyler Garcia Posey). Marissa works as a maid in the posh hotel in which Marshall is a guest. When her son accompanies her to work one day, he runs into Chris Marshall and recognizes him. They start up a conversation and before you know it they are going to go off for a walk together, only Ty has to ask his mom. They go to the suite in which she is cleaning, only thing is that she has tried one of the haute couture outfits belonging to a wealthy businesswoman named Caroline who is staying in the suite.Naturally, Marissa looks gorgeous in this outfit and is wearing it when Ty and Chris enter the suite. Chris is smitten, and all three go for a walk in the park. Chris does not know, and Marissa does not disclose, that she is one of the maids in the hotel. Don't ask. Don't tell.When Chris, thinking that his dream woman's name is Caroline, forwards an invitation for lunch to her ostensible suite, the real Caroline (Natasha Richardson) responds. Let the games begin! Marissa spends quite a bit if time avoiding running into Chris in her work clothes. When she finally runs into him in the street, Chris instructs his aide to find her and invite her to a glittering soiree. She gets the invitation via the hotel butler (Bob Hoskins), along with some advice, and decides to go for the gold. With her fellow employees at the hotel acting as collective fairy godmothers, she gets the proverbial ball gown, diamonds, makeover, and emerges a princess, making a dramatic entrance at the ball, further entrancing Chris. When she runs off before the ball is over, he pursues her, and what then follows is a night to remember.Of course, Natasha, who is also at the ball, sees Marissa and Chris together and realizes that she looks familiar. Consumed by the green eyed monster, she contacts the hotel authorities when the morning after the ball she sees Marissa, exiting the suite occupied by Chris and still wearing the diamond necklace she wore at the ball. A review of security tapes leads to her identification of Marissa and a host of other things. Chris is now faced with a choice, as is Marissa.The film is pretty formulaic in that it is filmed as a fairy tale. Of course it has the proverbial happy ending. The film is saved by the very funny performance of Natasha Richardson and her pre-menopausal, obnoxious friend played with relish and delicious abandon by Amy Sedaris. Stanley Tucci is excellent as Jerry, Chris Marshall's campaign manager. Bob Hoskins is very good as the prim and proper hotel butler, though the film strikes a false note towards the end when he gives Marissa a final speech that is ridiculous. Tyler Garcia Posey is a totally adorable child actor who gives a very natural and engaging performance.Ralph Fiennes gives a decent performance but has difficulty maintaining an American accent. Jennifer Lopez gives a better performance than she usually does but that is not saying a lot. It is unfortunate that to date she has been unable to replicate the level of performance that she gave in \"Selena\", the film that propelled her into stardom. She is, however, totally drop dead gorgeous when she is all gussied up, looking every inch the princess.Still, if one's expectations are not too high, one should find this to be a mildly entertaining, romantic comedy. Rent it rather than buy it.FOOLS RUSH IN ****This is a delightful romantic comedy. Matthew Perry is a charming, self-effacing leading man. Salma Hayek is a most fetching and winsome leading lady. Strong performances by the supporting cast help make this a most enjoyable movie.Alex Whitman (Matthew Perry) lives in New York and has a high powered job as a field agent for a builder that specializes in the construction of night clubs. He is sent to Las Vegas to supervise new construction. While there, he meets a fiery, latin beaty, Isabel Fuentes (Salma Hayek), with whom he has a very memorable one night stand. This is totally out of character for both of them. In fact, she is so embarrassed by what happened, that she sneaks out of his house first thing in the morning. Before he even knows it, she is gone, never to be heard from again, until she shows up on his door step three months later to announce that she is pregnant with his baby.Alex tells her that he supports her right to choose. Isabel chooses to have the baby. She asks nothing from him other than he meet her family, so that it is not such a shock when she announces that she is pregnant. He agrees to do so. He meets her traditional, Mexican-American family and is taken by their warmth, a quality that is sorely lacking in his family. He rarely sees his own family, except for the obligatory holidays, while Isabel meets hers once a week for dinner.Alex and Isabel fall in love and have a quickie marriage ceremony performed in Las Vegas. Naturally, as they are now husband and wife. they move in together. Then reality sets in. They contend with cultural difference, with pain in the you know what in-laws, and with the every day adjustments necessary, when living with someone one does not, as yet, know. Then, the trust that had developed is violated, and they each go their own separate ways.What happens with the baby? Does the marriage survive? Watch the movie and find out.

I thought the story was very clever, and above all the acting was incredible. The only one in the whole film who I thought was lacking was the love interest.

An unlikely relationship, to be sure, but they teach each other about life and soon become friends, with Forrester emerging from his shell and helping Jamal in his time of need.

It boasts three Academy Award-winners on its cast, along with a remarkable and heartfelt performance by newcomer Rob Brown, who does great in every scene. Connery is amazing, coming off performances in movies like The Rock and Entrapment, which were from okay to bad, he gives the best performance of his career. F. Murray Abraham has been great in everything he has ever been in (Last Action Hero pending), and this is no exception. This movie could have been perfect if maybe 15 or 20 minutes were trimmed, its a bit too long at nearly two and a half hours.

Don't miss it. -m-"],["Finding Forrester is a movie about a young, talented, African-American teenager who becomes friends with the most unlikely person.  His name is Jamal Wallace, and he is a student in a public school in the Bronx. He loves basketball with great passion, and plays with great skill. He has a secret passion though, which is writing.Forrester is a reclusive , rather old white man, who stays in his apartment permanently. He has shunned modern day society, and lives a life of reading and spying with his binoculars and camera.Basketball provides the link between Jamal and Forrester. Eyeing the pickup games that Jamal and his friends play, Forrester becomes a mysterious figure in the teenager's eyes. They have heard strange stories about him, such as him murdering someone.Jamal's friends dare him to sneak into this reclusive man's apartment. Surreptitiously breaking in at night, Jamal is startled by a scream and runs off, leaving his backpack.If you want to learn how this unlikely friendship between them develops, I suggest you watch this movie. It's a very emotional movie, and a movie that inspires. It shows how one young black man's determination and talent brought success. I especially liked this movie because I like basketball, and reading. This movie has something that everyone can relate to. It's also a realistic movie, which is refreshing considering all the movies out. With an all-star cast (Sean Connery, Rob Brown, Anna Paquin) and a great storyline, this movie is sure to delight."],["If jamaal was actually going to teach Sean Connery something he should of mentioned some other poets that were not European. There should have been some comment from his mother about poets of color to create yet another dilemma in his world. Anna Paquin is a fine young lady but, I wish that interest would have developed only slightly more. She was obviously attracted to him for being the new phenomenon at the school as it is in real life.It attempted to do something in this film but it didn't quite finish. I agree with many others that attempts were made but the development of the possibilites did not happen. For somehing with a little drama it is worth watching. Not thrilling but a start. Being smart should not always be how many common European poets one knows but how vast the diversity of thoughts one can pull together to see the beauty that comes from differnt experiences and perspective. Can't give it a 5 because it was Eurocentric(the norm) not culturally diverse(the future)."],["I ordered this movie because I had heard so much about it and I thought it was finally time to try it. Well it didn't disappoint. The plot acting by Brown and connery is amazing. However, I'm a little dissapointed by how their relation was shown. It seems very static and then jumps around a lot. We don't really see the evolution of it as much as we would like to. Another, and probably the only other negative thing about this movie is the soundtrack. I didn't find it appropriate and it didn't really set the tone.If you can get over these two minor points, you will absolutely love this movie. I particularly like how the movie's plot mirrors a quintessential novel.

Sounds a little familiar?Yet although it is derivative of Good Will Hunting (also directed by Gus Van Sant) this movie really works for about the first 60-70 minutes.  The developing relationship between the recluse writer Forrester (Sean Connery) and Jamal (Robert Brown who, astonishingly, appears to have had no prior acting experience)is reasonably plausible, fascinating, touching, and sometimes quite funny.There's also some nice interaction between Jamal and his family and friends.  Yeah, the Bronx depicted here is gentle fairy tale, but heck, it's a movie.But then the boneheaded, obvious plot kicks in, full of contrived confict between the lead and F. Murray Abraham (playing the Teacher from Hell - the only thing missing is a moustache to twirl) involving a writing competition, accusations of plagiarism, and, Lord help us, a basketball championship.  The second half of this movie is just a complete train wreck, dissipating all the good feeling engendered by the first half.So here's what you do.  Walk out/eject the cassette sometime just over the half-way point, about when Abrahams announces the writing competition.  Throttle your curiosity about how it'll all turn out.  You don't want to know.  Just walk away from it, remembering the fine performances by Connery, Brown and the actors playing his family and buddies.  Trust me, you'll have gotten everything there's to be had from this film.And if you can't resist - well, I warned you."],["I don't watch many of the new movies, but this one has great characters, an outstanding storyline and fine acting."],["Gus Van Sant is a strange director, in my opinion.  He goes for the guts one minute, staying true to his vision as a director and creating something that, while not wholly embraced, is at least admirable and then the next minute gets so commercial that any essence of his vision as a director is lost in the mix.  Sadly, you can't watch a film like `Good Will Hunting' or `Finding Forrester' and think they were made by the same guy who made such masterpieces as `To Die For' or `Elephant'.That said, `Finding Forrester' (and to a slightly greater extent `Good Will Hunting') are not bad films, but underwhelming and generic ones.  Some have given Van Sant credit for not making this `could be disaster' a complete clich&eacute;, but it's not like he breathed any freshness into it either.It's serviceable.On a dare, Jamal (a basketball player who can also write very well) sneaks into the apartment of a former famous author named William Forrester.  Forrester has become a reclusive grump of a man but this fluke meeting brings the two together.  Soon Forrester is helping Jamal hone his craft, giving him inspiration and proving to be a great `friend' in the end.Yeah, it's kind of schmaltzy no matter what anyone wants to tell you.The film has its moments, and it is a tad more honest and less clich&eacute;d (although Abraham's entire character is a clich&eacute;) as `Good Will Hunting' BUT the former had some fantastic performances that truly elevated the lackluster film.  This film, while containing some talent (I mean, Connery, Paquin and Abraham are all Oscar winners), fails to really capitalize on those strengths.  The performances are solid, but nothing revolutionary.  The best performance in the film comes from the one non-actor (well, Busta Rhymes isn't an actor either), Rob Brown, who carries the film with an earnestness reminiscent of Matt Damon's portrayal of Will Hunting.In the end, `Finding Forrester' is a tad too conservative to come from a man who has a following for throwing that said conservation out the window.  No, we should expect to see layers to an auteur and so we shouldn't expect every film to `feel' the same, but this doesn't feel like a film from a polished director.This kind of feels like `The Blind Side'."],["Finding Forrester was a very well done film. The transformation of William Forrester (played by Sean Connery) really connected with me.The key was friendship with a kid from the neighorhood Jamal Wallace, who helps get him unstuck. It was believable because we all get stuck sometimes and help comes from the most unsuspecting corners of our life. You can't help feeling that they both help each other but it is Jamal who saves Forrester's life. He energizes Forrester. Helps him find his spirit and vitality once again.Instead of the old man instilling wisdom upon the young man, it is the young one that predominately helps the old one find himself and his inherent genius once again. This is a good twist that allows the movie stand on its own apart from the inevitable comparisions to Good Will Hunting.The writing and basketball are a good combination and neither is overdone. The story even mirrors the acting careers of each of the two main characters. Jamal, like the actor who plays him, is a newcomer who has burst onto the scene. Forrester, like Connery, is nearing the end of his life but bounces back to be able to do his best work again. A sparkling performance by the Scotsman Connery and could be entered into his already long list of outstanding performances.The scenes between Jamal and Claire show a great restraint that add, not take away, from the relationship between the two. Aren't we all a mystery to each other? The greatness in this side of the story is in the unspoken and unexpressed. Their love is a budding flower just beginning.

What could of been a fine story of friendship is watered down and lost in the subplots of basketball games and ego clashes with villianous school faculty members...The sceens that take place between Connery and his pupil make the film worth viewing but there is just not enough new material to merit the films own worthiness... 2 stars."],["I love this movie and have watched it counless times.

So Jamal takes one of the forbidden stories he was never to take out of the building that was remade from one of Forrester's stories. and entered the contest and everyone was astounded by his work so when he was taken down to Crawford's office to see an nearly identical story by no other than Forrester himself and was pressed for plagerism charges if he didn't cite or was given Forrester's approval. Also, if he didn't admit it and didn't win the championship his academics will go down the drain. So after Forrester notices that Jamal sneeked the essay out he was very angry. After they two came to an arguement, Before he leaves Jamal tells him he kept his promise that he did not tell anyone the it was Forrester who help him with his essay. After his older brother came to meet forrester and tells him about all the written work Jamal did for him out of care. After Forrester realized this he goes up to Jamal's school to make a guest appearance and to read an essay in Jamal's English class. After Mr.Crawford saying how it was an honor for them to hear his words it was then revealed it was one of Jamal's written works. So after this everything turned to normal and Jamal gotten letter's from Forrester after her moved to Scotland. It was then replied that he recently died from cancer and he was given keys to his apartment with a thank you letter and a novel which was expected for Jamal to finish for him. The film finishes with Jamal playing some hoops with his old friends.This film was very inspiring and touching. It teaches the lesson in friendship and trust. The film focuses around writing and did a good jobin teaching the actor and audience more about writing. There were also tons of writing references. This movie is a great watch. I watch this in high school with other students and everyone loved it."],["This is a cliche filled attempt to win an academy award. It just has the look and feel of a movie that was made to play upon the insecurities of the academy. This is a movie that they &quot;should&quot; vote for because its about a young black kid, who, after being mentored by Mr. Miyogi(....oops thats another movie isn't it?) trumps the extablishment.I found the main character particularly annoying. He seems very conflict prone. One scene sticks out in particular. There's this scene where this guy is locking up his car. The kid sees him and is like &quot;why are you being so careful to lock up your car&quot;(duh, its the ghetto kid), the other dude's like, &quot;well I'm always careful with my car, its a BMW&quot;. Then the kid acts like this is some big racist thing and starts yapping about how BMW helped the nazis or something. It was some really weird obscure thing about the company I had never heard of. In fact it seems like every scene between the kid and some what guy (other than Connery) ends with the kid quoting some weird fact. I guess thats what the screenwriter thinks is a sign of great intellect.I would have given this movie one star, but some of the scenes between Connery and the kid are half way decent."],["I might have liked this movie better if I could understand the mumbling delivery of Rob Brown's performance. What did he say? The relationship between Wallace and Forrester was contrived. There were moments of brilliance, but mostly this movie was slow and dull. The closing credits music by IZ was very nice."],["I'm madly in love with Sean Connery. But I think this movie also made me love Rob Brown, except of course he's way too young for me.This is one of those movies that's thoughtful rather than action-packed. OK, there are some basketball highlights here and there, but I could tolerate those because they were only highlights, and they even had enough respect for those of us who know almost nothing about the game to make it clear what was happening. After all, even I know that the point is to put the ball through the hoop.Jamal (Rob Brown) is 16. He's in a Bronx public school where he gets C-average grades and plays basketball very well. But New York state has proficiency tests they give to high school students, and the test gives away Jamal's big secret: he's very, very smart. His mother said he loves to read, and he is always writing something in these little notebooks he carries around. But she didn't know he was that kind of smart. In fact, he's so smart that a toney Manhattan private school wants him to come to them on complete scholarship, and of course play basketball for them as well.In an old apartment building (or perhaps a co-op; it's never clear) near where Jamal and his friends play basketball, there's an old man who looks out the window, and the kids all have these legends about him. He's a murderer who's hiding out. He was responsible for the disappearance of a teenage girl who lived in the building. They rarely see him, but they know he's at the window and he's watching them.One day, his friends dare Jamal to sneak into the old man's apartment and bring something out to prove he was in. He goes up the fire escape and in a window, and finds himself in a book-filled apartment. He sees an interesting curved knife on the desk, and has just zipped it up into his back pack then the old man (Sean Connery) suddenly pops up out of nowhere and scares him so bad he forgets his back pack and runs out of the apartment.The next day, his back pack is hanging in the window. When he fails to take the bait and go up for it, he finds it is thrown down onto the basketball court. When he gets home and unpacks his notebooks, and finds they are covered in comments, some extremely complimentary of his writing, some less so. He decides to go back and talk to the old man. But the old man puts him off, saying (through the locked door) that he should write 5,000 words on why he is going to leave the old guy alone. Oddly enough, Jamal does write such an essay, and takes it back.Little by little, Jamal and the old man become friends. Then when his English teacher at the prep school assigns the one novel by William Forrester, his wealthy friend gets a first edition and Jamal sees a photo of the young William Forrester. Sure enough, his old friend is William Forrester. (One advantage of using a very recognizable actor with a long career for such a story is plenty of good photos of him as a young man are available for such things.)Why is Forrester hiding from the world? Why did he only ever write that one excellent novel when he was in his 20s, and then never another? Why does he now undertake to help Jamal learn to write? Forrester does not want to talk about himself, but eventually we learn the answers to all these questions, and a few more we didn't know were there. Will the sweet young lady who just happens to be the daughter of one of the trustees defy her lily-white father and fall in love with Jamal? Will Jamal take the team to the regional championship? What could possibly induce Forrester to come out of his apartment?[See if you recognize Forrester's lawyer toward the end of the film.]It's a marvelous movie, very heart-warming and intelligent.

You will remember his BMW speech forever."],["Like Scent of a Woman, with Al Pacino, or the ubiquitously mentioned Good Will Hunting, this movie raps on the teacher/father/student/brother motif, and has the goods to get away with it. But only barely. It doesn't impress this viewer as saying anything particularly deep about writing, or in that case about life -- other than to say that one should make good use of her skills. That's saying quite a bit, for sure, but when compared to Good Will Hunting, or Michael Chabon's The Wonder Boys -- films and novels that march across the same ground -- it seems achingly shallow, like it didn't have the guts to take on the murkiness of all sorts of different deeper issues, like race relations.That's not to say that it isn't a better than average film -- it is, and highly enjoyable as well. But if the movie's theme is that humans should push ourselves and our talents to an incredible climax, we should expect more out of Finding Forrester."],["To say this movie was an influencer on my life would be an understatement; if you like writing and basketball, this should already be your go to film. But what (director) Gus Van Sant does here goes beyond magical in orchestrating Connery's and Brown's impossible arrangement. Brown's development hinges on Connery's mentorship, which is fostering throughout, but more so, Brown's conflicted persona constantly battles the curmudgeon character that Connery exudes throughout his performance. \"An unexpected gift at an unexpected time\" is just another classic scene in which we see the young Brown savor Connery's advice on life and more importantly women, as he guides him to the humble man he is trying up to be. Shot in New York, with a great supporting cast starring Busta Rhymes, it doesn't get much better than this for Van Sant's work."],["It has been done a million times and this won't be the last time the \"teacher, student, rebel,\" mechanism will be tried. Take one recluse (Sean Connery) and an aspiring under privileged student (Rob Brown VI) to cancel out a dysfunctional environment. They even have a common nasty antagonist (F. Murray Abraham) to pick on.Predictability is not the problem. It starts out so noisy that you will have to turn the sound off for the first five minutes. Everything from the story to the environment to the camera shots is mediocre. Anything that may have been of use for writing or refereed to writing is glossed over with music or faded out. You can be assured this movie has nothing to do with writing other than hitting the (typewriter) keys hard enough.  The characters (not that the actors did not try) had no depth. Too many things were inferred from obscure camera shots. You get the picture.The Hunt for Red OctoberDarby O'Gill and the Little People"],["In this brilliantly crafted and extraordinary story of an old man and a young black boy cast into an unusual alliance, the power of friendship is revealed. Alone for most of his life, William Forrester has written one book, and that book became a phenomenal bestseller, capable of lasting through generations, and of supporting Mr. Forrester his whole life. Jamal Wallace is a young black boy living in the Bronx. Jamal loves to write, and it is through his writing that William and Jamal meet, and form a most unlikely team. Neither character believes their time spent together will be anything more than lessons learned from an old pro to a neophyte writer, but what evolves between them is a friendship so strong and so powerful, it will change each of them forever. William Forrester finds a very different definition of love than he ever thought possible, and Jamal Wallace is brought into a world that seems destined to break him, until William and Jamal together conquer seemingly insurmountable resistance to produce an individual meaning of love neither will ever forget. This movie will last a long, long time."],["This was a good movie.  It's about a writer teaching a kid how to write.  And a lot more than that.  It's a real sweet and touching movie.  I think that everyone should check it out.  And it's hard to beleive that this is the lead kid's first movie.  He was great and up against Sean Connery. Wow!  I hope to see him in some more movies."],["Sean Connery is wonderful as a reclusive writer who coaches a brilliant, but reluctant student. I watch it as an inspiration for writing. In fact, one scene has changed the way I wear my socks. You'll have to watch the movie to find out what I mean."],["Every day, Jamal (Rob Brown VI) looks up at the upper-corner Bronx apartment from the neighborhood basketball court.  He and his friends wonder who it is staring through the shades back at them.  Their curiosity peaks, and Jamal is chosen to discover the deep, dark secret of the person behind the window.  Little does he know, finding Forrester (Sean Connery) could change his life forever; and likewise, finding Jamal just might be what Forrester needs, too.This is a good film for those who aspire to break out of the ruts of society, and dare to dream, dream big.  Moreover, it is a movie that conveys the truth that we all need each other, and that we bring our own unique gifts to the table of life.Sean Connery, one of my all-time favorite actors, is wonderful in the lead role of William Forrester, the reclusive award-winning author, as is Brown in his role as Jamal.

I found the story to be lacking substance and cliche. Overall, worth the rental - I wouldn't rate it high in replay value."],["First off I can't believe anyone would give this movie a bad review, but then again that just proves how vastly different peoples tastes can be. With the likes of Miles Davis and Herbie Hancock in the soundtrack, it alone is a haunting and beautiful background that stays with you, coupling an urban feel with a jazz influence that so perfectly provides an auditory backdrop to the movie. The local actors they cast, for example Fly Williams III, steal the show and the Great Busta Rhymes makes a wonderful contribution as Jamal's brother, not to mention a surprise cameo by Matt Damon. Rob Brown provides an adept and sensitive performance as a newcomer. The movie is a beautiful study of the complexities and beauty of friendship on many levels and between many of the characters. The great scene when Jamal defends Coleridge in the classroom is unforgettable, and a compelling picture of a brilliant boy from the other side of the tracks with the heart of a prince."],["The other reviewer have pretty much said it all....so I do not have much actual content to add.

Sounds like an uplifting tale of triumph and sure-fire Oscar bait?  Think again.  This tedious drama plays out more like an elongated episode of &quot;Facts of Life&quot;.A real legend, Sean Connery, plays the reclusive author.  According to the story and for reasons not clear, he wrote a literary masterpiece several decades ago and then was never heard from again. He has spent the past few decades holed up in his apartment in the Bronx watching the world, and passing birds, with binoculars.  Down in the 'hood and playing ball within Connery's view,  is Jamal (Ron Brown), a soft spoken, mean-with-a-basketball, but highly literate ghetto boy.  Him and his homies speculate about the odd duck they see peering out and Jamal is dared into breaking into the apartment.  He runs outwhen Connery wakes up and leaves behind his backpack. Later, it's returned with the famed author having gone through withtell tale red pen marks all of his notebooks critiquing his work.  A friendship is born and a protegee/master relationship is born.Meanwhile, Jamal's test scores have come in and the amazed administration at his local public school call a meeting with him,his mother and a staff member from an elite private school from Manhattan.  The elite school wants to offer Jamal an academic scholarship and &quot;wouldn't mind&quot; if he played ball for them as well.  Yes, the semester has already begun but they explain that they like to hold a few spots for prospective candidates while they wait for the mysterious test scores to surface.  He accepts and his next challenge is the school's stern literature teacher, played by the great F. Murray Abraham.  He is a no-nonesense type who is suspicious of Jamal's writing ability and sets out to prove his theory that his writing is not his own.  Oh, he also has a long-standing bone to pick with they genius writer, Connery's character, who he reveres and who sabotaged a publishing deal he had several years ago.Can you guess where this is going?  If you said a triumphant final act in which the good ghetto boy is exonerated and the mean Abraham character is put in his place, then you have the potential makings of a screenwriter.All of this comes from the great director, Gus Van Sant, who brought us the masterpiece &quot;To Die For&quot; and the fine &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;. (The less said about the &quot;Psycho&quot; remake, the better.) I can see a  roomful of film executive suits standing around and something like the following conversation was had:  You got Connery, a legend, Van Sant, he understand this touchy feely thing, Oscar winners F. Murray (Amadeus)and Anna (The Piano) Paquin, now that's class, and an unbilled cameo by a big star to boot!  Plus, it has a nice story about an a lovable old codger and an inner city ghetto boy.  We got all our demographic bases convered!  We got one here that should make waves at the box office and bring home those little gold statues. Wrong.The film is surprisingly unengaging and plays out like a by-the-numbers movie of the week.  Rob Brown, in his film debut seems to sleepwalk through the role and is unengaging.  We learn very little about him and the audience is left very removed from hischaracter.  This is a critical flaw.  F. Murray Abrahams character is strictly a one-note villain.  Anna is cute but has little to do.  This one should find it's audience on Lifetime."],["Very inspiration and educational. A great movie all around Sean Connery is an amazing actor. Would definitely consider buying the movie."],["I love how it came to be just what I was expecting. this movie motivates some. But i'm glad the film came brand new as it was advertised. no complaints for this awesome film."],["Finding Forrester is one of the rare movies that don't rely on corny music and movie cliches to touch your feelings.The message is delivered in a subtle form and although the story is not unique,this time I really found myself caring for the characters.This leads me to the conclusion that it is not what you tell,it is how you tell..Jamal(Rob Brown)is a high school student living in Bronx.He has two skills,playing basketball and writing.At a time in his life when he must decide what kind of future he wants,he meets William Forrester (Sean Connery),a once Pulitzer winning author,who dissapeared and decided to live a life of isolation after the publishement of his  only book.Traditionally,it would be expected that Jamal needs Forrester's help to truly understand who he is and what he wants,buth both characters are in need of help of some kind.Their friendship starts in a bizarre way,and change both of their lives.I was not surprised by how great Connery's performance was,because anything else is unthinkable,but Rob Brown really impressed me.And I was even more amazed to learn that it was his first screen presence.He applied to be an extra because he needed money to pay hiss cellphone bill.Well,I hope he did,and that he continues making movies,because he is a natural actor in my opinion.The movie definitely reminds me of Good Will Hunting,the director's other movie,but although I liked that one too,I think Finding Forrester is superior.It doesn't have those &quot;high&quot; moments like Good Will Hunting,but the movie as a whole is touching,and some of the dialogue and the ending is genuninely original and emotional.The DVD has a nice picture transfer.The extras are average,not bad but cold be better.I think this is a must-have DVD.In Finding Forrester,you will find something.."],["I received this movie today for my birthday.  I said the usual &quot;Oh, Thanks&quot; and set it aside.  Then we watched it.  What a terrific movie, story, plot, acting...it all was simply wonderful.  'Finding Forrester' is the ultimate story of finding friendship, gaining honor, and growing up.  Sean Connery is his usual wonderful self (I do forgive him for the James Bond thing..he does get better with age!!).I highly recommend this movie to any and all.  I don't get the 'R' rating, though there is some language..the obligatory 'F' word here and there.  That notwithstanding, I think that this movie is great for early teens as well as the 'mature audience.'  It is never too early to learn how to be a friend."],["From the director who brought us Good Will Hunting, director Gus Van Sant brings us another captivating motion picture, Finding Forrester, that will tug at your heartstrings.  As an aspiring writer, I felt an immediate attraction for this film.  And as a result, there may be some bias in this review; so please don't hold that against the movie.Sean Connery's performance in this film could earn him a best actor award by year's end.  His character, William Forrester, is a recluse who had withdrew from society after writing a Pulitzer winning novel.  He shut himself in his Bronx apartment for forty years.  It takes a talented sixteen year old black kid named Jamal (Rob Brown, a virtual unknown) to free Forrester from his self-imposed imprisonment.Although Jamal is intelligent and well read and has the potential to be a great writer, it takes the elder Forrester to smooth out the young writer's rough edges.  The friendship formed between the two is self-serving for both, filling a void both had gained after losing a loved one.  Forrester teaches Jamal the art of writing and passes on to him a torch he knew he could no longer carry."],["There is a lot I liked about this movie.  It is very thought provoking, especially in the first half, about our assumptions about a 16 year old black youth from the Bronx who is a star athlete in his public school.  We find it hard to believe that housed in his head is an intellect much more formidable than any other skill of his.  Two big changes take place in his life: being mentored by Sean Connery's character, a reclusive fiction writer, and switching schools to a private one that is better able to handle all of his gifts.  Where it starts getting predictible is with F. Murray Abraham playing the boy's teacher.  Incredibly, Abraham is typecast here as Saleri again (from &quot;Amadeus&quot;) where he is consumed with envy over the boy's gifts, just like he was over Mozart's in that earlier film. Director Gus Van Sant almost ruined the movie for me with this character and the subplot that character brings into the film. Anna Paquin does a nice job as the student the boy comes to know at the private school.  They also have an attraction building. It's a good evening's entertainment and I would recommend viewing it on that basis."],["I own this on VHS.  I wanted the DVD.  I use this film in summer school for English 11.  A great story."],["I can never say enough good things about &quot;teacher&quot; movies.  Dead Poets Society, Stand and Deliver, Hoosiers, etc. are all fantastic at what they do.  But Finding Forrester took such a different direction that even I ran short on good things to say.  To have the real teacher be the bad guy, and to have the students (both old and young) save the day in such a non-formulaic manner...THAT'S the essence of good film.On top of it all, this film has it's educational qualities, too.  Dead Poets didn't teach you anything superbly literary, nor did Stand and Deliver teach you calculus.  This film, however, is a classroom unto itself.  While Forrester does not go into massive detail, there is enough here to teach with.  The movie goes a long way in showing that writing is not a gift, but a practised art.  One does not pop out good words in a moment, nor can everyone write successfully (by this I mean something people OTHER than your mother will read).  You don't become good overnight, and you're a damn fool to think so (eh, Prof. Crawford?)  Finally, this film shows the most important aspect of  its art, which other teacher films have not always hit as well as they hoped: If you want to go somewhere with your talent, just get out there and go, no matter how difficult the journey may actually be."],["Finding Forrester (2000)Sean Connery is William Forrester, a brilliant novelist who published one book and then stopped publishing. Newcomer Rob Brown is Jamal Wallace. He is a black kid, or man of 16 years, living in the Bronx. He lives for basketball, but is a voracious reader, and he writes in journals. He keeps them in his backpack. He thinks he is a basketball player, but he was born to be a writer.On a dare, he is supposed to sneak into some old man's apartment, and steal something. He roams the house and takes a knife. He's about to leave when startled, he leaves his backpack behind. When he later recovers it, the writings in his journals have been red penciled. So begins an unlikely friendship. Or perhaps more of a student to teacher relationship.Meanwhile, when he excels on his test scores, he is offered a scholarship at the top prep school. It doesn't hurt that he is good at basketball, either. F. Murray Abraham is Prof. Robert Crawford. He is a bitter failed writer himself. He doubts that a basketball player from the Bronx can write so well, and he accuses him of plagerism.To further complicate things, Anna Paquin is Claire Spence, the daughter of a prominent faculty member. There is a lot of chemistry, biology, and physics, going on between them, if you solve my equation.Busta Rhymes is Terrell Wallace, Jamal's brother, who dreams of rap glory, but works in a parking lot. He is keeping it real.Sean Connery as Forrester is fabulous, always giving sage advice at unexpected times. Like this:Forrester: The key to a woman's heart is an unexpected gift at an unexpected time.Besides advice, the best thing Forrester does is encourage Jamal to write. He is like an athletic coach in his approach:Forrester: Punch the keys, for God's sake!I read somewhere that writing is the hardest thing to show in a movie, because it's not very dramatic to look at people typing. This movie breaks that rule, and gets away with it. It is the best type of typing scene since David Bowie danced on a giant typewriter in Absolute Beginners. And Forrester still with the pearls of wisdom teeth flowing:Forrester: No thinking - that comes later. You must write your first draft with your heart. You rewrite with your head. The first key to writing is... to write, not to think!There is a bit on Saturday Night Live with Will Ferrell as Alex Trebec, suffering through Celebrity Jeopardy, where the questions are dumbed down to the point that actors, not squirmy and obsessive fact nerds, can get them. Sean Connery is always depicted as a total bufoon. It was a recurring bit, and it always featured a parody of Sean Connery, who was always the most severly stupid contestant of a slew of Celebrity Jeopardy numbskulls. There is a scene where Forrester and Jamal are watching Jeopardy:Jamal: I'll take poor assumptions for $800, Alex.Such sweet, sweet, irony.Sean Connery gave a stellar performance. Wise, sage, but also an agoraphobic curmudgeon subject to the frailties of the flesh.Rob Brown more than kept pace with the seasoned pros. He was believable and authentic as a kid from the Bronx, on the basketball court, but he was just as believable in the classroom, as a literary enfante terrible.F. Murray Abraham was most excellent in his portrayal of Jamal's nemesis, Prof. Robert Crawford. Bitter and disappointed about his failure of a novel, he is jealous of Jamal's talent, and accuses him of plagarism. He is like Mozart's Saleri, a man of lesser talent who yearns to bring the angel Gabriel down. A man consumed with envy. I last saw him in Might Apphrodite, a Woody Allen film, and he was good there, too.Anna Paquin turns in her usual fantastic job as Claire Spence. There is an unspoken romance and unmistakable attraction, but nothing is ever acted on. Somehow, all the more tantalizing, but also a loose end that should have, could have, been sewn up.The music was fantastic as well. Lots of first rate Miles Davis music compliments Finding Forrester. It's a generous sampling of Davis's early 1970s work with side helpings of Ornette Coleman and guitarist Bill Frisell. With the help of Ron Carter, Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, and Tony Williams, Miles Davis molded his second \"classic\" quintet into a earthshaking concoction of fonk and ruck far beyond the confines of the farthest reaches of fusion. Both \"Recollections\" and \"Lonely Fire\" are from Miles' Bitches Brew sessions and offer an atmospheric cocoon of cathedral ambience. This combined with Davis's polyrhythmic funk--\"Black Satin\" from On the Corner--Ornette Coleman's alto sax--and Bill Frisell & Co's artful guitar noodlings make for a pleasant soundtrack indeed.SONG LIST OF THE SOUNDTRACK1.

In some ways it is like Good Will Hunting, which Gus also directed, with a story of a young genius finding his mentor. Gus Van Sant did a great job at putting it all together, and he also got great performances out of his actors. He seems to have a great feel for the Bronx, even if he never lived there himself. He shows remarkable empathy for all the people, and structures his drama masterfully--and no hidden agendas.

And while you're nitpicking about that, know that \"Hunting\" is also a variation of \"The Karate Kid,\" \"Scent of A Woman,\" \"Dead Poets' Society,\" and a film from the 60's, \"Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner.\" So film plots borrow from one another. Just watch the sublime, tender, witty, beauty of this movie and judge it on its own merits and for yourself. The 'conjunction' sequence between Connery and Brown debating proper grammar is special. Or the scene at Yankee Stadium where a broken Connery delivers a monologue to Brown (which I think should've garnered him an Oscar nomination).

Another William Hurt performance, no please.The young black fellow plays excellent and any comparisons to Morgan Freeman and others I find far too early.This film is highly recommendable to buy as you can watch it hundreds of times. It asks the question \"what do we expect from life, what do we want to achieve in life?\" in a way that it does not come blasting in your face.

Whatever you though, you are probably right.I have spoken with lots of people who really loved this film. I thought it contrived, thinly written and not that great, to be honest. The story was nice and it left you with a warm feeling in your stomach, but it was a story we have seen a million times just put into a new setting. (Think Scent of a Woman meets Dead Poets Society.)But like I said, lots of people really liked it. I tend to think it would be more worth a cheap seat viewing or rental price, but if you thought the previews looked good, see this film. I guess."],["A little dry in places, but what a great story and performance by Connery! I would watch Finding Forrester again."],["Think &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; in the Bronx.The tried and true &quot;teacher-student relationship in which the teacher learns as much, if not more than the student&quot; resurfaces in this film, although Gus Van Sant gives it a new spin.  This time, the &quot;teacher&quot; is a misanthropic former wonder boy author, and the student is an inner city basketball player with an incredible talent for writing.Sean Connery and Rob Brown are very good as William Forrester and Jamal Wallace.  The role of Forrester allows Connery to go beyond his superhero pose, and Connery imbues the character with genuine human qualities.  He examines Forrester's wounds and eccentricities and lays them bare, but he also lets the character's arrogance shine through, exposing just enough to keep Forrester from being merely a crotchety old man.Of course, Forrester also happens to be Scottish, which isn't a huge stretch for Connery, and it allows him to plug his ancestral homeland, of course.  (An ancestral homeland he hasn't lived full-time in for over twenty years...But I digress...)Brown's intense, honest, understated performance is an excellent foil for Connery's occasional grandstanding.  It's not what Brown reveals, it's what he doesn't reveal that makes the performance noteworthy.  You can see the intelligence in Jamal's eyes, a difficult thing for any actor to convey.The problem with &quot;Finding Forrester&quot; is that the film spends so much time developing the two main characters, everything else pretty much goes by the wayside.  The plot is conventional and predictable, and the supporting cast is pretty much forgettable.  Will Hunting's scrappy, sometimes obnoxious group of drinking buddies (Ben Affleck, Casey Affleck, and Cole Hauser) were some of the most memorable minor characters in recent film because they were so well developed, but Jamal Wallace's friends and family are barely given enough screentime to have a conversation with him.Other characters fare just as badly.F. Murray Abraham essentially reprises his role as the disgruntled, talentless composer Salieri in &quot;Amadeus&quot;, but this time, he plays a disgruntled writer who takes out his anger and disappointment on his students.  Unfortunately, Abraham is never given the chance to reach the emotional complexity of Salieri, reducing his role to an angry, jealous old has-been.Anna Paquin, one of the finer young actresses of the day, is basically wasted in the thankless role of Jamal's potential love interest, Claire, the upper class white girl.  Paquin is given neither the screen time nor the material to develop Claire into a remotely interesting character.  The film ends before it can delve into &quot;West Side Story&quot; territory.&quot;Finding Forrester&quot; has every intention to be something other than conventional.  Unfortunately, so much time is spent building up the relationship between the two main characters, there isn't enough film left to do anything new, and the final message is nothing that we haven't heard before."],["Despite the talent of its main actors, this movie was nothing but cliche. Every section of the storyline was predictable (e.g. the boy is told not to do something, and he does it), not to mention tacky Hollywood sub-plots (the boy's love interest, the man's sorrowful past, the school wanting the boy for his basketball ability). Half of this movie feels like deja vu, after 'Good Will Hunting'.And it's such a shame, because Rob Brown (the lead actor who wasn't even an actor when he got the part) is so very talented. Let's hope he gets another chance to make a good movie. Thumbs down."],["I have recommend this film to many people. I watched it for a class and found it riviting!

If your in the mood for a drama that makes you think, this is one I'd recommend.  It has a Good Will Hunting feel in places although with much milder language.

This is an awesome movie to have in your movie collection."],["I'm not a film analyst, and I won't pretend to be.  I wasn't sure I would like this film, based on the reviews, which were favorable.  That's because I didn't know whether I could trust them.I suspected that reviewers may have had an axe to grind, one way or another.  Sean Connery will always get good reviews for even a fair performance, his fans are that loyal.  Fortunately, he doesn't mail too many performances in, so he usually satisfies in any case.  Then, there is heavy black/African American content in this movie, and that can bring out higher or lower ratings, based on political or racial considerations, rather than the merits of the film.Sean Connery's performance, to me, was indeed outstanding.  His best?  I save that title for The Man Who Would Be King, but this one is right up there.  Rob Brown, in his first effort, was actually pretty good for a newcomer.  If you notice the acting, the actor screwed up.  I didn't notice it, so he must have done a good job.  It might well have been a veteran actor.Jamal's family is presented as typically semi-functional for a black neighborhood in a major American city (it looked like the Bronx to me, but it's been a long time since I've been there).  His father is gone, mother is great, his brother has an honest but low paying job.  Oddly, the one thing I noticed about the neighborhood is the almost total absence of crime, gangs, and drugs.  That's almost total, since the only crime I saw take place was when Jamal broke into Forrester's apartment, and even that wasn't motivated by thievery.  Rather it was curiosity, and he did it on a dare, like a bunch of scared kids outside a haunted house.  For the writer and director to leave out the challenge of crime in that neighborhood must have been an intentional choice.  Perhaps they felt Jamal already had enough challenges, and I can't fault that logic.Forrester, of course, is being compared to writer J.D. Salinger.  A fine writer who did one novel, and some magazine pieces, and was pretty much a recluse for reasons known only to him.  There is another man he might be likened to, and that is radio personality, writer, and actor Jean Shepherd, who died almost two years ago on Sanibel Island, Florida.  Details are different, but I sure recognize the attitude.  Both men were damned hard to really know, and each had his own means of hiding out from admirers.If there were one loose end, one might point to the fact that Forrester offered no apology to some one he deeply wronged, when he could have.  It might well have been in character for him not to, though.I won't give away anything about the ending, except to say that final scene was an eye opener, and things look really interesting for Jamal.Finding Forrester didn't get very much publicity.  I think it deserved to have more.  It is a fine film."],["Take a decent idea for a film....and then kill it with bad acting, poor direction, and unnatural dialogue.  That's basically what you have with Finding Forrester.  It could have been good, but too many of the scenes were forced, particularly when Jamal (Brown) dazzles the guy with the BMW with his knowledge of the history of BMW.  It's a scene that's supposed to display Jamal's 'inner intelligence,' but it's forced on you and not believable at all.Good acting makes the viewer believe that what they see is actually taking place.  But most of the extras in this film (especially the Basketball coach), and even one of the leads (Brown), look like they're trying to act.  They look very uncomfortable in their roles.  It's not very good at all.  The best acting in the entire movie is Matt Damon's cameo at the end.And this is definitely not one of Connery's better works."],["***** 2000. Directed by Gus Van Sant.

While it does get off to something of a slow start; attempting to set the environment in which the story takes place, just be patient with it and the beauty and charm will soon unfold and captivate the viewer.What was revealed was an insight into a totally different world to which few of us can relate from our own experience and watch as an exceptional young man begins to discover himself and the options which could be his. The young man, Jamal Wallace, touchingly played by Rob Brown, has a real talent for basketball but loves books and words; then a strange twist of fate causes him to meet a strange neighborhood resident who is thought by some to be a ghost.This reclusive man, William Forrester, played by Sean Connery, is in a position to help Jamal begin to realize his dreams. The way this proceeds is the heart of the movie and provides a captivating story of love, ability and determination overcoming the many difficulties life can offer.This movie is effective and compelling and will likely make an impression on the viewer; I know it made a strong impression on me.

All I knew was that Sean Connery and Anna Paquin were in the movie, which I thought a strange combination. In truth, their characters interact little, though they are bound by an innercity youth who is a brilliant writer. The story is engaging, at times suprising and heartwarming. It's not an action thriller or a sports movie, but it is a wonderful movie about people and their talents. Highly Recommended."],["I felt that this was a fabulous movie for many reasons.  First, the actors that they chose to play the parts were wonderful.  Sean Connery as William Forrester was a great part.  I felt that the caliber of actors that were present in this film really helped to make it a great work.  The story line and plot of the movie were also great, which helped to make the movie very easy to watch.  I believe that throughout this show the author was trying to get across two main points:  Things are never as they may seem, and you cannot try to predict how another person will act.The story opened with a young black kid from the Bronx, Jamal Wallace.  At the beginning he is like any other high school kid trying hard to fit in at school.  He knows that he is smart and loves to write books, but he does not feel that this will gain him any attention at school.  Instead of using his brain to make him excel, he uses his basketball skills.  This is how he finds a link between himself and the world.  Eventually he takes a standardized test that catches the attention of some private schools.  Jamal visits these schools but does not know whether he wants to leave his friends.  He is left with the choice of staying where he is or pursuing his future at a private school, where he has the chance to excel in his writing and basketball, and possibly a love life.As he is dealing with this he has another matter on his mind.  He has become friends with an old hermit (Sean Connery) who never leaves his downtown apartment.  Throughout the story these two characters become better friends.  They help one another to become better people.  Each one of these characters  does some unexpected things that change the tide of the friendship.  The entire movie really takes you on an emotional roller-coaster.  At times you find yourself really excited about the movie, while at other times you find it hard to watch because it is so sad.This movie also has some interesting aspects that really add to the overall effect of it.  First, the use of the African American dialect adds to the believability of the movie.  In some movies the use of slang terms detracts from the movie, but it really helps to exemplify what this situation might have actually been like in this case.The only part of the movie that is bad is some of the cuts between scenes.  There are some very awkward cuts that leave the viewer wondering how they got from one scene to the next.  This is not a major factor in deciding whether the movie was good or not, but it does seem to distract the viewer somewhat.Overall this is a great movie.  The author put a great deal of time into making a wonderful story line that really holds the reader's attention.  You can also learn a great deal about life through watching this movie.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who has the desire to see a serious movie, that will not bore you to sleep."],["This movie was real good.

I was  pleasantly surprised: this is a great movie.  It is somewhat similar to Good Will Hunting, but I found this plot more interesting, and less predictable.The storyline basically follows the bond that forms between the two main characters.  I think that the stark contrast between these two(old white reclusive man vs. young black charismatic boy) really adds an intesting angle to the story.  The idea that two very different people can build a relatioship from a common passion (in this case writing) is a fascinating idea.I also like the fact that the films does get into racial issues (stereotypes, mixed race couples, athletes and academics), but they do not form the nucleus of the plot.  Instead, the film focuses more on what it becomes to become great in one's passion, and the risk required to develop a relationship with someone who isn't like you.  The director does a great job weaving these two concepts together throughout the story.I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed Good Will Hunting.  Also, if you are looking for a great movie that you might have missed while it was in the theatres- this is probably one of those."],["As a published novelist, I was immediately drawn into this story.  In FINDING FORRESTER I could identify with the two central characters' passion for writing, for telling a story, conveying a fresh point of view, recharging creative batteries.  This beautiful film was like a taste of sweet nectar.The story is more than compelling.  Jamal Wallace (Rob Brown) is an inner city teenager living in the Bronx with a declared passion for basketball--a secret passion for writing.  He makes mediocre grades in school so as not to call attention to his phenomenal writing ability.  A boyish prank suddenly thrusts him into the life of William Forrester (Sean Connery), a disgruntled, bitter, reclusive author living in a shabby third-floor apartment.  Forrester has published but one novel, half a century ago, a Pulitzer Prize winner.  He recognizes Jamal's talent, becomes his mentor.  The dialogue between the two characters as they discuss writing is powerful, mesmerizing.  As the story unfolds, Jamal proves to be as much of a mentor for William Forrester as the aging author is to his teenage friend.  The ending is tender, bittersweet.F. Murray Abraham is excellent as the snooty Professor Robert Crawford, the film's psuedo-intellectual antagonist, and director Gus Von Sant gives us a story more entertaining than &quot;Good Will Hunting.&quot;  FINDING FORRESTER is highly recommended."],["An aging reclusive writer mentors a young, fearless, tough, athletic  talented teenager who shows great promise as a writer, and is brilliant on the basketball court.

Sean Connery, Rob Brown, Anna Paquin are a winning combination.  Dialogue is crisp, honest, biting.  An embittered professor who duels mercilessly with his students in class because of his own past failure as a writer is the protagonist.  His character is harsh, cruel and fuels the explosive dynamics of a writing contest on which hinges the scholastic fate and future of the teenager.  Powerful, searing scenes of life at both ends of the survival spectrum.  I really liked this film.  Exceptional acting,  a fine script.  Teach those who can learn, and let them, -no-  help them to grow up intelligent,  productive -  whole and healthy beings.

It is a film which examines a curious friendship which is forged between a young black youth (Jamal, played by Rob Brown) and an aging, reclusive white author (William Forrester, played by Sean Connery).The movie invokes the directorial talents of Gus Van Sant, and there are a few obvious parallels between it and &quot;Good Will Hunting,&quot; also directed by Van Sant. To SOME extent, Jamal is the liberal arts counterpart to the math/science extraordinaire that Matt Damon played in &quot;Hunting.&quot; However, while he is precocious, Jamal is not quite the &quot;giant among giants&quot; type of genius depicted in Damon's persona.However, what Jamal is is a young, gifted youth who has a whole lot of potential. The one thing he lacked all his life was intellectual direction. He is well-read, but never had any one to help him hone his writing skills. After stumbling across a one-hit-wonder author (Forrester never attempted to publish a 2nd book), he comes to understand that he has found the catalyst for his future success as a serious writer.This film succeeds brilliantly in its presentation of liberal arts as being an under-used nexus between societies, cultures and socio-economic classes. What keeps coming back again &amp; again throughout the film is just how uniquely human the art of literature is. The fact that Jamal is an athelete as well as a scholar is a refreshing touch, especially considering how most Hollywood movies portray intellectuals as being stereotypical &quot;nerds.&quot;The one factor which precluded my giving this movie 5 stars was its articulation of the relationship between Jamal and Claire. It was obvious that both characters wanted a romance with the other, but the relationship never really went anywhere. By the end of the movie, it seems that the writers forgot about her entirely. Don't get me wrong: I am not asking for a cheesy love scene, or even a kiss. I would have just liked to know what happened. Claire's disappearance from the movie was a bit odd, and it left the story incomplete.Other than that aspect, this is a worthwhile DVD to buy. Connery's performance, as usual, is breath-taking. In fact, his depiction of an aging author made me think of Hemingway in his later years."],["I first saw this movie on TV.  It's a very heart-warming movie and I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to watch something uplifting."],["I often wondered whether this movie would only be both fully forgiven for its flaws and appreciated for its strengths by frustrated novelists and authors like yours truly.  Lines like Jamal's to Sean Connery: \"So women will sleep with you just if you write a book?,\" answered with, \"Women will sleep with you if you write a BAD book...\" go straight to the heart, and made me laugh out loud (much to the chagrin of my girfriend).  Luckily, the star of this film is not Sean Connery or the new actor in the supporting/main role.  The star is not the setting in New York, nor is the film stolen by the master character actor F. Murray Abraham.  The film's star isn't the screenplay, despite some of its stellar moments.  And for ... sure it ain't the editing, which had me straining the forgiveability factor at times; it went a little past the attempt at purposely looking rough and raw to just being rough and raw as if we were looking at an unfinished film made by college students.The start of this film is the relationship between the two characters, who thankfully transcend the easily formulaic aspects of their surface identities and pre-prescribed social roles to become true artists and powerful friends.  True, they had no choice but to go there:  a simple and simple-minded \"experienced but fatally flawed reclusive White intellectual saves a ghetto Black youth with uncommon promise\" would have had the effect of filming an upper middle class cocaine party in the suburbs for the benefit of undercover detectives.  A majority White audience would have gotten high off of both the liberal guilt transformed via it cathartically dancing with the hypo-cortical (smile) feelings of racial superiority that produced it, but they would have been too ashamed at getting busted after the fact by the Black intelligentsia for the movie--or today's culture--to escape unscathed or anyone to enjoy the memories. And reality is reality: THE KARATE KID and GOOD WILL HUNTING are both such wonderful variations on the unlikely mentor/student of life theme that you don't need to see anyone miss at another attempt at equalling them, let alone surpass them--and they would have to be equalled for the film to be entertaining.  (Particularly when, in this racial surface context, a director will be immediately accused of the sin of commission delineated a few sentences above, even if he simply committed the sin of ommitting the spark of new life that would prevent it from being valid.)That is what makes this movie so special.  The courage it took to take all of that on, and focus on what makes all human relationships worth having in the context of what makes artists artists--not to mention what makes art (in this case, the written word) so important, is almost worth congratulating by itself.  But not resting on the laurels of such courage and creating a moving and instructive film that still profoundly entertains and illuminates at its best moments with true character development (though they could have been developed even more I think), is what makes this a film worthy of owning. They say a lot of wonderful things in this movie, in very entertaining and enjoyable, truly satisfying ways.I liked it."],["Those who want high-pitched excitement would not like this story. Those who look for romantic love might also be disappointed. But those of us who prefer to be caught up in a quiet but insistent drama of two unlikely characters will find rewards aplenty. The veteran actor plays WITH the young actor to create a memorable story that touches on racism, snobbish academia, justice of various kinds, and dreams held by young and old.

When I received the DVD and saw the cover, I hoped it might at least have an English language track or maybe English sub-titles. Then I loaded it and saw the dialogue box saying it couldn't be played here. My efforts to arrive at some solution to the problem with the German merchandisers was frustrating and aggravating. All they wanted was to tell me it was my own dumb fault, which they did repeatedly - insultingly, albeit in slightly more polite language.

Basketball is his way to fit in, his acceptance; the school believes he's only there to play ball.  Jamal dares to make his dreams come true.  In this movie he shows his true devotion to friendship, dreams, and his own identity.  William Forrester, a famous author, is one of Jamal's inspirations.  This movie is somewhat different from other movies in that it seems like the real life of someone; it is slow at first, but begins pulling you in as the story builds.  This movie portrays the pressure of being an outstanding student; in Jamal's surroundings it is easier to blend in and be average.  I believe the director did a nice job of teaching lessons in the story line.  Some of these may include:Pursue your dreams now, or you may wait too long.Learn when it is best to be silent.Friendship is one of the best gifts in life.Believe in yourself even if others step in the way ofyour dreams.This movie is inspirational, with unique characters that show how diversity makes life more interesting.

Murray Abraham, Michael Pitt, April Grace, Naturi Naughton and Busta Rhymes star in supporting roles and kept it real. F. Murray Abraham  won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as Antonio Salieri in Amadeus and in my opinion plays a similar role as the close to achieving, but never making it, Prof. Crawford. He sees Jamal's talent but seems jealous of potential for the achievement that eluded him.Here are the layers - is it about achievement? striving? power? race? prejudice? friendship? finding one's soul? the meaning of life?

Too bad there were not a few car crashes, shoot-em-up scenes so that my sons would want to see it!Through a chance encounter, the young man from the South Bronx, and the recluse from two or three decades earlier become friends. Interestingly, it is hard to judge who benefits the most from this unusual friendship, which in spite of the differences, grows into one of mutual respect.Sean Connery can do very little wrong, and this to me is his best role since the award winning performance as the seasoned old Chicago cop in &quot;The Untouchables&quot; He is perfectly cast as Forrester. Another reviewer was correct: he really has to work at letting the tough exterior(hiding all manner of bizarre vulnerabilities) break down, and when he does, we see the maturation of a grown man just beginning become open to the trust in, reliance upon and assistance to his newfound friend.The film has several high points, not the least of which is the well deserved come-uppance Connery gives F. Murray Abraham (who is splendidly cast as a jerk of an English teacher who accuses Robert Brown of plagiarism). This is most reminiscent (to me) of the similar scene with Al Pacino from &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot;, but Connery has so much more power (enough which spares him the need to shout) in this dramatic display of friendship. Ditto the scene at Yankee Stadium where we first see how much Brown's character Jamaal does for Connery's Forrester.I was pleased to see this film avoid the cliches that Hollywood cannot seem to resist when attempting t portray young African Americans. Additionally, I was pleased not to see the interplay with Anna Paquin (the eager young prep school girl with the &quot;concerned&quot; father) turn to the inevitable sex/race clash.As another said, this is a must see for people (not just  children) who have trouble coming to grips with any on a number of God given abilities.This film was much to good for the lack of popular appeal it experienced, and is far too good to let go by.

Thankfully, I viewed the movie again before making the recommendation because the language/sexual reference of the film is strong; not something I would feel comfortable recommending to underage students. But as a parent who feels the language is in context and appropriate for the message, I highly recommend the film (for PG-13 audiences as recommended).

An underprivileged youth is discovered by a reclusive genius and is shepherded to his full potential.  What GWH was to math, this film is to literature.  They are such close cousins that Van Sant felt compelled to bring in Matt Damon for a cameo.Regardless of the familiar plot, \"Finding Forrester\" succeeds because of an excellent screenplay and outstanding acting performances by Sean Connery, Rob Brown and F. Murray Abraham.  This kind of story can't help grabbing the audience at a human level.  Genius, suppressed by societal class, struggles to emerge and it beats the odds.  The story is transcendent for both the main characters.  Forrester (Sean Connery) helps Jamal (Rob Wallace) transcend his societal constraints to realize his potential as a writer, and Jamal helps Forrester to transcend the constraints of his emotional traumas to free him as a human being.  It is a triumphant story, very uplifting.Van Sant does a good job of presenting the human element and developing the characters while keeping the photography effective but in the background.  The photography is very straightforward, allowing the characters to tell the story without the intrusive use of stylish shots that are all to prevalent lately.  Van Sant gives Forrester's apartment a dark and dreary look from a color and lighting perspective, which is particularly effective.Sean Connery is in top form and continues to make the case for being one of our best and most treasured actors.  He gives a virtuoso performance in this film with a complex and ornery character.  It is a powerful and moving portrayal.  Rob Brown is phenomenal in his first feature film.  He was found in a talent search and made an impressive debut with an extremely mature performance.  With the right scripts, he has a good chance of having a bright future.  F. Murray Abraham is fantastic as the haughty English teacher, who gets his just deserts.This is a highly intelligent film with a strong story, steady direction and marvelous acting.  I rated it a 9/10.  Despite an all too familiar storyline, it differentiates itself by its wide-ranging excellence.

This film is a lot more than the skimming of black public high schools by white private high school to find the winning sportsmen they need. This film is a lot more than the story of a black teenager who finds his mentor, a father substitute since he has no father and his elder brother is not the model he wants, in a famous and yet totally marginal writer, Scottish by origin and bird-loving by choice and passion. This film is a lot more than the exacting tyrant a failed writer can become when he decides to compensate his failure in writing by becoming a creative writing and literature teacher. And this film is also a lot more than the phenomenal emotional shock it is for an aging man, diagnosed with cancer, entirely solitary and marginalized to find by accident and the insistence on the side of the foundling, the younger man who is going to be his follow-up next generation. He gets out of his cocoon. He gets out of his seclusion. Even so much that he will save his foundling from academic probation and even open up the door to his future. This film is all that together and a lot more. It is the story of loyalty, commitment and yet betrayal and salvation. Deeply emotional all along the film gets to a poignant ending when the death of the older man is announced by a lawyer to the younger man, and when this younger man is given the full legacy of the older man: the keys to the older man's den and sanctuary in the Bronx, a final farewell manuscript letter and the manuscript of his second and posthumous novel to be prefaced by the younger man. The racial problem is dealt with delicately but thoroughly showing how little race has to do with creative imagination, or even plain human love, but also that it has a lot to do with some preconceived ideas that a black basket ball player cannot be a creative writer of any excellence. A film to watch several times just for fun and emotional inspiration. You can always trace and track all the visual or situational allusions to many other films, like Matt Damon as a young lawyer.

The essay begins with a scene that is eerily similar to a scene from Finding Forrester. I recommend anyone that loves this movie get a copy Ralph's Collected Essays and check it out.  Like Ellison's Masterpiece--Invisible Man--the themes explored in Finding Forrester are, above all else, universal; you could replace any character with another character of any race or gender and it would still work.

Nonetheless, it still has its moments, like the jazzy background music that goes together well with the theme and process of writing. My favorite musical piece would have to be the bouncy number that plays when Sean Connery's reclusive character ventures out on his bicycle at night.

Forrest becomes Jamal's writing teacher, and helps him negotiate with the politics of Jamal's new private school and his conflict with teacher(Abraham).This movie was pleasant enough, stressing important themes such as the price of fame and expectations, the burdens of talent, and the ultimate importance of education.Watching this movie I was reminded too much of Van Zant's other old man/young man friendship film, Good Will Hunting.

He remains in the home of his youth, despite the fact that over time it has changed from a middle class white neighborhood into a overall low income area in which the Black families that live in the area are struggling just to get by.He meets a prodigy by the name of Jamaal, a young Black man who is in the prime of his High School career and is both a great athlete as he is a great writer. Jamaal suffers from what many other youth suffer from, he fears to be alienated simply because he is smart and enjoys literature.

Definitely worth seeing again and again."],["This is a movie which could have been great, but was good nonetheless. A refreshing change (and relief) from action adventure, teenagers in love, special effects, or comedy romance. Rob Brown, who played Jamal, was so natural that it is incredible to believe that this was his first ever acting role. Either he's a natural, or else he just played himself!! Sean Connery, wonderful as always...and it was nice, for another change of pace....However, the movie could have been great. Some of the moments were too cliched, and didn't need to be. Jamal losing the basketball game was a little bit much. That scene didn't even need to be in the movie. Also, I can't figure out why Forrester had to die. It made no sense. It could have ended right after the writing contest, when they say good-bye and Forrester takes off on his bicycle. And then maybe show his second book with the forward by Jamal...it just really annoyed me when they tack these...endings on for no reason at all. It nearly ruined the movie for me. And especially, when the lawyer told Jamal that Forrester had known for several years he had cancer--I thought the guy was a recluse and hadn't been out for the past 40 years. What did he do, have a hospital come to him? As far as I know, cancer usually can't be detected during a housecall...All in all, a good movie, and I recommend turning it off right after the writing contest and when Jamal and Forrester say good-bye."],["Amazing story line and performances by all in this film. Excellent film! Have seen it many times and gets better each time. Worth the watch."],["As you can tell by the first review, this movie has a plot extremely similar to the Karate Kid.  I found there were many unneeded scenes, which moved the plot at an extremely slow pace.  Jamal develops a friendship with a girl in his class, yet for all we know nothing comes out of this friendship.  Forrester obviously has a sort of psychological condition, but we find very little out about this as well. The film is somewhat distanced from the viewer, which does not work well for this film.  Great performances by Connery and the actor whom played Jamal, but overall, as Jamal might say: been there, seen that."],["this is an excellent movie...we haven't played the one we got from you , but assume it is in good shape....thanks"],["One of Sean Connery's best"],["I just like the movie and the actors.

Loved it!"],["I loved this movie, it was such a nice surprise. The young man I haven't seen in any other films, but I did recognize a young Anna Pacquin. Sean Connery was the best part of the film for me, thoroughly enjoyable."],["I really enjoyed this movie. I feel that both Sean Connery's and Rob Brown's performances were fantastic. The interactions between the two gave it a sense of originality while the concept of teacher student has been done an infinite number of times. However, the writers bit to deep into the formula in my mind.Here is the formula for writing a teacher-student story. First, you take intelligent and either misunderstood or misguided child. Make them a tad bit precocious intellectually. Then you take injured teacher. This injury can either be physical (like Mel Gibson's Man without a Face) or psychological (as agoraphobia is here). Then you put the youth in the unexpected pathway and viola drama ensues. Oh wait I forgot the key outcome. While the youth will succeed and learn, it is the injured teacher that is healed in the end.Great basic plot. You can write about a million of these, and perhaps they have. But, I think what frustrated me most was the insistent of the writers to digress into 60's &amp; 70's theme in a movie about a new generation. I think the fact the Brown character is a black youth from \"the `hood\" may be inspirational to some, I felt like it was trying to latch on to the boogie man of racism to make the film effective rather than developing strong characters. In addition, I found the use of the Paquin character a bit annoying on the same vein-Oh her daddy doesn't want her to date Jamal.There is so much potential here to make a good story relying on good character interplay... I think Good Will Hunting demonstrates that really well, where the hardship is derived from the characters' lives not from the use of oblique racial commentary. In fact, I feel cheated because it was the easy way in my mind because so much symbolism comes easy.I really liked this movie. The dialogue and the acting were really solid. I only wish the writers would have worked harder and looked beyond the skin color and into what makes people interact."],["it seems like half of the real movie was left on the cutting room floor. there are so many storylines that aren't fully developed, like jamal's relationships with his male peers, jamal's relationship with his love interest, the professor's jealousy with william, etc. that it's disappointing. as a result, it is like watching a half-hearted attempt to be meaningful."],["FINDING FORRESTER is a movie about 16-year-old Jamal Wallace (Rob Brown), a high school basketball star who has a secret passion, and a talent, for writing.

Before I saw this movie, I had the expectations that it was going to be the best film of the year, because of the hype surrounding it.  It was a let down by those standards, but most people will not be disappointed if they rent this movie.

It is to the point. No edge of your seat drama. No flashy costumes. The soundtrack is awesome. Over all it is a very inspiring film. All of the actors in it contributed enough to make the movie what it was. I enjoy the fact that there were no racial slurs or every other word a curse word. It was as my title put it. Elegant and Simple! Both the movie and Soundtrack are worth owning."],["A good movie if you don't have anything else to watch. Think Grand Turino meets Good Will Hunting, with basketball."],["In \"Finding Forrester\" you can find no better story!  Finding Forrester is just a wonderful, melodramatic tale that is told from the heart and is quite uplifting.  Sean Connery gives a stunning performance as an agoraphobic man devastated by personal loss.  Newcomer Rob Brown's performance as an extremely intelligent, but held back by his surroundings youth is nothing less than outstanding and Anna Paquin whose performance is right on with her usual high standards.The premise:  MINOR SPOILERThe main character played by Rob Brown is an extraordinarily intelligent sixteen year old living in the South Bronx.  As a dare, he is challenged to sneak into \"the man in the window's\" home and bring something out.  Connery scares him out of his home, causing him to leave behind his book bag with all of his stories in it.  After critiquing all of his work, Connery drops his book bag down on the street for him to recover.  What follows from this point is the development of an unlikely relationship between two people from entirely different worlds.

I had no idea what the movie would be about. I have looked for this movie on and off through the years.  Recently, I started my search again and was luck to find it.

But not so much because of any capricious flights of fancy, but rather because of the fascinating mix of one very bright inner-city youngster who wants desperately to belong, and one churlish and equally bright, but panicky, recluse who wants desperately to be left alone - or so they both thought.A marvelous tale that will probably make some English composition teachers cringe, and will reaffirm many students' suspicions that every school faculty has at least one pompous bigot begging to be dethroned.  But the story isn't some intellectual version of the never-ending marshal-arts genre.  Rather, &quot;Forrester&quot; is an enthralling story about two people separated by several generations and vastly different experiences, but symbiotically linked by their search to find out what they can accomplish with their uncommon talents, even if it requires each of them to stretch well beyond their comfort zones.&quot;Forrester&quot; is about growing up - as suffered at both the dawn and sunset of adulthood.  Superb - I'm well on the way to wearing out my tape."],["This is a heartwarming movie with fine performances by Sean Connery, newcomer Rob Brown, F. Murray Abraham, Michael Nouri, and Anna Pacquin. Well directed by Gus Van Sant, the film revolves around the two main characters, William Forrester, played by Sean Connery, and sixteen year old Kamal, played by Rob Brown.William Forrester is a writer who, battling his own inner demons, has remained reclusive after writing a Pulitzer Prize winning novel some forty odd years earlier. Living alone in a changing neighborhood in the Bronx, he makes the acquaintance of Kamal, an intellectually gifted inner city kid, who plays street basketball, loves to write, and does both well.A mentoring relationship springs between the two. Under Forrester's secret tutorship, Kamal blossoms. When Kamal's scholastic test scores come to the attention of a local prep school, school officials offer him a scholarship to attend and, if he chooses to do so, play basketball on the school team. The school also turns out to be William Forrester's alma mater, where he is revered and his prize winning novel is required reading.There, Kamal encounters rank racism, all the more insidious because it is covert. F. Murray Abraham plays a teacher who is very similar to the character, Salieri, whom Abraham portrayed in the film \"Amadeus\". A failed writer who became a teacher, Abraham oozes racism as he contrives to destroy Kamal whom he accuses of plagirism, as he clearly believes him to be just another inner city, black basketball player who is incapable of anything more. He cannot seem to fathom that this kid could possibly write as well as he does, because he has Kamal stereotyped.Yet, Kamal is actually all that he puports to be, a gifted writer who just also happens to play basketball. Truly scholarly, he shows up his teacher in class, only to further exacerbate his emnity. This teacher's dislike and covert racism manifests itself in the exclusion of Kamal's entry in the prestigious writing competition sponsored by the prep school. This situation comes to a head when the teacher's racism is exposed for what it is in a stunning, surprising climax.Kamal, however, is not the only one to have a moment of redemption in the movie. Forrester, too, has that moment as he comes to grips with his past, the past that made him shut the world out for so long. It is his friendship with Kamal that illuminates his return to the very world from which he had withdrawn long ago.This film is about a friendship that is borne out of a shared passion. It is about the old nurturing the young. It is about passing the baton from one generation to the next. It is a film the transcends age and race. It is a film for everyone."],["Excellent because this film incorporated excellent character development throughout; also because of the incredible inspiration this plot conveys to youngsters about achieving success without benefit of a wealthy family.

More than teaching, a mentor relationship is one in which both parties learn from each other, and each is sustained and made stronger by their bond with the other.No doubt, you think the veteran Sean Connery can portray this.  Long a leading man, recently a character actor, Connery, however you may like or dislike him as a star, is a consummate actor.  Rob Brown is a revelation; a 16 year old non-actor who has the utmost confidence in himself, and portrays it on the screen, both as his character, Jamal, and as a true partner to Connery in their shared scenes. It will be a shame if the industry does not find more roles for a youngster with such raw talent and screen presence.A quiet film that embraces both sport and literature, and brings to life many elements of the city of New York (although mostly filmed in Toronto!), FF will touch your mind and your heart.Many reviewers have compared it to &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot; and &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;, but it perhaps is ahead of them (Gus Van Sant  using hindsight?) in that there is so much texture to the simple life of Jamal before he encounters William Forrester, in his friendships, his family, his incredible thirst for knowledge through reading and writing, his love of hoops.  One feels that Jamal would have succeeded on almost any level without Forrester, and is only enriched by his encounter.  For Forrester however, it is life, rediscovered.A terrific cast, a fitting score and camerawork, with perhaps not enough special features to make it a top-drawer DVD, Finding Forrester is high on my short list of favorites for the year 2000.  A gem that will keep coming back into your mind, long after you have seen it.  See it."],["Although this movie didn't engage me as much as most of Connery's movies, I still enjoyed it, and he's still excellent as the crusty but reclusive writer who takes a brilliant young black kid under his wing and nurtures his writing talent. Rob Brown is also excellent in the role and surprisingly good since he is apparently a non-actor. The relationship that develops between the two unlikely friends grows out of their love of books and writing, and they come to like and respect each other despite the cultural and generational gap that exists between them. F. Murray Abraham is also great playing the villain as usual who wrongly attempts to get Rob expelled for an infraction, when Connery suddenly comes to his aid at the climax. This reminded me of the final scene in \"Scent of a Woman\" in which Al Pacino comes to the aid of Chris O'Donnell at his exclusive New England private school. A little piece of trivia--did anybody notice the ending music during the credits with the Jamaican steel drum band? It was the same music used during the credits in the Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek movie, Badlands, about two serial killers in South Dakota back in the 50's. I loved that music but have no idea about how to get ahold of it, and I was amazed to find it by chance in this movie. The only reason I don't give the movie more stars is that it just doesn't seem to get off the ground dramatically, but maybe I just don't appreciate the director's naturalistic, low-key style, since that could have been what he intended. Overall, however, it's still a good flick and worth seeing if you're a Connery fan like me."],["To me, a classic is something that you can watch and watch again no matter when without the story, the setting, the dialog, and the theme becoming tired and aged. This one fits my criteria completely.The ending, although conventional and without surprises, is still extremely uplifting and leaves you with a good feeling afterwards.The haunting mood of the sound track - hope among the hopeless - fits the movie hand in glove.You have to be an extremely cynical person not to like this movie."],["The fact that 'Finding Forrester' somewhat brings 'Good Will Hunting' to mind is not such a big coincidence, considering that Gus Van Sant was the director of both, with a very weird and unsuccessful project (the movie 'Psycho') in the middle. But Van Sant was careful enough to maintain things at a resemblance level, only picking up the best elements from his own masterpiece (in fact, more like the masterpiece of Matt Damon -who happens to play the minor role of a lawyer in this movie- and Ben Affleck, authors of the script). The script for 'Finding Forrester' instead puts out there the name of an amateur script writer and not-so-amateur News Director from Oregon: Mike Rich.The movie is centered in the Bronx, where a gifted high school student and neighborhood basketball star Jamal Wallace (played by young talent Rob Brown) begins an interesting friendship with a former literary star turned hermit, William Forrester (played by Sean Connery). The relationship between the very mature sixteen-year-old and the seventy-plus-year-old author evolves as Wallace earns the respect and trust of Forrester, as a result of the his brightness and candor, in the midst of a most adverse environment.As Wallace experiences the chance of a lifetime in the form of a scholarship to one of the most prestigious private high schools, he is faced with a human feeling he was not as used to in his poor Bronx: envy. The envy of another just-as-talented basketball player, and that of his bitter and not-so-brilliant literature teacher, Robert Crawford, notably played by F. Murray Abraham. Abraham is an actor that has already performed roles of this sort, such as Antonio Salieri in 'Amadeus' so you can guess that he does this extremely well.Connery's performance, as usual, was flawless, and so was Brown's. All these performances along with the script, one which deserves the highest praise, make very upsetting the fact that the movie went so unnoticed when it was playing in Theaters. This movie stands up there with 'Dead Poets Society' and 'Good Will Hunting', among the movies of its kind."],["Finding Forrester is a movie that is hard to categorize. I would say most of all it is about human relation ship and how an open mind to the unexpected can open the heart. Agoraphobic writer Forrester had locked himself up in his apartment and basically given up on life when he meets young James Wallace, to whom he can teach a lot but from whom he picks up a new lease on life, to the point that he wants to go back to his native Scotland to die. He then relates how this was the happiest period of his life, his Sunset, which is also the title of his second and final novel he leaves on his desk, unpublished, waiting for James to write a preface.It is also about hope in the face of seemingly unsurmountable odds, as James, a black from the Bronx destined for crime and a life in the streets, can use his intelligence, his basketball skills and not a little luck to make a real life for himself.The movie also says a lot about life in the Bronx (though things have improved there since) and about how elite American schools are ready to close an eye on academic performance to attract athletic talent in their recruitment process.This is the next to last appearance of Connery in a film before his retirement."],["If you've caught the trailer or read anything about this film, then you have probably already started guessing what the ending will be. But it's how the character's reach the story's end that is such a joy to watch unfold.  Comparisons with Good Will Hunting are hard to avoid, as again, the director has woven a tale of clever-boy, hiding his genius to fit in with his peers and a charismatic mentor bringing it out. However, as with G.W.H., it's the depth of characterisation that grips you, so that you don't really care about the predictability.  Buy this movie if you want to watch a perfectly paced and beautifully shot story where you're not really watching the clock wondering how much longer there is to go.  I'm repeating myself, but to sum up, Finding Forrester is a joy to watch."],["Finding Forrester is a story of friendship of two verydifferent people where they growed and changed forthe better because of this friendship.

Now here, same convincing, as Forrester, he acts a formerly admired writer, who has closed himself into his own library, walling off from the public because of the hard fate that stroke his family. Seeing only the part of the world in front of his small window, he seems to even get a bit arrogant and self-satisfied. Kind of patronizing he starts to teach a highly gifted young student the arts of writing and gives him the finishing touches. But very soon it shows up, that not only the old man is the teacher. In their meetings, the two of them have to learn from each other, they help each other to find themselves and the truth of life. Finally the old man comes back to reality.

Highly motivational.This is my first copy I keep losing it to students."],["It must be hard to do a successful movie about the literary world. For one thing, it's often such a cerebral subject, and movies demand action. Another problem is that a literate script is a prerequisite. Most movies today don't require this, which results in a lot of screen writers who are long on concept and short on verbal skills. Mike Rich, the man who wrote Finding Forrester, does have writing skills and manages to give us a story that is reasonably compelling. The movie falls short of greatness because it is too long and because the ending is a formula one. but it still manages to be touching and full of hope. It also has a unique view of what it is like to be an intelligent young black man in America that I found to be both interesting and enlightening.To his friends and fellow high school student, Jamal Wallace [Robert Brown] is just nice guy who is very good at basketball. He has secret life that he hides from them. He is an avid reader, and he is constantly writing in his journals. In an old third-story apartment overlooking the public basketball court where Jamal and his buddies play, there lives a recluse. They've never seen him, but they have caught him peering at them from a window. That's why they call him The Window. One day the guys dare Jamal to sneak into the apartment and steal a souvenir. He does this and is caught by The Window, who turns out to be old man. In fleeing, Jamal leaves his backpack behind. The next day he sees it hanging from the man's apartment window. He retrieves the backpack, and when he gets home, he discovers that the journals that were in it have been read. Passages have been marked indicating what the man did and did not like. This begins an extraordinary friendship. Later Jamal will discover that the man is Robert Forrester, a writer who published one novel, gained fame and the Pulitzer prize, and then suddenly vanished. Jamal, Forrester will conclude, has the ability to become a great writer, but will the boy, who is also capable of being a basketball star, have the courage to become one?Sean Connery sparkles as Forrester. He gives us a memorable character who discovers that there is still a spark of hope within his world-weariness. Robert Brown, who has never acted before, is a great find. His Jamal is street-smart, yet obviously worthy of a fuller life. F. Murray Abraham plays an English teacher who is a failed writer and, therefore, thinks Jamal's work is too good for the boy to have done it himself.Some reviewers have stated that Finding Forrester is unrealistic except in the basketball scenes In doing so, they have helped to prove one of the movie's major points. A subtle racial prejudice still exists, even among some of the most urbane and educated people. It implies that a major sports career is perfectly suitable for a bright young black man. Indeed, it is an acceptable and lucrative way to make a living, but that subtle prejudice whispers that that's the summit for a black man or woman, that to aspire for more is to expect too much. I don't believe that's true, and I thought the movie told a story that was entirely possible."],["Finding Forrester is a great movie. This movie teaches young adults how to embrace life and take whatever hits you. In Finding Forrester, 16 yr. old Jamal, goes to a private school called Mailor Callow; the best school on the east coast. But before leaving, Jamal and his buddies place a bet. This bet lands Jamal into a friendship with a special person, thats lasts forever. When this movie was made, the director was thinking of how to attract young adults in writing and where it can possibly get them in life. Finding Forrester is a movie made mainly for younger adults going through high school/college. The characters in this movie were very believable, because this movie shows what could actually happen to people all over the world. None of it is really fantasy at all. Every character in this movie did any excellent job. I don't think anyone could have done a better job. The moods and emotions in Finding Forrester are very subtle and calm. At times, the characters get a little emotional or excited, like during the basketball game or when Jamal's special friend reads the writings that Jamal wrote himself. The director also did an excellent job with this movie and also with the cast. He couldn't have chosen anyone better than what he had. I think the major theme of this movie is &quot;live with what you have, it may be the only thing left in your life.&quot; I request this movie for you and i'm sure you will enjoy it!"],["Outstanding performances combine to make this a feel-good, learn-about-yourself-and-others story with incredible music to match.

It proves that even though you are lettered in a field , you should remain somewhat humble or you could end up eating humble pie."],["The stars are for Rob Brown's exciting performance as Jamal Wallace, and for the jazz on the soundtrack. This is a well-made movie marred by massive reliance on cliche, and an abundance of plot holes. The biggest plot hole -- why is William Forrester's novel so beloved? We really aren't shown or told, and it seems like the screenwriter is relying on the viewer identifying Forrester's work with The Catcher in the Rye. Also, Forrester's writing lesson is ridiculous. He basically tells Jamal to type anything, and let that stand as a first draft. Forrester's &quot;advice&quot; is, of course, a paraphrase of Truman Capote's put-down of Jack Kerouac's method. It's just laughable to have Hollywood enshrine a withering put-down as the model of good writing. The romantic subplot between Jamal and Anna Paquin's character is undernourished and stunted. F. Murray Abraham is OK, but the denouement is a hideous and cliched set piece."],["After finally seeing this movie on TV, I thought this was such a good story that I wanted it as part of my DVD library.

A kid from a rough neighborhood and an old man with former ambitions meet and both their lives are completely turned around. The boy realizes that he is smarter then his former bad grades let on and the old man learns that he can still find a life past his recent failures. Good Will Hunting, right? Well, yes, but it is also the basic premise for Finding Forrester. Though the story is tweaked a bit and toned down from the R-rated Hunting, Forrester does come off as being a little too familiar, being released around three years after the Miramax feature, but can the similarities really hurt it? In actuality, not really. There have been plenty of Dead Poet Society knock-offs that have made pretty decent coin at the box office in recent years but none of them equal the quality of the original. So in essence there is both a good side as well as a bad side to this situation. Can Forrester break this trend? History is against the film but Connery is pretty select on his choice of scripts, so there is at least some hope for it.The story is pretty much the same as Good Will Hunting minus the witty charm of Ben Affleck and Robin Williams. William Forrester, a vibrant writer from New York, wrote the great American novel nearly four decades ago but ever since then he has basically vanished from the face of the earth. Or so many people thought. A sixteen year old student named Jamal Wallace meets up with the famous author when he breaks into his apartment one night and leaves his backpack behind. Jamal is amazed to find that his writings are returned with corrections made to the documents. When Mr. Wallace is accepted to an elite Manhattan prep school, he returns to the old recluse seeking help and inspiration for writing. After some time Mr. Forrester agrees but on two conditions: Jamal can not tell anyone about the whereabouts of William Forrester and no questions on why he only wrote one book. As time goes on they begin to look beyond the stereotypes they once believed and teach each other something about life. The story for Finding Forrester is quite well done despite borrowing several influences from the previously mentioned Good Will Hunting. If you are literature buff then you will greatly enjoy some of mentioned works in the film. If you're not then you will find the several scenes a bit confusing but your overall experience shouldn't be greatly affected.Though the cast is a relative bunch of no names, the leading roles, for the most part, perform exceedingly well. Sean Connery shows that he can still act off much younger co-stars amazingly well as he does with Rob Brown. Connery really showcases a former writer who had enough of what society thought his book was about and sunk into a deep depression especially after the loss of the several members of his family. The most enchanting scenes with the veteran actor have to be him riding his bicycle through the streets of New York. It seems so awkward that it becomes quite charming and heart-warming to witness in this feature. Rob Brown, as ill experienced as he may be, does a wonderful job considering he is performing opposite one of the prominent veteran actors of our time. One of the few flaws in the film has to be the character played by Anna Paquin, who recently appeared in the summer hit, X-Men. It has nothing to do with the performance, Paquin did an excellent job with the material that was given to her, but has rather to do with the character itself. The film suggests a growing romantic relationship between her and Brown's character but once the main premise of the feature rises to its climax, the whole romantic side story disappears completely.Overall, Finding Forrester managed to do what many of its predecessors couldn't by actually being entertaining despite borrowing several elements from critically-acclaimed Good Will Hunting. One those borrowed elements would have to be the talented actor Matt Damon, who cameos as Mr. Forrester's lawyer near the end of the feature. The timing and way the scene was handled made the cameo quite a delight considering thoughts of Hunting had to be on the minds of many movie-goers. The few problems with feature would have to include the longer then needed time length and some side stories including the romantic relationship between two characters that aren't explored fully in the film. Outside of those small complaints, Finding Forrester succeeds at being quite an entertaining romp despite feeling all too familiar to movie-goers. Not as entertaining as Good Will Hunting but it can be said that filmmakers never intended that to happen."],["Finding Forrester is a movie that shows how brilliance can come from anywhere.  The movie stars the famous British actor Sean  Connery and newcomer Rob Brown, who acts marvelously for his first movie.  The movie is about a child prodigy whose brilliance is discovered and he is sent away from everyone he knows and placed in a private school where he doesn't belong.  Here he is met with false prejudices and controversy.  Only by meeting Sean Connery, a famous novelist who has become a hermit, does Rob Brown, who plays Jamal Wallace, find answers to his life.  Throughout the movie, Jamal Wallace has to deal with internal and external conflicts.  He is torn between being the person he was in the past or to succeed and find greatness through his writing skills. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Whenever you find a movie where Sean Connery swears, drinks, and even yells &quot;you the man now dog&quot;, you just have to watch it.  The movie is heartfelt without having to have a love story in it, which, is prevelent in today's movies.  Finding Forrester is a movie that makes you realize the importance of finding your dreams and reaching for them now matter how old you are or how your life has been."],["In an era of movies laden with heavy background music, violence, conflict . .where physical aggression triumphs over guile and intelligence, FINDING FORRESTER is truly a breath of fresh air. Sean Connery plays the aging academic/ writer recluse beautifully . .his achilles heel is dealing with today's changed world and society's aggressive &quot;loudness&quot; . .his young counterpart the opposite- uncomfortable with his academic and deeply insightful interpretive abilities of life- he retreats to the role of the rap listening, basketball junkie. Through a chance encounter, the two become friends- resspecting one and other and bringing each other out of their shells. Surprise twists and lots of &quot;warm fuzzy&quot; moments make this one of the decade's best feel good movies- a must see for children who feel akward about their God given academic abilities- almost a parenting aid that rivals positive reaffirmation of child therapists . . and just plain a nice feel good movie. Enjoy !!!"],["\"Finding Forester\" starts with a shot of a clapperboard, clearly showing director Gus Van Sant's name and the title of his movie.  Right away, the fact that this is a make-believe story is brought to the audience's attention.  Couple this with the liberal use of the song `Over the Rainbow' -- the most famous movie song about ideal, make-believe worlds  -- and I got the distinct impression that Van Sant was trying to make excuses for this maudlin, almost cliched narrative.  \"Watch me undermine my own Hollywood film,\" he appears to be saying.  \"It may be trite, but at least I know that it's trite.  Forgive me, please.\"Whatever, Gus.  You protest too much.  I still liked your film.The buzz on this movie is that it's nothing more than \"Good Will Hunting II\" (Van Sant recognizes this fact, with an obvious and unintentionally hilarious \"GWH\" reference in the film's epilogue).  I agree that it shares some cosmetic qualities with that film (bearded mentor counsels brilliant but troubled young man, against a background of poverty and academia), but \"Forester\" has enough unique qualities that the comparison becomes unnecessary.  First, the prodigy's genius is in his writing, and not in numbers.  It's a more dangerous proposition, because while most people wouldn't recognize a flawed mathematical equation, we can all spot bad writing.  Van Sant knows this, and tries to keep the examples of William Forester's and Jamal Wallace's writing hidden.  A wise move, because when we are finally exposed to them, it's quite dreadful.While the narrative moved forward with powerful (and often contrived) thrust, the movie felt overlong.  I noticed many sequences composed of purely visual montages that felt overlong by half.  I think Van Sant could have used the services of a more judicious editor.  He seemed to fall in love with the images of New York's streets and its inhabitants.  That's fine for setting up the context of the story, but should have been abandoned once the story got going.The acting, overall, was a mixed bag.  F. Murray Abraham as the villain professor was way over-the-top.  Sure, he was menacing, but with no real substance to back it up.  Anna Paquin as the love interest showed considerable charm and eccentricity, but her role was little more than a device.  She's a two-dimensional character at best.  Busta Rhymes as Jamal's older and wiser brother, has charisma to burn.  But the man is not a good actor.  He's at his best in a scene at the dinner table, when he breaks out in a spontaneous rap about his job as a parking attendant.  In smaller parts, Michael Nouri (as a wealthy alumnus) and the man who played the basketball coach were both horrible and distracting.  Thankfully, these performances don't distract from the powerful leads.Sean Connery is not a great actor.  He has not the depth and subtlety that the job requires.  But he is a star, and shows why here.  His William Forester chomps scenery as if it were saltines, dwarfing everyone around him.  And I could listen to Connery read the phone book, with that addictive Scottish accent of his.  He's perfect as the boozing J.D. Salinger-esque recluse, a man who can dominate a room by just raising one of his disheveled eyebrows.Ron Brown is a revelation as the young prodigy who comes to Forester for guidance.  He is a perfect contrast to Connery.  He never tries to do too much, is always composed, coiled, contained, and charismatic.  And oh yeah: he's utterly believable.  I've heard it said that this young man, with gifts of genius on the basketball court and at the typewriter, was just too much to believe.  Well, I believed it.  And I give full credit to Brown, who's asked to carry the movie his first time out, and never drops the ball."],["I enjoyed the movie.

To many people Forrester's life remains somewhat of a mystery, that changes for Jamal Wallace (Brown) when he stumble's across Forrester's hiding place due to a dare by his friends. However that dare will change both Jamal's and Forrester's lives. As Forrester helps Jamal in bringing out his writing talents and both show each other two very different aspects of the world. Finding Forrester is one of the best dramas I have ever seen. Though its not a fast paced drama, that really doesn't matter because everything else in the film was implemented perfectly. Sean Connery does an incredible job as Forrester and is flawless throughout. This is one of Connery's most powerful performances. The star power and experienced acting of Connery didn't suppress newcomer Rob Brown who played Jamal. This was Rob Brown's first film and even before being cast he had no acting experience whatsoever. The performance that Brown puts on could fool anybody into thinking he has had some experience in the past, this young talent may just be a natural actor. Guess this film brought out a hidden talent of his. Busta Rhymes also stars in this drama and he actually isn't bad as Jamal's brother or friend, not exactly sure which one.

He stays couped up in his apartment, until one eventful night he has a visiter that helps turn William's and Jamal's life around.  There are also many other people in this story that make Jamal fall in love and William realize that there is a life outside his apartment.  Sean Connery does not want anyone to know his life story or why he did not write another book, but Rob Brown helps him over come his stubbornness.This is a great movie for people who love to watch movies with slow beginnings and faster endings.  It is a wonderful movie with romance, basketball, and books.  These two men help each other throughout the film, even though they may not know it till the end.  The story involves characters that seem pretty real, by how they are brought up and how they are stereotyped.  They take over the film by how they make jokes and by how they help each other get over their fears.  Some parts of the movie are kind of different, but all in all the film comes across as young boys at school play pranks and how everything turns out better, if you work at it hard.  Sean Connery and Rob Brown make a relationship that was like father and son, that could last forever."],["This is a brilliant movie, I watch it about once a year.

I found myself completely engrossed in the film from the start, and it was all I could think about when it was stopped midway through at the end of the first part of the presentation.  After watching the rest, I remember thinking of Finding Forrester as one of those few movies done so well that it could have been a perfect rendition of a true story, even if it wasn't.  What it was was a touching and thoughtful film, one that didn't need special effects and such to bring about its success.  Sean Connery and Rob Brown complemented each other very well as the movie progressed, and I hope to see Brown step off from his first movie into a possible acting career.I would also like to say this: If you are one of the people who feels the need to deride and downplay this film because of its similarity to Good Will Hunting and other films, you are ignorant and short-sighted (and there's plenty of you on this site).  Hey, I can only go where the evidence leads me.  Movies, in my opinion, are made to be enjoyed, not judged in relation to other films.  If you do that, you shouldn't be writing movie reviews, whether you are an individual who went to the theater or a professional movie reviewer (and sometimes, even in that case, the reviewer doesn't have a clue).Finding Forrester is a statement about life, and that sometimes the way we see it isn't always right: the fact that an urban hoops-shooting black 16-year-old male could actually be something other than the common stereotype, a real writer with real talent.  Forrester helped him break free and show the world his gift.  It's a good story, not, like many of you believe, a stab at a \"cheap Oscar.\"  But it did deserve one.-Nick Lauria"],["This movie was the best movie ever, it all depends on what type of things you are into.

I'd definitely recommend itTruly a great film!"],["Really great.  Sean Connery plays an agoraphobic recluse-writer a la J.D. Salinger who has been holing up in his seventh-floor apartment in the Bronx and living off the royalties from his sole novel, a Pulitzer Prize-winner.

He is also an avid birdwatcher with binoculars, which he also uses to watch local youths playing basketball in front of their public housing apartment towers.One of the kids, Jamal, sneaks into his apartment on a dare from the other guys and leaves behind his backpack, containing the journals in which he has secretly been writing.  Connery dumps the backpackout of the window, containing his red pencilled teacherly corrections(\"Constipated writing!\") and a mentoring relationship on both sides ensues.If you haven't seen this 2000 movie, rent it and I think you'll enjoy it.It's rated PG-13 for some bad language and two scenes where Jamal enduresloud lovemaking sounds from the neighbors through his paper-thin apartment walls, but otherwise a great family movie to watch with older kids."],["'Finding Forrester' is a well done, in many ways very sensitive film, a relief compared to earlier productions with similar themes.Some reviewers have critised that there is a stereotyping of racial identities in this film. I think stereotypes are entirely inevitable. I can't think of one single mainstream production devoid of them -- it is almost a natural defect inherent to mainstream cultural analysis. Personally I don't believe stereotypes have spoilt 'Finding Forrester', but I agree that an additional dose of realism would have enriched the film.The first 'half' of the film is very carefully done. The camera work, the music -- for once not a double symphony orchestra --, Connery and Brown all contribute to create an atmosphere of great subtlety and truth (more than reality). There is also a very broad build-up thematically. Many issues are touched upon, in some cases with extraordinary care: race relations, teenage integration, boy-girl love, artistic frustration, social disadvantage, to name but a few.When Jamal enters the writing contest at his elite school, the film takes an abrupt turn. Here we really fall into mainstream Hollywood clich&eacute;s, that remind of 'Good Will Hunting' to an embarassing extent. Most of the careful build-up is completely lost when Forrester comes to save Jamal from Prof. Crawford. It fits badly that the text Forrester presents at the occasion is covered up by soapy music and cheap camera work. Indeed, it almost seems that the script-writer ran out of ideas for a good text! A quiet reading of a short, but pointed essay would have fit much better than the bloated scene we have. It would have made the approach to the final victory, the mentor saving the student, and hence overcoming his own problems, far more realistic. It would also have shown more continuity in the film. Moreover, many of the themes that were touched upon in the first part of the movie did not find any echoes in the end, and were left unconcluded.It is possible that the producers feared the film would have been too long, and above all, lost its mainstream appeal, had they continued on the lines of the build-up. A great shame -- without this lack of courage, 'Finding Forrester' would have made an exceptional motion picture and a masterpiece of acting as well.Nonetheless, it remains a powerful film, and should be seen, even if the final and concluding sequences are weak. It also shows how much further beyond 'Good Will Hunting' a production on this theme can go. 'Finding Forrester' points in the right direction.

Let's wait and see how he grows, possibly also on stage as well as on camera, to see if he's really worthy to be called an actor. F. Murray Abraham does a good job, but doing what? What he has always been doing, the bad, sadistic and twistedly jealous mentor. Wouldn't it be refreshing to see him do something totally whacky just for once? I felt he was wasted once again by the movie machinery...Connery is always good in whatever he does, but at times this bothers me, because he could do much better still. In this one, produced by him, he rather prefers to lean back and watch others work. I simply can't see him as a weak character. His true stamina and adrenalin is always overcooking. I could've seen an older William Hurt playing Forrester, but Connery? He has too much power and life in him that simmers through every pore of his skin to be a poor, isolated, secluded and frustrated writer.He was far better in &quot;The Rock&quot; and in &quot;Entrapment&quot; than in this high-minded intellectual work.

Rob Brown, who plays him, is utterly miscast and emanates a deep and sullen dullness in a role that needed a character capable of hinting at essential brilliance, concealed beneath an unpromising and protective exterior. To me the unpromising exterior remains intact for the duration.Connery, as usual, shows his versatility, but I don't see this as even near his best work - he seems not to have his heart in it and I can't blame him. Jamal, by the way, since he checked the professor's use of 'farther' when he should have used 'further' might have usefully caught out the erudite Forrester using 'phenomena' when he meant 'phenomenon'!

William Forrester played by Sean Connery is an eccentric novelist with ill-tempered manners but a compassionate and well-depth person that ideally can be considered as a true mentor. Rob Brown is a newcomer actor who played Jamal Wallace, an Afro-American gifted-person in writings who at the same excels in basketball game. His performance was fair enough in giving justice to his character however, it is much better if he gives more 'life' or an 'emotional magic' to some scenes that needed most. I don't want him to be ultra-emotional but a little bit of stress of feelings to his character may somehow move the viewers.Sean Connery gave a brilliant performance to his character, he really personified what a novelist is, giving also justice to the fears and hopes of a novelist which he strongly portrayed. He showed us a picture (somehow) of how life can be for a novelist who after the fame of receiving Pulitzer-award...what comes next? what will the future will bring me to? how far i should be like this?---questions we sometimes asks in ourselves especially in our mid-life stage.

Because of this film, I even like more Sean Connery as a well-deserved respect as an actor. Truly a brilliant actor. But the essence of this movie is all about friendship...if you are expecting to be a 'glorious' 'triumphant' movie at the end which the hero won in a contest or something...you better not expect that although there is a contest in the movie but it is not much emphasized or gave too much focus but the mutual friendship of both main characters. Integirty became a vital ingredient and important gem of the story. Integrity that keeps friendship so strong and lasts forever till the end. It happend to William Forrester and Jamal Wallace. This movie truly teach you the importance of Integrity in a friendship. A plus also in this movie, is the soundtrack...r&b; is the theme which fits actually in the setting of this film. I love to hear all over again the themesong 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' and 'What a Wonderful World' which was beautifully done in acoustic manner.Brilliant casts...outstanding performance...very good scripting...I hope you'll find it too when you watch 'Finding Forrester'..."],["For anyone who has felt out of place or anyone who has wanted more, you should see this film. For anyone who has been touched by special teacher or a special student, you should see this film. Van Sant does a fine job of placing you behind the eyes of Jamal. By the end of the film, you feel like calling your favorite teacher and thanking them for inspiring you to reach for more. Thanks Gus, for making this film"],["An above average film about a gifted young man from the Bronx who draws inspiration from a reclusive author.There are several elements which could have been overdone in this film: prejudice, class differences, breaking out from poverty, isolation.  But the film is really about the friendship which develops between Jamal and Forrester, and how it changes both of their lives.  Had the film tried to develop everything else, it would have lost this principal focus, and much of its impact.Sean Connery does a masterful job, as always, and Rob Brown as Jamal is a natural.  Anna Paquin is charming, as is the chemistry between her character and Jamal.A bit less sentimental than &quot;Good Will Hunting,&quot; if you liked that film, you will like this one.  If you don't like films that don't have a lot of action, avoid this film.  I have always said that character development makes or breaks a film, and this film develops its characters superbly.The music, though different than you might expect from a typical Hollywood production, is excellent and fits the movie well.  Smoky jazz/blues, moody in some places, playful in others.  I especially liked the jazz guitar rendition of &quot;Somewhere, Over the Rainbow.&quot;A final note:  If you have a DVD player, you might want to try the DVD edition.  The camera work is VERY tight, and my wife and I both felt that a lot of the scenes were being cut off by the &quot;pan and scan.&quot; We found this distracting, so we feel that this movie is probably best viewed &quot;widescreen.&quot;"],["One of the goals of the screenwriter and director is to evoke emotions from the viewer, and a good movie goes so far, as the late syndicated columnist Darrell Sifford once described to me,  as to &quot;milk the human tear duct.&quot;But finding Forrester went further. It brought out an emotional experience which was possibly new to me, and that is an extraordinary experience.It was enough to start off with a cast including Sean Connery, Anna Paquin, F. Murray Abraham,  Busta Rhymes, and a surprise, but un-named Oscar winner. And, as a writer, I was hoping, having seen the trailers, that this would be a good story. I had no idea it would lift me to new heights.The new fresh blood in the movie is first time actor, Rob Brown, a native of Harlem, who, is the youthful half of the Young Genius, Mentor Genius relationship, around which the story revolves.  I am one movie goer who enjoys a good tear-jerker. Movies which artfully and intelligently, lightly and subtely touch the heart are special works of magic. It was no small wonder to discover, within myself,  as this precious movie  was gradually unfolding, that my lower lip started to quiver. I tried to stop it, and then, like a light bulb, illuminating a dark room, only to discover myself in a museum with a never before seen masterpiece, I realized this quivering lip was beyond tear drops, beyond the moist eye most good scripts evoke. I touched my fingertip to my quivering lip. Little babies and toddlers lips quiver.  I smiled, and pointed my attention back to the screen, letting the script do its magic. And more magic it did!Finding Forrester is an extraordinary film which blends rap with classical literature,  basketball and baseball and racism and pedantism into a STORY which builds into a masterpiece which, at some point, begins to go beyond &quot;milking the human tear duct,&quot; to playing whole symphonies on your heartstrings.While it is rated PG,  primarily because of a few choice words, it is overall a good movie for that hard to satisfy 9-13 year old group. My 10 year old gave an unqualified &quot;good&quot; rating, which, considering he generally describes even his favorites as &quot;okay&quot;, is a dramatic endorsement. So did my 17 year old, who usually just flat out refuses to go to see any movie."],["My very favorite movie of all time is &quot;Good Will Hunting.&quot; That is an example of a film where the writing, acting, and directing clicked so perfectly to create a modern film masterpiece. The story was heartfelt and, although touching, was not too mushy or sentimental as to turn off male viewers.  Now why did I mention &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; in a review of &quot;Finding Forrester&quot;? The reason is simple: In many respects, &quot;Finding Forrester&quot; and &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; are the same movie. And that doesn't even factor in the facts that Gus Van Sant directed both movies, and that Matt Damon, the star of &quot;Good Will,&quot; has a cameo near the end of this film. Look at the similarities: Both films tell the tales of underpriveleged young men who have minds that are so brilliant it would seem impossible that they could have come from the meager backgrounds from which they did. Both male leads have friends or brothers who recognize their talent and do not want them to squander it by remaining at their current station in life. Both men become befriended by older men who are also stuck at a dead end in their lives. Through various meetings, the older men help the younger men reach their potentials, just as the younger men help them realize that they could still have great lives if they break out of the shells they created for themselves. &quot;Finding Forrester&quot; is definitely a beautiful film. It is set apart by Sean Connery's brilliant performance and his easy interaction with the young actor who plays Jamal. Their friendship is a really beautiful story. Unfortunately, the film as a whole is inferior when compared to &quot;Good Will Hunting.&quot; Although Anna Paquin is wonderful as Jamal's love interest, their relationship is never as interesting as the complex and multilayered one Will had with Skyler. Also, &quot;Forrester's&quot; characters fit too much into set cliches much more than the very original ideas of &quot;Hunting&quot;.  Old colleagues/enemies occur in both. The difference is Forrester dislikes Jamal's teacher based on his writings, although he never met him. Sean, from &quot;Hunting&quot; has an old personal relationship with Will's teacher that is intriguing in its blend of friendship and animosity. Also, the bottom line for me is Jamal is just not as interesting as Will. Maybe he would have been if he came first, but he just doesn't seem to have the personality and fire in life that Will does. On one level, all these similarities do not matter, though. The film really is beautiful and even reaches brilliance in many areas, but unfortunately its similarities to &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; are so overwhelming that it seems as times that the only differences is the color of Jamal's skin. Compare Jamal's talk to the racist white man in the BMW and Will's famous &quot;How do ya like them apples&quot; speech, and you'll see they're really the same scene. The subtext might be different, but both are based on brilliant people breaking down others assumptions of them based on outward appearances. If only this movie had taken a different direction and been more original, I could have said it had shades of &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; but didn't copy it completely linearly. Unfortunately, that's not true."],["Sean Connery at his finest.  Every time Mr. Connery is paired with a gifted, less well known actor he seems to bring out the best in both of them and Finding Forrester is no exception.  F.

Very good story."],["Sean Connery is the enigmatic William Forrester, a brilliant though troubled writer turned recluse after releasing a single literary masterpiece, \"Avalon Rising\".  (Famous hermit Salinger published far more - Forrester's literary contributions, beyond his novel, include periodical ramblings to mags like the New Yorker) Fearing attention, Forrester lives under an assumed name in a dessicated apartment, and frustrates those who would survey his work by dangling the prospect of a second book.  Newcomer Rob Brown (supposedly he auditioned for a bit part) is Jamel Wallace, local boy, b-ball maestro and burgeoning writer.  Not recognizing the hermit as Forrester, Jamel nevertheless turns to reclusive scot for help in his writing.  The need becomes more pronounced when Jamel's writing (and his court magic) gets him a scholarship to an upper-crust prep school.  Forrester nurtures Wallace's prose (Write from the heart first, then the head, Forrester advises) while Wallace returns the favor by drawing Wallace out of his shell and preserving the genius's privacy.  While at school, Wallace develops his writing under the eye of the Nefarious Professor Crawford (F. Murray Abraham).  With Crawford's earlier attempt at publishing thwarted by Forrester ages ago, the professor works his anger out by tyrannizing his wimpy students.  To Crawford, a disparity between Jamel's writing and background raises suspicions.  Jamel's refusal to conform only spurs Crawford further until the vindictive teacher can show a pattern between Jamel's writing and obscure works by Forrester.Though Director Gus Van Sant gets some good work from his leads, quality performances and deft direction don't rise above a thin and trite story.  We know that Forrester hides in his shell for a reason and that Wallace will find someway to ease his pain.  We also know that a confrontation between the evil Crawford and Wallace is inevitable.  Crawford is incredibly underwritten, like the villain of some action movie - you know he's going to get what's coming to him.  He's a bitter bully and a coward.  Worse is the school, the sort of stuffy place of learning we've seen in \"Dead Poets Society\" and \"Scent of a Woman\", the sort of tradition-bound citadel ruled by old money and populated by craven white males.  (The school falls even below this standard - though on academic probation, the school avails itself of Jamel's court skills, and even dangles the prospect of a reprieve, and you've got to wonder what respectable establishment would tolerate as openly a tyrannical, apparently bigoted and not obviously unsuccessful figure like Crawford).  The story doesn't do anything to beef up the school, which is populated by weasels cowering before the faculty.  There are none of the priceless supporting characters you had in \"Good Will Hunting\", and Busta-Rhymes is wasted as Jamel's older brother.  Though the film is about writing, the script barely treats itself as such, and there are only few lines with Forrester and Jamel jousting on the craft of prose and narrative.  I'd suggest \"Wonderboys\" instead."],["I had never heard of this movie until it was given to me this past Christmas.

The obvious difference, of course, is that the wunderkind in this film is black.Perhaps that would have been enough of a twist to save this film but, alas, all the familiar stereotypes were used--black kid is a menace who will steal a BMW; black kid will excel only on the basketball court; black kid who achieves great things in a classroom must be cheating or plagiorizing. This angle of the story was unfortunately predictable and dull.I wanted to like the movie but it had too much of the same flavor as GWH (I was surprised to learn both were directed by van Sant because one would think he'd stay away from twin films like this) and seemed wholly unoriginal.

So smoothly in fact that you don't really realize how many cardboard characters are smooshed in -- a spent-up reclusive J.D.

Murray Abraham (Amadeus,Star Trek: Insurrection) gives a delightful and memorable cameo in the film."],["Finding Forrester is a good movie that might have been great had it not attempted to be all things to all audiences.Jamal Wallace, well-acted by new comer Robert Brown, is an exceptionally bright, highly athletic, African-American student trying to hide his love of reading so as not to offend his less achieving friends.  Wallace makes a great sympathetic hero living in a very friendly version of the Bronx in which people can safely walk the streets at night.By a somewhat implausible but very acceptable twist, Jamal's friends dare him to break into the apartment of a strange recluse who turns out to be Sean Connery.Don't look for any traces of James Bond in this performance.  Connery may have some silly lines, but any accusations of playing this part as if still in her majesty's secret service are simply wrong.Connery is William Forrester, a reclusive writer, a Salinger-esque writer who published one novel accepted his Pulitzer and disappeared.  And by another implausible yet entertaining twist, Connery discovers that Jamal is an aspiring writer.  The two become friends, they bond, and grow.All of this is entirely implausible, but entertaining--a welcomed relief considering most of the other movies that have come out this year.But then things fall apart.  Jamal is accepted into a private school for his great test scores--he never showed his abilities in class to keep cool but let fly on an apptitude test.  Suddenly we are treated to a School Ties scenario with street-smart Jamal having to prove himself to the wealthy kids on his basketball team.  Then there is Finding Forrester the remake of One-on-One.  In these parts the movie has long basketball sequences that are well enough made, but distract from the theme of the literary theme.Finding Forrester also has a budding romance.  Jamal and one of the wealthiest girls in the school fall in like.  The movie never explores this relationship, but it's there in case you want it.Finally, there is the evil teacher, familiarly played by Murray Abrahams of Amadeus fame.  Abrahams acting is fine, but his role is entirely predictable.So here's how Finding Forrester rates in each of its many faces:Finding Forrester the buddy flick--5 stars Finding Forrester the gheto expose--2 stars Finding Forrester the School Ties film--2 stars Finding Forrester the basketball movie--3 stars Finding Forrester the romance--1 star Finding Forrester the evil teacher movie--4 starsPut 'em all together and what do you get?

It's about friendship, trust and being a good mentor. You will like this movie I guarantee it."],["Even without its cheekily reminiscent title, or the involvement of Gus Van Sant and Matt Damon, this film was always going to be a poor relation to 'Good Will Hunting'. At one point writer Mike Rich has Forrester tell Jamal that one can kick start the writing process by beginning with someone else's work: start by rewriting it, and when you find your own voice, let it takeover. Perhaps this is what Rich did with Damon and Affleck's script. While the parallels are remarkable, the film that results isn't.  The premise is virtually identical: a dazzlingly talented kid from the wrong side of the tracks enters into a relationship with an older man, and both learn and grow from the experience. Now there's nothing wrong with telling this story again (Damon and Affleck were hardly the first to do so) as long as it's told well. But 'Finding Forrester' isn't. It lacks a crucial element that makes 'Good Will Hunting' so marvellous. That film is driven by a strong central conflict: Will does not want to spend time with Sean and resents the interference of him and other authority figures in his life. He only gradually comes around to admitting his core emotional problem and, in doing so, drags Sean and Gerald into the light with him. In 'Finding Forrester', Jamal wants to spend time with Forrester and, after a few early quibbles, Forrester is only too delighted to help him. There is no conflict here. Jamal falls out of favor with his new teacher, certainly, and there is a minor rivalry with another student on the basketball team, but these are secondary to the central relationship of the film and seem to have been superimposed to add some spark. That central relationship needs to be the emotional powerhouse it was in 'Good Will Hunting', but it just isn't. The result is a story that drags and dawdles along to its pleasant and inspiring though gratingly obvious conclusion: Jamal finds his voice, Forrester regains his.  To be fair, this predictability wasn't helped by a stirring preview which gave away every key story moment (save the redundant epilogue). Hollywood marketers are going to have to do better than this if they want to continue to rely on their most effective advertising medium: word of mouth."],["I think I expected a little more from this Gus Van Sant directed movie.  There were tons of similiarities between this and Good Will Hunting (troubled young man taken under wing by brilliant tutor) though there's a little more role reversal here (the student helps the teacher at least as much).  As if to remind you that this is a variation on the Will Hunting theme, Matt Damon even shows up in a cameo.  The movie is shot much like Good Will Hunting as well -- those sweeping shots of the teacher's bookshelves look a lot like the ones of Will's bookshelves at the beginning of the movie.But I enjoyed the story if for no other reasons than the performances.  Connery was appropriately gruff but lovable, and the newcomer (whose name I forget -- probably because he hasn't done anything big since) was wonderfully subtle.  Rent this if you've already seen Good Will Hunting and looking for more on that troubled kid/helpful mentor theme.

Buy the soundtrack even if you only rent the movie."],["I think I have only commented on one other movie, and it was done to illustrate how to take a Pulitzer Prize winning book and turn it into swill. \"Finding Forrester\", was a brilliant film and a breath of fresh air from Hollywood's production line of big budgeted films, with stars with egos and paychecks that are even more ludicrous, and special effects that fill-in for plot, and for acting, and actors.Mr. Sean Connery is a rare treasure in so much as time continues he seems almost immune to it. His films have consistently won him the recognition he deserved once he stepped down from the James Bond Series. Nothing wrong with Bond, but the films are just not taken seriously by the \"exalted\" film critics.First a correction that needs to be made is that the fictional character of Forrester may have chosen a reclusive lifestyle after he wrote a Pulitzer Novel, however to compare him with Author J. D. Salinger is to either admit a person has not seen the movie, or who's knowledge of Salinger is non existent. That are plenty of biographies out there about Salinger and a quick glimpse will show the differences that make a comparison between the fictionalized character Forrester and Salinger to be absurd. To suggest a comparison between this and, \"Karate Kid\" films is to parade one's stupidity.So what did this film offer, not one or two, but three Academy Award Winners, and a brand new talent that was at least deserving of a nomination? The man who brought us Salieri in \"Amadeus\", an Irish Cop in \"The Untouchables\", and a stunning performance as a young girl in \"The Piano\" made this movie special. Mr. Robert Brown is a new face to movies, and he too will eventually be rewarded for his talents, as Jamal he was excellent.No violence, no sex, and no special effects equals little notice with rare exception. The one film Company who consistently denies the death of quality filmmaking is Merchant Ivory Films, and then there are the independents.The film is not perfect but it is vastly superior to the majority of films that were offered in 2000. For the price of the DVD you get a great cinema experience, can sit at home with no one repeating dialogue to his or her neighbor, or having the \"Cougher\" who inhabits every film.

The two begin an uneasy friendship, and Forrester helps Jamal with his writing, even as Jamal receives a scholarship to a private school and is befriended by the mature, understanding Clare (Paquin).  From there, however, the plot implodes with cliches and nonsense--a professor out to get the jock, a writing contest, a bitter teammate, allegations of cheating, the state championship game, the redemption scene, and so on.  (Why did Forrester never write another book?  The answer is less than satisfactory.)Starting with the _______-ing ________ title (both words of course starting with the same letter), the screenplay has the marks of excessive Hollywood handling all over it, and so it lacks the passion of Dead Poets Society, the raw energy of Good Will Hunting, and the excitement of The Karate Kid.  I'd recommend watching any of those three before this one.  And before that, I'd recommend reading (among others) The Great Gatsby, Cry the Beloved Country, All the Pretty Horses, and To Kill a Mockingbird.  (Or reading them again.)If you're a hard-core fan of Connery or \"feel good\" movies, this could be a decent weekend rental.  Otherwise, the above-mentioned films and books are much more satisfying.  (Some other decent, writing-related movies: The Hours, The Whole Wide World, and Shakespeare in Love.)  A disappointing 2-1/2 stars."],["Jamal Wallace (Robert Brown [in his screen debut]), a high school student living in the Bronx, does all of the right things. He goes to school, he plays basketball and he hides his intelligence. In an effort to be accepted by his friends and colleagues, he receives straight Cs and most of his teachers recognize that he is capable of more. After receiving very high scores on the Statewide standardized exams, his teachers urge him to accept a scholarship at a private school in Manhattan. He goes to check it out and meets Claire (Anna Paquin), his guide for the day. The school is very interested in having him join the basketball team, to help them make it to the championship. Jamal finds that he might be challenged here and decides to attend. Jamal has also just met an old recluse living in the top floor of an old brownstone near his basketball court. The recluse (Sean Connery), a local legend as a scary being, reads some of Jamal's writing and encourages him to write more. They meet daily in the old man's apartment and he stirs Jamal's creative juices, getting him to further enhance his already considerable writing skill. Jamal soon learns that the old man is William Forrester, a J.D. Salinger-esque novelist who wrote one widely acclaimed novel (think \"Catcher In The Rye\") and then disappeared from public view.I have always enjoyed the work of Sean Connery. His screen presence has always been magnetic and he has used that to great advantage in most of his films. He earned fame and riches from playing icons, creating a character that will probably forever be credited to him. He has been unable to shake that character even though the last time he played the character was over fifteen years ago. Connery has created some incredible performances through the years. He played an aging Robin Hood against an aging Maid Marian (Audrey Hepburn) in a very good film that many people have never heard of. He played a great thief in a film called \"The Anderson Tapes\". He played a great con man that would become \"The Man Who Would Be King\". He played an aging mentor in \"The Untouchables\" adding a lot of class and earning an Academy Award for his portrayal. He has played a lot of memorable roles that challenged his acting skills. He has also appeared in films like \"Meteor\", \"Just Cause\" and \"First Knight\". Truly terrible films that only served to mar his work. However, he has never played a character like William Forrester. We have all seen characters like this in a number of films. A recluse, a famous person, a bombastic person. Yet Connery brings a quality to the role that is very unique. Often, actors use this type of role to chew the scenery and run around screaming and yelling. This only serves to undermine the character. If the character is an old man or woman where are they getting all of this energy. Connery plays the character old. He does raise his voice, but to make a point. He does impart his wisdom, but his wisdom makes sense. I actually believed that he was a writer, listening to the advice he gives his young protege. It is an incredibly rich performance that should know become the standard for which Sean Connery is judged. James who?Rob Brown brings a lot to the role and manages to hold his own against Connery. This is no small feat. A lot of this can be credited to his naturalistic performance. Brown has obviously lived through events that are very similar to those depicted on the screen and he channels his own emotions to that of the character. One of the many good things about the film is that Jamal and Forrester seem to teach and learn from each other, enriching each other's lives.Gus Van Sant returns to territory that is very similar to \"Good Will Hunting\", but he creates a different mood and feel, helping to set \"Finding Forrester\" apart from the other film. The film opens with a shot of a marker with Van Sant's name on it followed by some documentary style footage of kids in the neighborhood. This immediately heightens our awareness of the neighborhood and the people who live there. It is actually a great touch, bringing the audience into this world very quickly and effectively. The film is then told in a fairly conventional style as Van Sant concentrates on the characters and the story. The film moves at a leisurely pace; it takes about four meetings between Jamal and Forrester before they actually start working together. This allows us to get to know these characters in what seems a natural way.Van Sant and the writer, Mike Rich, another first timer, focus on a lot of details which make the film seem very rich. Jamal's mom, Ms. Joyce (April Grace), is a very good mother who encourages her son and provides a good home. His brother, Terrel (Busta Rhymes), encourages Jamal to take chances, to avoid making the same mistakes he made. He had dreams of being a rapper but is now the supervisor of parking services at Yankee Stadium. He hasn't achieved his dreams, but he doesn't let this make him bitter. Jamal's friends are also a very close bunch. Forrester is a recluse, yet he insults the few people who are required to visit him on a regular basis. These details may seem insignificant, but they help create a richly textured film.F. Murray Abraham plays the English professor at Jamal's new school and he is very effective. His snobbishness affects his every exchange with people. They are either less intelligent or undeserving of such an education. Anna Paquin plays a young girl who becomes closer to Jamal. Her performance is very good because she seems more attracted to Jamal for the dangerous aspect of an interracial relationship. At times, she seems to wonder if she is actually attracted to Jamal or the color of his skin.I found one thing odd. In a film about writing, we hear almost none of either writer's work. We hear a couple of lines here and there, but it is difficult to take that in in such a brief period of time. I would have liked to hear more of the writing in the final competition, to get more of a sense of the authors work. Instead, Van Sant shows us reaction shots of the various students, set to music, which I didn't feel was very effective.\"Finding Forrester\" is one of the best films of the year. Connery is great, the direction and writing are rich and subtle and the film is very enjoyable."],["This movie was well written.  The acting was super.

Sneaking out past curfew, smoking pot behind the garage? What if this secret wasn't yours to tell? Do you think that would make it easier or harder to keep?Jamal Wallace (played by Rob Brown) is a basketball player in the Bronx. When we enter the story, he's recently taken academic assessment tests and, in contrast to his work in class, has scored high enough to gain the attention of the school board. On top of this, it is mentioned that Jamal (Brown) is an exceptional basketball player. One night, after a successful game, he is sharing a meal with friends at a restaurant. They discuss, among other things, a neighborhood resident who is something of an urban legend, referred to simply as \"the window\" because he never leaves his apartment. A common tradition among the group is for one member to dare another. One of the men dares Jamal to break into \"the window's\" apartment and return with something from inside. Jamal enters the apartment and sees a letter opener shaped like a knife but, much to his surprise, \"the window\" catches him, yelling loudly and inspiring Jamal to flee. Until his mother makes him aware of the fact, he never realized that he left his backpack in the apartment. That's set aside, briefly, when he meets with an admissions officer from an expensive private school, as a result of his test scores. When his mother says they couldn't possibly afford the tuition, the school official says that if Jamal were to continue playing basketball with the same skill for his new school, that tuition will not be an issue. In the time since, Jamal's backpack was unceremoniously dropped from \"the window's\" apartment and the notebooks inside, all containing creative writing of Jamal's, now with editorial comments written with a red pen. Jamal approaches the apartment, this time using the front door, and asks \"the window\" if he would read more of his writing.I truly love this movie. Brown as Jamal Wallace is a character you cannot help but like, despite his momentary foray into delinquency. \"The Window\" who is later identified as a renowned author who became a recluse decades before we're introduced to him. \"The Window\", played by Sean Connery, is a very sympathetic character and, as he takes on the role of mentor to Brown's character, the audience is given the opportunity to see it change both of their lives for the better.

Barbra Streisand plays 1910s Broadway sensation Fanny Brice. These two movies practically chronicle her life as one of the Ziegfeld follies all the way to being a Broadway superstar. If you're a fan of these movies, then I suggest you should get this 2-movie pack, which will most likely be cheaper than getting the movies separately.\"Funny Girl\" (1968) is two and a half hours of comedy, music, and drama. It chronicles Fanny Brice as one of the Ziegfeld follies, meeting and later on marrying Nick Arnstein (Omar Sharif), where they have a child named Frances. The first hour of the movie is fun to watch, where Barbra is a \"funny girl\", and about an hour and a half later, the film gets more more serious all the way to it's dramatic ending, where Barbra sings \"My Man\". A few other musical highlighs include \"I'm the Greatest Star\", \"People\" (her hit song), and \"Don't Rain on My Parade\". All together, \"Funny Girl\" is worth repeated viewings. It's a great Oscar-winning musical production.\"Funny Lady\" (1975) is two hours of more comedy, music, and drama, and while it's not as good as the original, I still really like it. It picks up right where \"Funny Girl\" left off. It starts off dramatic, with Barbra still shaky over the divorce, and later on, she meets songwriter Billy Rose (James Caan), and he marries her even though they don't quite love each other. It turns from dramatic to funny to dramatic again. The thing about this film is that, unlike the first film, this one actually made me laugh. It was pretty funny, and it had good songs too, including \"How Lucky Can You Get?\", \"Let's Hear it For Me\", and \"I Found a Million Dollar Baby\". \"Funny Lady\" isn't absolutely amazing, but it's still a very good movie.Barbra Streisand has a career that's been going on for a half a century, and these movies showcase her extreme musical talent, and both are very good movies that deserve to be seen."],["The costumes are amazing, love them.Barabra at her best.Styling perfect,great ideas and still amazing today.Some of the outfits i want made for me.A classic."],["I mean, who are you that you do not know this movie?

I would recommend buying it to any musical fans, especially with the huge musical hits in the movie.Funny Lady on the other hand is a disappointing follow up. The plot for the most part is okay, but the songs aren't spectacular (when there are any), they don't seem natural, and there are just enough to keep it classified as a musical, although Streisand has a few good solos. Over all I would classify the movie as more of a drama than a musical. My main problem is the language and other content though. Everything but the f-bomb is dropped in this movie which contains so many curse words I lost track. Don't get me wrong, I expected this from anything made by Columbia, especially combined with Tri Star in the mid 70's, but I was hoping for the sake of following up a great musical like \"Funny Girl\" that they would clean the sequel up a bit from the rest of their movies. I was very disappointed. Would not recommend this movie for the family, unless you have a decent cuss box that is.Overall I would recommend, as others have, buying \"Funny Girl\" and renting \"Funny Lady\" if you are curious, like I was, what will happen where \"Funny Girl\" leaves off.

Love Omar in anything."],["Far more than sharing the extended life story of Ziegfeld Follies star Fanny Brice, these two movies really show how Barbra Streisand transformed from a screen novice to a reigning goddess over the course of seven years. When she hit the big screen in 1968's \"Funny Girl\", she became an instant movie legend as master filmmaker William Wyler tailored a launching pad so accommodating to her personality and drive that it becomes apparent only later that the film itself is not terribly exceptional. The first half of the film, by far the best part, is about Brice's fast climb to stardom and her blind infatuation of gambler Nick Arnstein, played with a bit too much continental charm by an overshadowed Omar Sharif. The comparatively dramatic second half is really about the inevitable fate of their relationship. The energy that drives the first half seems to sputter in the second half, and Streisand is left to carry the whole thing to the finish line.The fact that the story has anything to do with Brice seems purely circumstantial in deference to Streisand's phenomenal talent especially as a first-rank comedienne and the pre-eminent song stylist of her generation. For the latter aspect alone, \"Funny Girl\" is essential viewing, especially for three solo numbers penned by the legendary team of Jule Styne and Bob Merrill (who co-wrote \"Gypsy\"). First, as a young wannabe trying to convince Mr. Keeney at the local burlesque house to hire her, Streisand sings \"I'm the Greatest Star\" with an appropriately persistent brassiness that suddenly turns into a dramatic clarion call picking up the percussive momentum of \"Don't Rain on My Parade\" until the song title truly becomes fact and not a boast.The second song is her anthem, \"People\", sung to an unsurprisingly awestruck Sharif on the darkened Hollywood-phony backlit set of Henry Street, first as an expression of her unrequited love for Arnstein and then more effectively as a solo plea bordering on desperation as she leans against a lamppost. The third number is made breathtaking by the ingenious way that Wyler films her performance of \"Don't Rain on My Parade\" as a montage of fast cuts that leads an Arnstein-chasing Brice to the amazing tugboat finish. The fact that they all occur in the first half makes the second half all the more desultory saved at the end by Streisand's memorably triumphant take on Brice's \"My Man\". These are all indisputably classic movie musical moments.The remaining numbers are good and mostly a vehicle to show off Streisand's considerable comedy skills - maneuvering roller skates on \"I'd Rather Be Blue (Over You)\", flouncing her dress in front of a nonplussed Ziegfeld on \"Second Hand Rose\", waddling around as a \"pregnant\" bride in the Ziegfeld extravaganza \"His Love Makes Me Beautiful\", accommodating Arnstein's aggressive parlor advances in \"You Are Woman\", and chronicling her happily married state in \"Sadie, Sadie\". That's not to say she is not a fine dramatic actress, just a sometimes rather theatrical one at least in her first film here, as she expresses her heartbreak in a variety of overdone hairstyles and clothes until her seeming vindication at the end. No other actress can express as dexterously the concurrent insecurity, egotism and humor that Streisand in her prime could.The talent is still very much in evidence, but the spirit has hardened somewhat in \"Funny Lady\", the 1975 sequel which picks up Brice's story during the Depression when the established star struggles financially to preserve her career. Unlike its predecessor, this movie does not provide a character arc which allows us to discover anything new about her character. Instead, director Herbert Ross and screenwriter Jay Presson Allen focus on the turbulent, sometimes comic relationship between the established Brice and her eventual husband, rising impresario Billy Rose. The staccato dialogue between the two, a far cry from the moony worship Brice held for first husband Arnstein in the first movie, is what makes \"Funny Lady\" good light entertainment even though the old-fashioned narrative often feels disjointed and truncated.Fortunately, in full diva mode as the success-insulated heroine, Streisand is at the top of her game here, and James Caan brings youthful energy to his portrayal of the brash, egotistical Rose. The rest of the actors barely register, including Roddy McDowall as Brice's unctuous assistant and confidante, Ben Vereen who doesn't have a single line of dialogue as entertainer Bert Robbins, and an embalmed-looking Sharif reprising his role as Arnstein this time as a preening, materialistic fortune hunter. What a shame that the swooning love story of the first film reaches such a cynical denouement in this story.There are songs written for the film by the estimable team of John Kander and Fred Ebb, and they meld nicely with the old, Rose-penned standards presented here. However, some of the production numbers are badly staged, for example, the faux-gospel take on \"(It's Gonna Be a) Great Day\" with a sequin-infested Streisand surrounded by an ensemble of uncoordinated dancers, or the clarion call of \"Let's Hear It for Me\" complete with a roadster and a biplane to replicate the driving rhythm of its obvious inspiration, \"Don't Rain on My Parade\". In fact, there are many ill-used references to \"Funny Girl\" from the opening montage to the overorchestrated refrains of \"People\" when Arnstein kisses Brice.Moreover, the movie has a constant veneer of excess, especially the overdone Bob Mackie gowns, as if nothing seems rooted in reality. Through all this, Streisand does manage to create some breathtaking musical magic - her sonorous version of \"More Than You Know\" in the recording studio; her torchy, show-stopping lament, \"How Lucky Can You Get\" (although her revealing gown is rather distracting); and best of all, her pristine rendition of the old chestnut, \"If I Love Again\", set against a glass grand piano. These are the pleasures that make the movie worthwhile in spite of its various shortcomings."],["This is classic Babs at her best!  I ADORE Streisand movies and love this one.

Many DVD \"featurettes\" bore me as mostly everyone interviewed banally talks endlessly about how talented and wonderful everyone else is; how lucky they are to be involved in such a \"profound\" project; etc. This short was obviously produced, possibly as a promotional piece, during or shortly after the actual filming in 1968.

Well they did and that is the kind of star power that makes both FUNNY GIRL and FUNNY LADY nothing short of fantastic.)Although FUNNY LADY is not the film that FUNNY GIRL is, give it a chance.  Produced in the \"new style\" way of CABARET, the camera got more into the musical numbers so that a bit of the staginess and old fashion charm is lost.  That does not mean that, again, Barbra Streisand does not pull off another major coup.Good singing/ acting and fantastic family fun.

She's also a superb comedienne as witnessed int the \"Bride\" number which literally brings The Zeigfeild Follies to a screeching halt(much to the chagrin of The Great Zeigfield himself.) The \"Don't Rain On My Parade\" number was greeted with applause when I saw it in a theater,as did many of the other numbers.

Probably those people would feel like that if they play  with 5.1 surround systems, the presence is so fantastic !Tina Arena  appeared in the title NO MORE TEARS who replaced Barbra Streisand is a  brilliant take.

This concert is a must buy for fans !!!"],["While I have not watched this video in quite some time, still, it was so strong, many parts are still fresh in my mind.Donna Summer sang her heart and soul out. The old songs sounded fresh and new.One of the highlights was a  \"2\" version of \"Dim All The Lights\" along with a story of how she wrote it originally for Rod Stewart, and in fact doing the first verse in an acoustic version.\"She Works Hard\" was an extended version, giving the band members a chance to shine.And of course, whenever Donna Summer sings gospel, it takes on a special meaning for her, she becomes serene.Last Dance-the FULL version, not a scaled down version that radio stations annoyingly compromise.The quintessential Donna Summer performance, not to be missed."],["i was not disapointed when I watched is performace of lady Donna.

Donna sang old songs and new songs and song them all flawlessly!"],["I hate to say it, but the Disco 70s were my \"glory years\", and Donna Summer personifies that time. Now years later, it is truly wonderful to see a matured and looking fabulous Donna sing these songs again with so much flair: she is clearly having a lot of fun.Everything about this DVD is so enjoyable--Donna has one of the best voices in the business; it's with good reason she has surivived where others haven't. She looks great, and I love her interaction with the audience, her gestures, and eye communication.  She is really quite humorous.And who knew she could be such a fine singer in other genres? I Don't Wanna Work shows what a great folk singer she is. The songs she wrote for her life-story musical are very good.The musicians in this production deserve special mention here. They are really excellent, and really make this show come alive. Also great is the light show, the camera work, and don't forget the great audience who are totally appreciative of the Great Diva. The background singers include her husband and sister, and what a hoot they are.Also I absolutely love the video of Con Te Partiro.  It is a clever and wonderfully directed video, Donna looks unbelievable, as is her singing. And for those who love the sight of beautiful men (like me) the accompanying male ballet movements are a real treat!The only negative thing I can say is the inclusion of that awful \"No More Tears\" song. It is even more irritating with  Tina Arena  than it was with Barbara.Anyone who lived and loved the 70s MUST have this video. And if you are of the younger generation and not familiar with Donna Summer, just get and discover something you are sure to enjoy."],["Ex-disco queen Donna Summer sings her old hits, disco and otherwise, in concert.done a decade ago (man, how time flies!)This was very good. Summer still has a solid, powerful voice, a nice manner about her, and most of the songs here are just fine. the disco numbers, by now, are nostalgic. Most of them are ones I have enjoyed listening to for years. Donna can still sing them pretty well, perhaps not as well as when she was younger but close enough.Summer also gives a \"testimony\" or two. She isn't afraid to show hr Christianity, even in front of a VHS-1 crowd.In one song, she does a duet with Australian singer Tina Arena, who was very impressive.The time here goes by quickly so that tells you it's a pretty good concert. I had the VHS of this but now own the DVD which gives a better picture and much better sound."],["It's so great to see Donna Summer singing her hits and more.  It's beautiful documentation like this concert that will help her legend, mastery and beauty live on.  I watched it on a large projection with state of the art sound, but even watching it on my laptop gave me a thrill.  Bravo! So glad that this DVD is part of my collection and a wonderful way to honor one my super divas."],["naturally, i have been aware of donna summer and her music for many years, even though i had never actually watched her perform her hits on stage. i caught this show on its original airing on VH1, and i was completely spell-bound. Her presence on stage, her command of the audience, and, above all, the power and richness of her amazing voice nailed me. Never resorting to impossible-to-sing-along-with vocal gymanastics, unlike most modern-day divas, Ms. Summer just sings the songs the way they should be sung, with power and precision, and a lot of soul. Her performances of 'Someone to Watch Over Me' and 'If There is Music There' are awe-inspireing. 'Bad Girls' and Hot Stuff' never sounded better, and 'Last Dance' was extraordinary. This concert should be seen by all wannabees in the dance music industry as proof that there should be first and foremost a voice to carry the song. This wonderful lady is proof of that, she's a living legend, and has never sounded better in her life!"],["Donna Summer was a radiant 48 years old at the time of this great live 1997 or 1998 VH1 concert.  While Summer had long shed her voracious \"Bad Girl\" image of the seventies, quite a bit of her ponyish beauty remained intact here.  This concert does full justice to her still-beautiful chameleon-like voice as she moves easily from full-throated disco (\"MacArthur Park\") to pop standards (an exquisite version of Gershwin's \"Someone To Watch Over Me\")and broadway (\"If There is Music There,\"), to pop-rock (\"She Works Hard for the Money,\"), country (\"I Don't Wanna Work\"), sultry gospel-blues (\"Riding Through the Storm\") and back again.  Summer's rapport, ease and generosity with the audience is equally gratifying.  Not unlike many other great artists of yesteryear, feature-length concert footage of Summer is hard to come by, so this DVD is definitely welcome!  The sound quality is absolutely amazing--especially given that it came out in 1998, around the time that DVDs first took off!  At its best, this concert effectively showcases all the qualities--part glamour girl, comedienne, renegade, devoted wife and mother--that set Donna Summer apart from the rest of the pack."],["Oh, how sad that this gal is gone.

It's all true what they say. It's an outstanding performance, clear and brilliant. Good musicians and good atmosphere. It's incredible to see how Donna sings through a bunch of her early disco hits as if they have been recorded yesterday! They sound fresh en untouched by time. Wonderful ballads (sadly enough not issued on the album) have to be heard and seen! It makes me wonder how a DVD recording or the first Live and More (1978)would have been! And that voice... oh my... that voice. I show this DVD to non Donna fans and they are shocked and grabbed as well by the superb singer Donna. The videoclip of &quot;I Will Go With You&quot; is a good bonus. Especially the remix version. Why wasn't that to be seen on MTV? I do not know... perhaps because the charts are dominated by teens.

This DVD brings back Donna Summer up and close and very personal. Her voice is amazing and the DVD quality is great. Donna Summers voice aged well, not many female, or male artists can boast this reality. She was a trained vocalist and this helped her retain her voice over the years without abuse.

I highly recommend it to the Donna Summer fans."],["\"Live and more encore\" is titled as a sequel to Donna Summer's 1978 #1 album \"Live and more\". Recorded in early 1999 by VH-1, it featured a lovely looking Donna (with a new haircut) largely unchanged by time vocally, singing some of her numerous hits, a few new songs, and some covers. Also very nice is her warm interplay with the audience, especially for songs like \"On the radio\" and the rapturous welcome given the new song \"My life\" (a classic ballad/dance anthem). It must be noted that some versions of the songs here are edited differently from those on the accompanying \"Live and more encore\" CD. Examples are \"MacArthur Park\", \"Hot stuff\", and \"My life\" (which are cut shorter than the CD versions), and \"She works hard for the money\" which is much longer and features Donna introducing the band.Featured on the DVD (and not on the CD) are the slightly jazzy standard \"Someone to watch over me\", the moving autobiographical self penned ballad \"If there is music there\" (which has Donna wiping away a tear at the end), the gospel \"Riding through the storm\", the upbeat folk/rock self penned \"Don't wanna work\", and the lovely pop/soul self penned ballad \"Nobody\". I ripped these songs for play on my iPod.The DVD features an autobiography, discography, chart statistics, and you can turn on song lyrics to display while each song is being performed. Also included are two music videos for the new studio recording \"I will go with you (Con te partiro)\" which earned Donna a Grammy nomination in 2000. The different videos feature alternate versions of the #1 dance hit, and show a stunning Donna with a lovely backdrop of dancers. We also get to see some behind the scene shots; the crowds arriving for the show, Donna arriving, getting dolled up for the show, etc.An enjoyable concert and a feature filled DVD, well worth it. Donna (at 59) is still touring and putting up an energetic show. Her new CD titled \"Crayons\" is tentatively scheduled for a May 20 release, and a cut from it, \"I'm a fire\" (which is vintage Summer) is already scorching up clubs in the US."],["This is a great music DVD and Donna has not lost her great voice thru the years."],["we need a dvd also of the 1978 concert. can anyone fine out if it was recorded. live & more at the amphitheatre. this was donna at her peak ala!

It features one of Pop's music most recognized and still powerful voice of Donna Summer.  For those who wonder where is Donna, here she is still stunning and singing songs with the ease of a seasoned professional, after all she has been singing and recording for over 25 years!While the clothes are not as revealing as her early days, nor will you find Donna moaning and groaning to her &quot;Love To Love You Baby&quot; days of past or doing sensual foreplay with the microphone....She  does deliver a true Pop Diva performance, doing most of her disco classics and adding touches of Country, Gospel, and Broadway Theatre to other songs, continueing to show that she remains as versatile as ever.Before Madonna, Whitney, Mariah and Toni there was Summer....."],["VH1 Presents: Live & More Encore!Donna Summer delivers a great concert.  Her voice is fantastic, orchestrations and background singers are terrific.  Donna glows with the warmth and charm which made her one of the biggest disco sensations.  Her talent has not diminished over the years.  This DVD is worth it just for her opening rendition of \"McArthur Park\" and finale of \"Last Dance,\"  She looks great in tasteful and flattering costumes.  It's also very nice to see a live audience standing on a dance floor thoroughly enjoying her music.  A must buy if you like Donna Summer"],["For those that remember MacAurthurs Park and some of the other hit of Donna Summer it is a great DVD. I could have lived without the preachy parts and would have liked to see more of her popular songs."],["You will watch this countless times!  Although not widescreen, seeing her perform captivates you regardless.  I can overlook the menu and it's navigation because of what's out there of more recent Donna is slim.

If you like Donna you can't go wrong with this DVD!"],["From the opening number,the magical MacArthur Park, to the Last Dance finale, this is one scorching summer performance. Never has the Diva Donna looked and sounded so great, each song simply comes to life through Donna's  amazing vocal talent.

We have watched it over and over. Donna Summer has never received the praise she deserves! She is multi-talented . I would not hesitate to recommend this dvd to everyone."],["I was glued to my TV in the 90's when this special was produced and aired on VH1.  The first lady of disco transcends that label to become one of the GREATEST voices of this, or any time.  If you have loved her since the mid 70's or don't even know her name, this concert will appeal to you because her voice and stage presence are UNMATCHED.  She passed away on May 17, 2012 and this world will never see another like her.  Her battle with cancer proved she was a true professional right to the last.  DO NOT MISS THIS!!!!!!!!!!!  This concert will stand as a tribute to her memory.  She sings with an angelic choir now."],["This show seems to be just another typical Las Vegas type show offering work and exposure for fading pop star \"has-beens\".This live show is so much less than the true Donna Summer fan would want to have.  This concert performance does not reflect the \"Queen of Disco\", that you would probably hope to see and hear.  The Donna Summer here compared to the Donna Summer of \"one's expectation\" is like comparing a small pocket AM radio to a huge 70-piece orchestra in an acoustically sound concert hall.  I know that's an extreme exaggerated comparison, but, I'm sure you know what I mean.I know many of you may not agree with me, but it is obvious to me that some people don't really know the core of Donna Summer's success.  This show had a great deal of absence of something very important about Donna Summer.  Her founder, creator, and producer, Giorgio Moroder.In the 1980's, I took to liking Donna Summer's 70's hits a bit more, only because I discovered something more about Donna Summer's music.  Donna Summer herself, is nothing really extraordinary.  She's a vocalist really no better than Whitney Houston or even Mariah Carey.  She can only wish she was as talented as Shirley Bassey, Madonna, Celine Dion.  However, Cyndi Lauper, Nancy Sinatra, and Brenda Lee are still my personal favorites.What made Donna Summer great was the music behind her, the work of Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte.  This really came to light when I finally heard the album version of \"Love To Love You Baby\", and then I heard a nearly 16 minute, 12\" version of \"I Feel Love\".  Giorgio Moroder's music is what really matters here.  Donna was only a voice over the music.  Any female could have been chosen to sing over Giorgio Moroder's music, and the impact would have been the same.This live show of Donna Summer was okay.  I mean, Donna is still beautiful although I loved her wilder shows she did in her youth, and then she discovered God, and changed her ways as if she feels that she should apologize for her past performances.  When Donna talks on stage today, she seems to have all the charm of any know-it-all Detroit Postal mail carrier.  She sounds like she still has that \"living in the streets\" persona.  She doesn't sound as classy as she looked. In fact, she almost sounds like Oprah.Her producer back in the seventies has alot to do with what made her music so great.  Even those of us who despised disco back then, still discovered some art in the sound product behind Donna Summer. There is an undenyable sound that reflects the work of Giorgio Moroder.  You can hear it with Blondie's \"Call Me\", Kenny Loggins' \"Danger Zone\", Llimal's \"Never Ending Story\", Irene Cara's \"Flashdance\", and even Bonnie Tyler's \"Here She Comes\".  Giorgio Moroder produced those songs and made them better than what they could have been.Check out some of those other works of Giorgio Moroder.  He was creating some intense trance dance music through the 1970's and the 1980's.  \"Love To Love You Baby\" on Donna's first album, is almost 17 minutes long.  It should have stopped at 13:03 because it really did end quite nicely right there.  The remaining nearly 4 minutes really is only a repeat of the beginning of the song that eventually fades out.  It's actually annoying that the song does that, but I believe that was done only to make Side Two of her album equal in length to her Side One.  It was just extended as filler.  But anyway, listen to the main 13 minutes of that song.  Giorgio Moroder was quite the innovator of a new sound that is still considered \"cutting edge\", even today.In 1982, I found a 12\" single of Donna Summer's \"I Feel Love\".  This is a Giorgio Moroder \"tour de force\" on electronics and trance music.  Patrick Cowley had put some of his sound skills into this piece of work as well.  I'd like to know what else Patrick Cowley has done over the years.  Anyway, I don't know of any CD that has this 16-minute version but it is one of the greatest examples of Giorgio Moroder's great sound invention.  I've had this 12\" single for nearly 25 years now.  It's in my attic, somewhere.  I've recorded it onto Reel-to-Reel tape back in the 1980's when I had a record player.  I hope it'll be on CD someday.Plus, I believe Giorgio Moroder did all the remixing of Donna's Summer's 1979 album \"On The Radio - Greatest Hits - Volumes I & II.\"  The way he made everything gel together was great.  Giorgio Moroder continued to prove his predominate role in Donna Summer's earlier career.And also, Giorgio Moroder does have a dark side, away from disco and trance.  He's done some movie soundtracks.  His best dark albums are \"Midnight Express\", and \"Cat People\".  He's also done the music for \"Flashdance\", \"American Gigolo\", \"Scarface\", \"Electric Dreams\", \"The Never Ending Story\", \"Top Gun\", and probably others.  Giorgio Moroder also launched the career of Irene Cara, but she didn't go the distance that Donna Summer did.Donna Summer continued to release hit singles throughout the 1980's without Giorgio Moroder.  Would she really have gone as far if her name wasn't already known?  I mean, in the 1970's they called her the \"Queen of Disco\".  But, she was only a voice to the Disco.  Any female vocalist would have been called the \"Queen of Disco\", if Giorgio Moroder was the producer behind her.  Now Donna Summer seems to have become, more or less, a small venue coffee house performer. This show on this DVD proves it. I guess that was bound to happen considering 25 years ago were her prime success years.  This looks like a \"made for PBS\" broadcast show.Everybody grows old, Donna.  It's nothing to be ashamed of.  Thanks for the effort here anyway."],["This catches only a glimpse of the late Diva at what she did best - entertain her audience! Her concerts were filled with energy, humor, and uncontrollable dancing feet! As her husband said at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony earlier this year describing her concerts, Donna would take you on a ride that soared in the sky, then bring you down to some nice R&B, and gospel, while mixing it up with her sense of humor! If you've seen her perform before, you'll appreciate this dvd. If not, this captures only a clue of her mastery, gifts, and immortal talents! I miss you Donna!"],["I had been wanting a collection of Donna Summer's music that focused on her vocal skills.  Seems I've struck GOLD!!!!!

I enjoyedher performance and will purchase other concertson DVD in the future."],["Was very sad when she passed.  I wore out her albums back in the 70's & 80's.  When I saw this I had to have it and I was not disappointed.  I always wanted to see her in concert and the one time I almost saw her at Foxwoods, it was cancelled due to a family emergency.  Needless to say, I was disappointed.  I was thrilled to be able to own this and add it to my collection of favorites!"],["I actually owned the CD and VHS versions of this recording back when it was first released in 1999.  However, I got the DVD as a Christmas gift (to go with my new DVD &amp; Surround Sound), and was once again blown away by the power and quality of this performance.  I had forgotten the power and emotion that made me fall in love with this lady's talent 25 years ago.  It's still there, and better than it ever was.  The bonus track video and remix of Con Te Partiro are HOT! and I would challenge any other concert DVD to stand up to this masterpiece. Radio stations:  play the new stuff;  Sony--where is the new album?  There's a market out here.  Everyone else--buy and love this as much as we all do!"],["I have seen Miss Summer perform live in Vegas and this DVD went immediately to the top shelf in my personal music collection."],["I've had this DVD for several years and loved it.  The quality is excellent considering the release date.  I was not a Donna Summer \"fan\" at the time I got the DVD although I liked her music and remembered it from my high-school years.  After watching the DVD however I had an entirely new appreciation for her voice and for her music (which has sometimes been derided along with the rest of the disco era).  I can tell you this ... these songs and this voice have held up.  They are mesmerizing.  The most surprising thing to me is how I felt after Donna's untimely death a few days ago.  The day she died I dug out her \"On the Radio\" greatest hits CD to listen to in the car so I could remember her and the songs.  The surprise is that at that moment I realized (like others have written) how much her voice actually (and unbelievably) had improved by the time she performed this show.  It was the first time I had really compared the original songs to those on the DVD.  The song versions on this DVD shine above and beyond the originals.  The 1999 voice is smooth and refined while retaining the power that made Donna famous.  I found myself craving a CD release of this DVD music because the songs are so rich compared to the originals (which were already very good).  Finally, the Donna in this DVD is beautifully attractive in a way that shows a maturity and elegance that is not present in her earlier videos.  I liked the Donna Summer of the 70's.  I loved the Donna I found on this 1999 DVD.  Now that she is gone, watching the DVD brings some sadness, but also a joy and thankfulness that this once-in-a-lifetime voice and woman was captured in such stunning clarity for old and new fans alike to enjoy forever.  If you love Donna, you'll love this DVD.  If you don't know her music or are only a casual fan, buy this DVD and become converted like I did."],["Surround sound was great and Donna Summer rocks!

Also included is the hit &quot;No More Tears-Enough is Enough&quot; which she originally recorded as duet with Barbra Streisand. On the DVD, she is joined by Tina Arena for this duet and it is very impressive.  Tina Arena has a fantastic voice too. Tina's career hasn't been all that great possibly due to her bad choice of material over the years.Other highlights include a re-working of &quot;Dim All the Lights&quot; where Donna reveals the true side of dealing with record companies.I am thrilled that &quot;On the Radio&quot; and &quot;I Feel Love&quot; are included on the DVD.

That being said, it's pretty forgettable. While all three musicians showcased here do their best and do amaze, I find myself wanting to hear more Petrucci, a whole lot less Vai and maybe asking Satch how he decided to pick those three songs. Vai annoys me with his onstage antics and his truly pompous attitude. Plus, with the exception of Audience is Listening, his set sucked. Satch picked two bad songs out of three. I have nothing bad to say about Petrucci. I do have something bad to say about the last three songs where they're together. Petrucci just disappears soundwise at that point and makes it sound pretty lame. Anyway, overall I didn't enjoy this DVD, but it was still worth having to see such amazing musicians at play."],["Im not big on words so I'll make this short. This was one of the most incredible G3 concerts I have ever seen. Most of the songs are ones I like and John Petruccis guitar playing is phenomenal. I used to think Steve Vai was the best guitar player in the world. Mr. John Petrucci has me thinking twice about that. He only plays 2 songs on the DVD but they are very long and played flawlessly as far as I can see. I have watched this DVD at least 3x now and will probably do so many more times in the future. This one is a no brainer. Buy it."],["Amazing  words can't and don't even get similar  to this awsome music"],["This DVD is the BEST that I ever wanted it. I've always loved Steve Vai's guitar playing, and I was able to purchase it through Amazon.com!!!!"],["As a working guitarist, I hold Vai, Satriani, and Petrucci in the highest regard, as well as Malmsteen and Johnson from the previous G3 works. The other reviews here cover their mastery of their instruments well.  The only thing I would like to add is that my favorite bass player used to be Rocco Prestia from Tower of Power.  It is now Billy Sheehan."],["I'm just going to add to what others have already said.First, some people are complaining that Petrucci only played two songs in his solo set, whereas the others played three.  Well maybe if these guys could count past three, they'd realize that Petrucci's set was around 18 minutes long, Vai's was around 20, and Satch's was around 21.  Besides, if you want to see more of John, you could always buy a Dream Theater DVD.As far as Joe's choice of songs on the disc, it should be obvious... he included \"Up in Flames\" and \"Searching\" because they were two of the best songs on the album, \"Is There Love in Space\" (which was his most recent album at the time).  He also included \"War\", an older song that was not as big of a hit as some others.  I'm sure he played quite a few other songs, as there's no way he'd travel all the way to Japan to play for 20 minutes.  My guess is that those songs had to be cut out of the DVD in order to stuff the whole concert onto a single DVD.  Besides, they were probably already featured on the \"Live in SF\" DVD or the other two G3 DVDs.Conclusion: if you appreciate the electric guitar, buy this DVD.  Don't tell me you can't afford it.  It costs less than a single movie ticket."],["Had originally blasted this for the lack of sound coming from satriani's guitar during the three man jam. Another review pointed out that it is panned hard left. I'm guessing that we had some bad cables that just cut out his guitar - everything else could be heard.Pattrucci - excellent playing - clear and concise, my favorite for songs picked for the dvd. Unfortunatley he is as exiting to watch as a cardboard cutout.Vai - wild with a wild band.Satriani - my favorite for total watching experience - puts on a good show without going over the top."],["The three best guitar players together that was great very nice concert I love it great concert really good DVD"],["Desde hace algun tiempo estaba esperando  poder adquirir este DVD , primero salio en sistema Pal y ahora por fin lo sacaraon en el sistena NTSC, aunque el precio es un poco elevado, vale la pena tenerlo , para todo aquellos que como yo venimos siguendole los pasos a IT BITES desde la decada del 80 y nunca tuvimos la posibilidad de ver esta banda en vivo, este trabajo es un fiel testimonio de la excelente calidad musical de la banda.El DVD no trae extras y el sonido es estereo digital , pero la buena energia que maneja el grupo en escena hace que estos peque&ntilde;os detalles se pasen por alto.interpretan temas de sus tres trabajos en estudio mas que todo del EAT ME IN ST LOUIS Y DEL BIG LAD IN THE WINDMILL , para mi los dos mejores trabajos del grupo.Recomendado para aquellos que deseen ver una banda con mucha musica y tecnica."],["I have the original G3 Live DVD as well and I haven to say I liked it better.  Why? Because the camera work on the Toyko show sucks, most of the music isn't that interesting and it's just too much noise at once during the jam.However, I really did enjoy John Petrucci's two songs, he should have had more on here.  Glasgow Kiss and Damage Control were, to me, the most melodic and impressionalbe songs on the DVD.  Petrucci isn't much for show but he's got it down where it counts.Vai is the biggest 'explorer' of the three in terms of where he takes guitar music.  He is very innovative in his approach but I find that his music on here is repetitive and I lost interest a little too easily.  But he is a showman and that almost makes up for it.Satch is back at it but I still enjoyed his original G3 tracks more.  I dunno, these tracks just weren't that interesting to me for some reason.I guess it was just nothing too new for me, except for Petrucci.  I'd buy a DVD of just him in concert. (not Dream Theater)  I've been to a G3 show with Malmsteen and I've seen Malmsteen by himself too.  I think it's time for a new approach to the 3G formula though because it's gettin kind of stale in my opinion.If you don't have any of the G3 DVDs I'd go with the original.  I haven't seen the Denver show so I can't comment on that one.  They're all absolutely astonishing guitar players and musicians, no doubt about that.  But most of the music is just technical showcasing.

I had been disapointed with the show in Boston because of poor acoustics and sound mixing at the Orpheum. However, this DVD from thier Tokyo show is great and cost wayyyyy less than seeing them live. The sound quality is fantastic; the mix is perfect and the camera work is VERY good. In JP's set the camera at one point lines up perfectly to see JP and Dave Larou wailing over frets with synchronised speed and the effect is pretty exciting for a player who is watching. The Vai set is typical stuff and for me is OK but Satch's set is VERY good, maybe better than his set on the Satch, Vai, Johnson DVD. I had paid no attention to Petrucci till seeign the live show and this DVD has earned him my respect as a truly talented and professional player. His set alone is worth the price of this DVD. I also have the G3 DVD with Satch, Vai and Eric Johnson. That one is IMHO the best of the G3 concerts available on DVD. The Tokyo show is the second best. I saw the one with Malmstein and was very disapointed with Malmstein. One last note... of the 3 DVDs I mention here, the Satch, Vai, Johnson DVD has the best G3 jam at the end. The chemistry of those 3 in the jam's classic blues forum just worked better. Even Vai who is anything but a traditional blues player kicked out some of the coolest blues/rock licks I've ever heard; my favorite having a lot of Jimmy Page flavor to it."],["After watching this performance on YouTube, I just HAD to see it again! There is nothing like watching a live performance and this production comes close to that stage front and center experience! I know we're all listening to our music on 'ear buds' these days, but put this into your entertainment center and turn the knob! This collaboration just blows the doors off ...!!!Notably, Satriani has the widest appeal. His melodic and imaginative sounds mixed with good rhythms appeals to the masses. His finger work is recognizable and simply memorizing. He remains right on point in this performance and although his signature sound is identifiable, the collection is unique and does not disappoint ...I rate this as some of his best work to date. In the G3 group performances, as in others, he provides just the right amount of leadership to bring these 'Master's' together in an entirely enjoyable evening of sound and 'guitar magic'. This work is fantastic and just brings the emotions straight out of your chest until it is beating on fire right in front of your face ...and then your soul starts to scream and dancing.Vai's experimental nature does not always capture the general imagination as does Satriani's sound. Some 'folks' just don't get it. (I don't always). But here, more than any of his other performances that I've seen, Vai's style will click with the majority of listeners. And, as always, Vai has a certain 'performance/exhibitionist' style which is pure 'Rock-n-Roll'. Vai certainly puts on a good show. What most impressed me (and was culturally well received and understood in Tokyo, Japan) was his presentation of respect for his 'teacher', with a long, deep and humble bow of respect and appreciation to Joseph Satriani. &#34;Well Done, Vai!&#34;Petrucci was previously too extreme in his sounds for my liking. But, of all the surprises ...!!! I couldn't believe what I was hearing and seeing. I was absolutely beautiful, rich and deep! His invention, Glassglow Kiss, is superb and his finger work is nothing less than spectacular to watch. He appears a little the outsider, but with no less the respect. Wow! I almost ...almost change my favorite guitar players! It was that good! Again, this is a new sound for Petrucci, definitely appealing to a wider audience but with all the speed and more the delight than his previous work."],["I have been a tremendous fan of the G3 concerts for years. In fact, you can see me in the front row of the \"Live in Denver\" DVD.  There are few people that are bigger fans of Joe, Steve, John, Yngwie, and Eric than me.  Many people share my sentiments when I say that the three song set formula they have been using, leaves this post-concert experience a little empty.If you are fortunate enough to attend one of the concerts, it usually exceeds 3 hours and allows many more songs.  I've never understood why artists are unwilling to deliver what the fans (consumers) want (e.g. Metallica).  There is surely a market for a multi-disk compilation featuring the entire show. It would be worth the $100.00 expense.In regards to the DVD and CD, there isn't much to say.  The performances are great, but some of the camera work leaves something to be desired.  It is shot in a widescreen format, which I absolutely love, but it lacks the intimacy of the Denver show.  The cameras seem very far away for the most part and they have to put the zoom on maximum to get close shots.  There are also a couple of shots where they fail to adjust the viewing ratio and all three individuals are compressed, tall and skinny.The fabulous artists in Steve Vai's band are barely evident as well.  I would have been much happier to see some great shots of Dave Weiner and Tony McAlpine, but they were simply pushed to the side.The Audio is superb. With the exception of some amplifier issues during Joe's solo at the end (he explains it in the commentary section), the 5.1 audio is flawless and a very good mix.  The Joe Satriani technical difficulty is much more prominent on the CD version because their digital editor was able to smooth it out somewhat on the DVD. Joe doesn't believe in overdubs so he left it in to stay \"honest\" to the show.Unlike the \"Rockin' In the Free World\" release, the DVD and CD are identical.  Same location and set-list. Seems barely justifiable to purchase both.  Hardcore fans like me won't have difficulty justifying the expense.  Something to be mindful about, however, is the new copy protection software installed on the CD version.  This will restrict your ability to play it on your computer without installing proprietary software and nearly impossible to play and rip in iTunes if you have a Mac.  If you have the means, I would suggest recording the audio from the DVD to make yourself an audio only copy for in car use.Ultimately, this concert allows for fans to see and hear songs, to date, they have not heard live. Most classics are absent, with the exception of \"The Audience is Listening\", and most songs are prominent standouts from the artist's latest releases.  I can't really put my finger on it, but somehow I just feel a little short changed. Was it the (cold) venue? The camera work? I'm not really sure, but the experience lacks some luster."],["This dvd is very good, but I think they should have included at least one more Petrucci Song, he stole the show as Vai and Satriani do not offer anything new. Also Petrucci has Mike POrtnoy as drummer.The G3 jam is amazing: Hendrix, ZZtop and Deep Purple.An excellent purchase for such a low price."],["Petrucci - a big surprise.  He seems to be very precise, highly technical and very much melodic.Vai - my favorite in this DVD.  at his best.  \"Building the church\" is very powerfull, yet based on many oriental motives, using 1/4 tones etc.  his following track is a masterpeace. keeps you very much entratained, with unexpected tune development.  some blocks use  jazzy formats and jazzy positions.Satriani - I was a bit dissapointed by his 3 tracks which were not interesting enough.  I felt like he starts to repeat itself.3G jam - excellent selection. In this part Satriani came back to life , with closest as possible to the othentic original , basic sound and style from Hendrix and Blackmore.  Petrucci sounded a bit shy and too technical leaving his soul behind.  He needs another one or two 3G concerts to become part of the team.Sound and video - excellent quality. no complaints.Bottom line - just go buy it , don't waste your time reading these reviews..........."],["Not as Good as G3 in Denver, but still Pretty Kick Ass!!

The juice is what's on full display in this recording of a Tokyo show that just happened to fall out of somebody's closet one day. And here it is, readily available for our consumption, 16 years or so after the fact.Led by Frank Dunnery's Gabriel-esque voice and Holdsworthian fretboard wizardry and the writing talents of the band -- most notably John Beck on keyboards -- It Bites left behind a small but astonishingly durable body of work. Their best and longest song \"Around the World in a Day\" is conspicuously missing, but the second best, \"Old Man and the Angel,\" is not, and that alone is worth the price of admission. \"Yellow Christian\" is also a standout, and the inevitable \"Calling All The Heroes\" and \"Still Too Young To Remember\" are also featured.Check out the size of Dunnery's hands and his ease in singing over complicated guitar parts! Kind of makes one wonder why he dropped this gig so completely and took up life as a troubador and astrology expert (or some such nonsense).John Beck's keyboard work is hard to appreciate because it's kind of lost in the mix. Unfortunately his vocals are not; I wonder if the technology is not around to sweeten those up a bit because they really take away from what is otherwise a stellar set.I would have given this one five stars if it had included the entire set."],["You can't get much better than these three experts rocking Tokyo. The individual sets rock, but the jams are mind-blowing! A must have for any guitar fan!"],["I bought this because some other reviewers said it was the best of the G3 performances.  I'm much more familiar with Joe Satriani than Steve Vai and John Petrucci.  After watching this, nothing has changed for me.  Satriani has the most approachable sound.  I like some Vai stuff in moderation.  I appreciate Petrucci, but probably a little less than the other guys.I think that Steve Vai was the most entertaining on stage, but it is ultimately about the music, right?  Watching them all jam to the classics was really great.  Smoke on the Water from Deep Purple's live album is one of my all-time favorites and the version on this G3 stands up to the original very well."],["my favorite G3 effort. excellent camera work and sound. as usual, joe and steve were great. steve has the same line-up as the london dvd with a different drummer. that said, i thought john petrucci stole the show. he's got mike portnoy and dave larue with him (heavy duty firepower if i do say so)and works 'em. the songs are really well written and the performance is awesome. the reason i only gave it 4 stars is i really feel they could put more effort, organization wise, into the group thing at the end when they step all over each other. it's not appealing to those of us who know better. BUT, if you like instrumental rock guitar, you need to buy this now."],["Being a big fan of all three of these great guitarists this package is tremendous!! I loved Petrucci's solo project and the two songs on this dvd are from that. Vai and Satriani are as they always are, phenomenal!!! A guitar fan, buy this and all of the other G3 discs!!"],["great rendition of jimi hendrix's foxy lady"],["great guitar dvd"],["G3 returns in fine form with \"G3 Live in Tokyo\". The same formula as the last two g3 DVDs is repeated.  Joe Satriani  teams up with Steve Vai and find a third guitarist worthy of sharing the stage with them. Each member performs his own set and then all 3 jam on stage together. It worked on the  previous 2 DVDs and it works again. This time, with the addition of John Petrucci of Dream Theater/LTE, is the best time. Yes, there is only 90 minutes worth of music, but if you want the full G3 experience go see them. The 90 minutes is a great deal for under $15. Now to the show:John Petrucci plays a couple of songs from his \"Suspended Animation\" disc. I saw G3 with Petrucci back in 2001 and thought that he should release the music he was playing. Now he has. Both songs showcase Petrucci's ability to combine speed, tone and phrasing in an instrumental form. Both songs have a couple of tone and time changes, and Petrucci shows why he is considered one of the best guitarists in the rock genre. (Or any genre for that matter) Fans of Dream Theater or any of John's other projects won't be dissapointed. John is joined by, DT drummer, Mike Portnoy and Dave Larue of Steve Morse and Dreg's fame. The rhythm section is solid and all over John's music. A very good set.Steve Vai is next and continues to be the most energetic of the G3 members. Vai opens with \"The Audience is Listening\" from Passion & Warfare and it is a blistering version. Steve and bassist Billy Sheehan go wild during this song. They trade fours, exchange picking hands, and play some high speed unison lines. These two have been mesmerizing together since the David Lee Roth Band, and have taken their showmanship to new levels. \"Building the Church\" and \"K'm-Pee-Du-Wee\" are the other Vai tunes and Steve is his amazing self. Vai has been guilty of composing tunes that I can't identify with, but these are both great compositions and Steve's playing is true virtuosity at its best. Great set from a great showman.Joe Satriani's set is also very good. He plays great versions of \"Up In Flames\" and 'Searching' but is guilty of not stretching out as far as he can. Still, both of these songs are excellent and show Satch's unparalled ability to combine catchy melodies with guitar virtuosity. 'War' is a song that Satch stretches out on and improvises a unique ending. Excellent version.As always, the DVD ends with all 3 guitarists on stage. \"Foxey Lady\" is the first tune. Mike Portnoy plays drums on this tune.  How can you go wrong with these 3 guys jamming to Jimi? The last two songs have Jeff Campitelli on Drums and Billy Sheehan joins Matt Bisonette on bass. The two bassists alternate taking the vocal duties and do a decent job. Both songs feature each guitarist taking a solo spot and then all 3 trading 4s at the end. More G3 madness done right. As always, if you aren't a fan of guitar, you won't be a fan of this. If you are a fan of any of these three, then you should get this. I am a fan of all 3, and find it to be the best of the 3."],["The G3 legend continues with the legendary Joe Satriani, Steve Vai and John Petrucci offering individual performances, followed by all three taking the stage together in Tokyo. All three guitarists are top-notch in their performances and the sound quality on the DVD is excellent.The climax at the end of this is a riff-and-shred-trading session between the three during \"Foxey Lady\", \"La Grange\" and \"Smoke On The Water\".Quite frankly, I was disappointed that John Petrucci's session only included two songs and Satriani and Vai three. I think that one or two more for Petrucci, followed by another each for Satriani and Vai would have been beneficial towards making this a five-star rating. Indeed, the musical virtuosity on this comes in at five stars but the brevity of it knocks off a half-star to land at 4.5.Overall, I would definitely recommend this as an opportunity to see all three guitarists join together in a rare performance."],["This is the greatest rock guitar album ever! Satriani and Vai produce their usual high quality stuff, but the revelation is Petrucci, as he brings together all those years of experience with Dream Theater et al to produce two 10 minute tracks of sheer virtuosity: an amalgamation of skill, passion, power, and control. The conclusion of the three in concert together is a real joy as they take three old favourites (Hendrix, ZZ Top, and Deep Purple) and dance new rythms around old standards with delightful skill. Buy this album!"],["Don't listen to the other reviews about this DVD. Let me tell you why...First, people are complaining about the length of the DVD and how it only has 3 songs per set. Okay, 3 guitarists x 3 songs + another 3 for the Jam. Thats 15 songs, to be fair its 14 because Petrucci does 2. So 14 songs. And the DVD is $12 dollars!! Come on people, thats cheap for a Live DVD with 14 songs.Second, the camera angles and quality is great. Being a guitar player, I know that its important to focus a lot on the guitarists, which they do in this DVD.Third, people are saying that the sets are boring. The sets are GREAT because they play different songs than what is normal! Do you really want 3 dvds with the same songs on each one? I didn't think so.So in closing, this DVD is an excellent addition to anyones collection. The sound is great, the songs are a fresh addition to the live set, and the video is great too. Quit complaining people."],["John: Thank God for Petrucci.  His two songs are easily the best of the entire DVD.Joe: Joe is his usual self - good tunes, nice guitar but not as over-the-top in terms of jaw-dropping ability as the others.Steve: This is a let-down compared to G3 Denver.  Yeah, he plays some wild stuff, but compared to G3 Denver it's boring, pretentious, and simply hard to get into... this is partly why it only gets three stars.Jams: Pretty darn good.  In the first tune (Foxey Lady), watching Petrucci and Vai trade leads is simply jaw-dropping... I've always been a Vai fan, figuring there's nobody who can touch him... well, I stand corrected: Petrucci can play guitar alongside ANYBODY, even Vai.  Watching them play progressively more challenging licks had me laughing out loud - it's just plain NUTS how good these guys are!  The other two tunes are also quite good, although both Vai and Satch spend too much time twiddling their whammy bars squealing with their sustainers.Production: not that great... I mean, how hard is it, on a G3 DVD, to make sure the camera is on the player's fingers during the more difficult stretches?  Some of Petrucci's most impressive runs feature camera angles from behind, of his face, of the bass player, etc... disappointing.  Severely disappointing: this is the main reason it's only three stars.Extras: the \"sound check\" and commentaries are nice bonus features... not what we buy the DVD for, but certainly added value.Overall: if you like G3, you know you're buying it.  If you like Joe, it's a good representation of him; if you like Vai, prepare to be somewhat let down; if you like Petrucci, you'll truly enjoy watching him quite frankly out-play Satch and Vai.  Nonetheless, it doesn't rank with Vai Live at Astoria, or Dream Theater Live at Budakon.  Compared to those masterpieces it's only 3 of 5 stars."],["Excellent footage, sound quality, and camerawork from Japan.  Petrucci holds his own while opening the show with 2 songs.  Vai comes out for 3 tunes like a man possesed and Satriani melts your mind with his 3.  When they all get together for a 3 song jam they take turns with some breathtaking solos that really take songs like Smoke on the Water and La Grange to new levels.  This DVD is worth adding to your collection."],["I love all the G3, Joe Satriani and Steve Vai together is like having the two best guitar legends combined into one, I have never heard of John Petrucci before, so it was great to hear another great guitarist, and the three togther its an awesome mixIf you are a G3 fan add this to the collections :-)"],["I saw this show twice when it was in the US.  I saw it the first time in San Francisco (The Filmore) and liked it so much I bought a  ticket in Atlanta (The Tabernacle) and flew down there to see it!!!

Steve is awesome as usual.Enjoy!-Kirk"],["This whole DVD just \"ROCKS\" ... coz the best 3 have performed. I am not biased & truely no offense YJM & E.Johnson .... G3 is just Satriani, Vai & Petrucci.This DVD is a must for any G3 fan !!!!"],["The video it self is great. If you like classic rock or guitar stuff, you must own the G3 videos. The G3 live with Eric Johnson is my personal favorite. But this copy, the video at the end is messed up. The color runs all together the last few minutes. Kind of like something out of the 60's."],["Most of us are probably familiar enough with Satriani and Vai already, so I'll put some more spotlight on JP. John Petrucci (of Dream Theater) is an incredible addition to the G3 lineup this time around.When I first saw this DVD I was disappointed that John Petrucci only had two songs on the setlist. But his two songs \"Glasgow Kiss\" and \"Damage Control\" are as intricate and as powerful as they are long; so it really isn't a problem as you get to see Petrucci's uncanny ability to keep the same song fresh and exciting even eight minutes into it. Satriani and Vai tend to get a little repetative after a couple minutes, but Petrucci knows how to hold your interest. And unlike Yngwie (in the G3 Live in Denver video) JP is much more in tune with the crowd as well as with Satch & Vai; so there is chemistry all over the place.The Jam songs at the end of the video hold up to what you should expect from a G3 show. They trade licks, play three part harmonies, and occassionally just run everything together (which sounds a bit odd) as each G3 show has done before in the past. They all do a great job and really made what I paid for the DVD worth it.If you aren't sure which G3 video to purchase, I would recommend this one. I have seen them all, and think this one is marginally the best despite it only being 108 minutes."],["The tradition of G3 concerts is taken to a new level incorporating John Petrucci. It is sad that only two songs from him were included in this DVD. Satriani and Vai, as always, deliver their creativity, impecable technique, and control of the instrument and effects. The jam session is interesting ... it seems that Satriani and Vai were not in complete synchrony with Petrucci. But, any way, three virtuosos together always have something interesting to offer. It is becoming a tradition of this kind of DVD's to stuff them with irrelevant and poor additional features."],["If you don't like total guitar virtuosity, don't bother! John Petrucci, Steve Vai, Joe Satriani backed by bands that are as kick a** as they are! The DVD's sound is great, as is the camera work. You really have to see John Pertrucci's fingerwork to believe it! Steve Vai plays with his customary flair, and Satriani...well, I saw him at the Silver Legacy in Reno, and Leslie West of Mountain, who warmed up for him called him a &#34;(expletive) showoff&#34;! Petrucci's set included Dave LaRue of the Dixie Dregs on a cool Music Man bass. If you have the proper home theater system, at the end of the show, with you ears ringing, you'll think to yourself &#34;There's no way these guys are human&#34;!"],["This is another impressive concert from Satch and friends. My favorite part (Sorry Joe!) was the John Petrucci set. He plays only two songs from his Suspended Animation disc and Mike Portnoy and Dave LaRue are Rock Solid throughout. Searching is my favorite part of Joe's set and Vai is never disappointing. The Jam tunes were a little more cohesive than the Denver show. As much as I love Yngwie, I believe the jams were a bit more competitive then. Definitely less toes being stepped on with Petrucci. He was in awe of Satch and Vai while Yngwie didn't give two poops about them earlier in his career and has said as much in interviews back in the day."],["I would have given the show 5 stars, but the thing that pissed me off was when the 3 were doing improvisations to classic rocks songs, Vai would cut off Petrucci's ending to his solos when the 3 were going back and forth. For example, listen to when they cover ZZ Top's \"La Grange,\" particularly when they go back and forth. Listen to Petrucci's solos, and you'll notice Vai cutting off Petrucci a lot. For God's sake, Petrucci wasn't finished! Let him finish!!Anyway, that pissed me off a lot and I had to talk about it, lol."],["John Petrucci is a very smooth player, and when he's speed-picking, his right hand moves so quickly you can barely tell it's moving at all.  Steve Vai delivers the goods, as always, and his band is hot.  Jeremy Colson's enthusiastic drumming is particularly admirable.  Joe Satriani's performance of \"War\" is most significant; relevant to the times, Joe finishes with a bit of melody that is, shall we say, \"extremely Eastern.\"  I took this as a fairly bold statement.The jam at the end is, like the previous G3 jams, another guitar-mad frenzy.  The trading-off becomes a bit tedious.  Satch's guitar is panned hard-left, and he could be louder.  Joe's vocals are terrible on Hendrix's \"Foxy Lady,\" but Billy Sheehan does a good job with ZZTop's \"La Grange,\" and Matt Bissonette does OK with the Deep Purple classic, \"Smoke On The Water.\"  What's most interesting here, besides the welcome addition of Mike Portnoy on drums for the first song, is that Bissonette and Sheehan are on stage together.  Personally, I think the idea of two bass players is a great one.  It only adds to the \"guitarishness\" of it all.  Ok, I know I just made up that word.  Forgive me.  But I believe this is the first time we've seen two bass players in a G3 jam.All in all, this is a great concert and the price is right.  Though it may be a bit of a guitar overdose, it's just what some of us need to escape from the fashion show that is the pop scene these days."],["This is the 3rd DVD I have of G3, Vai and Satriani up to their usual over the top ego trip stuff. (cliched speedy guitar for teenagers)I am getting to see that too many ego's spoil the broth here.Also frustrated lead guitar players doing bass guitar solo's have never worked for me,(either play lead guitar or bass, or shut up), so stay at home Mr Sheen, and hand it over to a real bass player. (ie; Wooten)It's a great pity they never released the Japan G3 tour with Andy Timmons this would really be worth watching. (and he can out play all of them, and tastefully)I think that this is the last time I will buy a G3 DVD, the wrestling of on stage ego's formula is getting rather tired."],["The guys do it again....... All three G men are on top form,so are all the other musicians on stage.  Wonderfull DVD.Even better for the fact that the audience are not trying to make themselves heard during the songs !"],["This gives the chance to see Satriani, Vai, and Petrucci show off their playing and showmanship.  Well shot, and has high energy."],["I don't know guys. I just read the reviews posted and I'd have to say that I seriously disagree! This DVD is excellent! John Petrucci I do agree is probably the best of the 3 performances and it doesn't hurt having his DT buddy Mike Portnoy playing drums either! Dave LaRue plays some excellent driving bass! I saw G3 do this show a few years ago and I thought it was the best one so far! I saw G3 in it's previous incarnations as well as the last one with Y. Malmasteen. Enjoyed each one. I didn't get bored. I got energized! Lots and lots of raw energy in these shows. I also found the tour with Robert Fripp quite amazing. As far as the DVDs go I think the first release was not quite as strong as the Denver show and the Tokyo show. The Denver show really rocks too! But I think Steve Vai's performance on the Tokyo show was a bit more driving and strong than on the Denver DVD (and even alot of his stuff on the Live at the Astoria DVD). They come on strong on this one. Billy Sheehan is playing his butt off as well as Dave Weiner and Tony MacAlpine! And that drummer is simply amazing and playing so damned hard! To me it is simply amazing to watch. Satch's performance is top notch as well on his set. I also loved the first song he did on the Live at Denver DVD. Just amazing! I don't think any of this is stale (as a previous reviewer said). Far from it! I think it is a rare treat to have shows like this that bring all these artists together and I am thankful that Joe continues on with the G3 tradition."],["If you're a Petrucci fan, which I am you can't do without this DVD. AS well as lots of Satriani and Vai footage, the G3 videos essentially showcase the talents of 3 exceptionally amazing guitarists, and with me being a long time Dream Theater fan I couldn't miss this one. John goes through a couple of tracks from his solo project which on all accounts does not fail to impress one bit.Do the needful. Buy this DVD."],["Thats right...can you believe it?Marty Friedman apprently jammed with the 3some on stage that night,and its not on the DVD.I thought these 3 would be beyond things like royalty distribution etc and would put out the best dvd they can,for the love of the craft.You cant have Marty play with you and not put that on tape...or dvd.That apart...the dvd is awesome.Production values are top notch.Like somebody else said,I wish Steve Vai had chosen better songs.....I am not too crazy about Satch's \" up in flames\" either....Petrucci is flawless.A great buy by all means"],["Great DVD...Great Price"],["with all due respect to the monumental talent on this DVD, the John Petrucci trio stood out from the rest. Only two songs in the set, but what beautiful numbers, flawlessly performed, all three musicians tight and precise.The opening number, Glasgow Kiss, has a celtic feel and Petrucci shines with a focused intensity from the first lyrical riff  to the high-powered finish.  Drummer Mike Portnoy plays perfectly off Petrucci--at the finale, he leaps out of his chair as a release from the intensity of his concentration. A magical musical moment! The second number, Damage Control, starts out with a toneless power-chord riff that repeats a little too long before  unfolding into a beautiful instrumental epic. Lots of wonderful twists and turns with an exotic, middle-eastern groove woven in. I have to say this set from the Tokyo tour is my favorite out of all three of the G3 DVD releases.  As for Vai's and Satriani's sets, those guys are incredible guitarists and I love their playing. But some of Satch's compositions seem redundant and Vai's drummer doesn't appear to get a chance to explore rhythmically or dynamically on Vai's numbers. Even so, this DVD is a great one to own and listen to repeatedly. Don't forget to check out Petrucci's nod to Richie Blackmore\"s solo from the great Deep Purple Made in Japan album during the G3 jam. It's all good!"],["Petrucci and Johnson are my favorite to round out the triads in Steve and Joe's shredfests. Petrucci is a class act and an ensemble player who is not a limelight hog or a show-off.

Their live concert in Chicago had me feeling like I was actually at the concert, but I was more impressed with their Unplugged sessions. They did a great job doing acoustic versions of hard songs 'The Warmth' and 'Certain Shade of Green', which I really thought was impossible to do.Everyone is used to seeing lead singer Brandon Boyd go 'nuts' in his performances...but it is no secret that he has an amazing voice.

This is what to watch if you want to see what Incubus can do in concert. The thing that makes me like them so much is the way they mix things up. They're not afraid to do an extended version of a song, or change up the lyrics somewhat. Another reason this is such a good DVD is because of the little scenes in between a few songs. It really shows you that Incubus really do love what they do, and have a good time doing it. I really like how they mixed show clips too, it's interesting to see how they can change from show to show. Also, their song choices couldn't have been better. They play all of my favorite songs from S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and Make Yourself. They also play them perfectly, Brandon shows that he doesn't need vocal help like some lead singers do nowadays. Mike gets to show how good he is at playing guitar on here too, he really is amazing. The band as a whole prove that they are one of the better bands to see live. The sound quality by the way is really good, especially if you have surround sound.Just a few of the best songs are Favorite Things, Pardon Me, The Warmth, and Redefine. Like I said though, every song is great, there is no song on here I would change. I reccommend this DVD to any Incubus fan in search of a good DVD of them.

If you have a choice of DVD/VHS get the DVD it contains about.. an hour more of footage I think, plus you gotta just have it for the great menus and things like that.  The greatest part of this dvd is the extras.  The main thing is basically a bunch of songs played live with some small interviews and clips in between.  In the extras there is more live footage, small funny clips, a tour of the tourbus with Jose (this is really funny), the 7 music videos they've had so far, a few other small things, and the coolest thing is the Akoostic Kali, which is 4 songs played acoustically (Clean, A Certain Shade of Green, The Warmth, and Summer Romance.) They are all great, the only thing that I don't like about it is that they didn't include any more acoustic things from that session because they actually played like 15 songs.  Oh well, thats what the Morning View Sessions is for, but check out this DVD you'll love it."],["First of all this is a good DVD though there are some downsides to it.  For instance as someone else mention you have to click a lot of things individually so it gets obnoxious.  For instnace if you go into the index (which plays this god-awful noise over and over and over and over (you get the idea)) and click on the acoustic tracks, some of them will play just that song, some will play all the acoustic tracks-it's just really crazy.

After about a month of watching the movie she can recognize most of her numbers but still does not really understand conceptually what they mean.  In the video there is a song for each number 1-10..for example, number 2 is a song about two dogs playing and shows pairs of dogs running around.  But then several of the songs don't even show the right number of objects.  Like number 7 song is supposed to be about 7 llamas, but in the video it only shows like 3-5 llamas.  The songs are mind-numbing to me, but do keep our daughter and our 1-year old son entertained with the songs, even if they're not really learning counting.  Also, the movie is a super low-budget production, which normally would not bother me, but there are a few clips that are recycled through the video and hokey animated characters walking across the screen all the time.  I would not recommend this to a friend as a good product for teaching counting and there are definitely better entertainment videos and more effective educational videos out there for little people."],["My daughter loved all the Baby Genius videos.

We haven't exposed him to much in the way of DVDs yet, but have also played \"Baby Animals\" and it does not interest him as much.  I think it's because the tunes aren't as catchy.This DVD has been great for us because (1) he is learning words, and there are many opportunities in this video to practice them... bird, baby, dog, balloon, horse, boat, robot, etc.  (2) the videos themselves may not be high-production, but they have an interesting variety of content and I can certainly see why they are entertaining for my 1-year old to watch, in a good way (3) each little song/video is introduced with a chime that cues his continued interest -The reviews were few and tepid, so I have felt compelled to offer that this is a fun, positive DVD in our house that currently gets played daily --"],["My 3 yr old already knows his numbers but for some reason he really likes this video the best out of all the Baby Genius videos.  At least once a day he will say \"number 1 is fun - 1, 1, 1!\"  I disagree with another reviewer in that I think the video teaches number recognition as well as the concept - e.g. for the number \"2\" there are 2 dogs running on the beach. So you see the number 2, see two dogs running on the beach and the song starts with \"two happy dogs, run run run....\" I like it because it offers an opportunity to discuss what's happening -- actions, prepositions, etc. -- in each segment with real kids/people and not animated ones."],["A fun take on learning numbers and objects.

I'll be the first to admit that I have not seen every SummerSlam, but this HAS to be worst!!Kane vs. FinleyHorrible chemistry between the two of them. Kane meshes well with brawlers, and Finley works better with wrestlers who can actually, um, WRESTLE. This match was hardly Smackdown! material.Triple Threat for the IC titleUmaga vs. Kennedy vs. CarlitoI guess this pay-per-view was during the few weeks Jeff Hardy was gone. Three heels in an Intercontinental Title Match, wow, great marketing WWE!!I should have known that Umaga wasn't going to work well with Kennedy and Carlito. This match was missing a fan favorite, even though it sucked for different reasons.Rey Mysterio vs. ChavoSo, Mysterio won, shocker!! Welcome back, Rey, I missed you. But this was the worst match that you and Chavo have put on.WWE Diva Battle RoyalWaste of time...Why wasn't the title defended??MVP and Matt Hardy in a beer drinking contest featuring Stone Cold Steve AustinIt was nice to see Austin, but MVP and Matt (along with Rey) are the ONLY reasons I watch Smackdown!! and they could have at least wrestled.ECW Championship MatchJohn Morrison vs. CM PunkOkay, so Morrison and Punk aren't EXTREME. So, why are they wrestling for this belt? I've seen the two of them wrestle on ECW and out of the three matches I've seen, the ones on television were A LOT better. Good wrestling matches, but they were NOT extreme. This fued is probably better suited for the IC or US title.Triple H vs. King BookerBooker's last match with the WWE was NOT a great one. Triple H and Booker's match at Wrestlemania a few years ago was A LOT better. Welcome back, Triple H., thanks for screwing Bret and thanks for another mediocre match.World Heavyweight TitleGreat Khali vs. BatistaThese two have to be the worst \"wrestlers\" in WWE history.

Also look out for some comedic moments as well involving the Crusierweight Champion.Intercontinental Champion Umaga vs. Mr. Kennedy vs. Carlito - This was a fun triple threat with both Kennedy & Carlito always targeting Umaga whenever he was in the ring showing he was the main threat in the match by going to the extreme like hitting him with the monitor, kicking his head into the steps & trying to double team him various times in the match.  Good effort from all 3 men involved.Rey Mysterio vs. Chavo Guerrero - Before I get started, what was Rey thinking with that bodypaint?  He came off as someone who forgot to rub in his lotion instead of the intended \"Silver Surfer\" character.  This surpassed their match last year but not their greatest encounter (which I thought was their Bash '04 match).  Chavo working on Rey's leg that he injured a year ago & Rey heavily selling it made for good inring storytelling.Divas Battle Royal - This wasn't a straight T&A; segment and was actually a nice little battle royal as well.  Nothing noteworthy but enjoyable.Right around here was a segment involving a beer drinking contest between MVP & Matt Hardy's substitute & the star of The Condemned...\"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin that resulted in the usual...Austin stunning the guy & having a beer bash.ECW Champion John Morrison vs. CM Punk - I'm sorry but the DVD I rented had a bad scratch on this match & kept skipping so I can't comment.Triple H vs. King Booker - Booker got a shot here & there but for the most part, he was just a body for Triple H to dominate & defeat in his return.World Champion Great Khali vs. Batista - This was awful & boring...in other words, your typical Khali match.  Being an \"attraction wrestler\" can't carry your behind when the bell rings if your opposition isn't a spot money, which Batista isn't.WWE Champion John Cena vs. Randy Orton - This had the crowd the hottest they've been non-stop all night during a match.  Orton & Cena meshed well here together to give you a match that I enjoyed despite what happened in the last 3 seconds & who got their hand raised.  It went back & forth with Orton bringing forth his best inring effort I've seen in months while Cena broke out of his sterotypical \"5 holds\" moveset with holds like a legdrop drop the top rope & even his old \"throwback\" hangman's neckbreaker.  Great match & effort from both men.DVD extras include the ending to the SmackDown Khali vs. Kane match before the PPV & Triple H's return to RAW the next night during Carlito's Cabana guest startting Mr. McMahon.In the end, this PPV under any other circumstances would be just an average PPV but concidering the very LOW quality of PPV's that WWE has been cranking out since Backlash...this looks alot better in comparison.

Pity.No classic matches like Bret Hart vs. Mr. Perfect or Bret Hart vs. Steve Austin.It's the new millennium, John Cena is World Champion, and Great Khali plays Yokozuna II. Bad omen, huh?Kane vs. FinlayIn the recent years, Kane continuously switches between Midcard and superstar. And that is not good. We've seen the resurrection of the Undertaker roughly 10 times in the last three years, maybe it would be wise to do the same with Kane, and slip his mask back on his head. He just reminds me of King Of Queens' Spence Olchin way too much.Fit Finlay on the other hand entered WWE as a midcarder, and that fits nicely; always on the level of good, solid, mediocrity. Of course he's a terrific WRESTLER, but what can you do with wrestling nowadays in WWE?2/5Umaga (IC Champ) vs. Kennedy vs. CarlitoCan't stand Kennedy, can't find Carlito amusing, and Umaga doesn't connect with the crowd. The recent three way matches are getting shorter,  increasingly strange, and very uncoordinated. And you should have at least one guy who is able to carry an opponent. Ideally, this should be the champion, but Umaga is too clumsy for that. And Carlito got this title match how? Flair- connection?2/5Rey Misterio vs. Chavo GuerreroRey Misterio is another example of someone who can't seem to decide whether he wants to be a midcarder or a superstar. And I'm so glad they dropped the whole Eddie Guerrero storyline, so that's a big plus before the match even started.The match itself didn't have much of a cruiserweight battle, largely because of Chavo. Did you ever notice that Mexican or Japanese cruiserweights, as soon as they enter WWE, immediately lose half of their fire? Apparently someone thinks you have a good highflying match when you see one or two Hurancanranas.3/5WWE Diva Battle RoyalOh, for the love of god, no! It's painful enough to sit through the Women's Title match every three weeks, but, no pun intended, a \"buttload\" of Divas having ... an actual battle royal? I mean, look at Torrie Wilson performing a running splash in the corner - you can actually see her thinking just about not damaging her implants.-2/5At that point, MVP entered the ring, challenging Matt Hardy for a beer drinking contest.Matt introduced his replacement, Steve Austin. Come on, could you folks please just leave the retired superstars alone, and not reduce them to something like this? I'm so very glad the three most important superstars, The Rock, Hogan and Bret Hart have the decency and good judgement to stay at home.And besides, Austion looks like he had a couple of beer drinking contests too much.Austin drinks some beer, gives two stunners, and leaves. That made absolutely zero sense, and isn't even entertaining. Because it made zero sense.0/5John Morrison (ECW Champ) vs. CM PunkDoes anybody in WWE's \"high offices\" have any idea what \"ECW\" stands for (or stood for, whatever you prefer)? Clearly not. How pathetic is it that a match for the ECW title ends with disqualification because one of the contestants used a chair? That didn't happen in this match, but it DID happen.I mean, these two rather dull clowns come out, exchange some generic moves, and as soon as Morrison has Punk in a 20 minute headlock, the former ECW viewer just has to go \"what the friggin' hell ...?\"ECW in this shape hurts WWE.1/5Triple H vs. King BookerLet's not kid around, this match was solely there to celebrate the return of Triple H, and it didn't have other purpose - to witness on DVD. It's a good thing it had that bonus because the match itself was a disaster. Barely longer than five minutes, neither Booker nor Triple H made any significant impact. The ending was an acrobatic catastrophe.And I can't help but think that HHH's return was a little overhyped.2/5, to be very generous.World Heavyweight TitleGreat Khali vs. BatistaHoly hell, somebody take the title from that 7 foot stain on World Wrestling Entertainment history! At least Andre The Giant was fascinating and charismatic. This was the worst title match (ANY title) in recent memory. After roughly three minutes, Khali takes a chair and hits Batista. DQ victory for the Animal. One question: WTF?-4/5WWE Championship MatchJohn Cena vs. Randy OrtonYou can't expect justice in John Cena matches anymore, but at the very least you can count that the crowd is into it. Simply because it's about time Cena gives the title to someone. I mean, at this point, why even bother to build an opponent? Does John Cena need more build up? After beating Triple H, Shawn Michaels, Randy Orton, JBL, 1-2-3? Numerous times.At this point, watching a Cena match like this one is simply ridiculous! He's beat, wait, not yet ... but now, now, now he's definitely out. Hey, FU, he won!3/5This Summerslam surely was nothing to be proud of, but it's enough to satisfy people. Not bad, not great, somewhere right down in the middle of solid mediocrity.The best thing was Vince McMahon being called \"Vinne - CENzo!\""],["This was the 20th annual Summerslam PPV, and I was expecting it to be spectacular and feature some of the greatest 5-star matches I've ever seen. Well, I didn't see any 5-Star matches, but I did see some pretty good ones, but 2 VERY horrible main events.Kane Vs. FinlayThis match was just thrown on there at the very last minute for some reason. This feud, if it was a feud, didn't even get started. It didn't even have hornswaggle! I love Finlay and Kane, but these 2 don't work well together in a match. Still it was a decent opener. 6/10Diva Battle RoyalI don't really keep up with ANY of the diva matches, all I know is that this was an okay match seeing a LOT of divas trying their best to win. It was just a filler to poddibly give the Women's division a boost. 5/10Triple Threat for the Intercontinental title: Umaga Vs. Carlito Vs. KennedyThis match was very short, but oh so very sweet. I loved this match and is one of the few contenders for Match of the night. Pretty fast paced action, and one of the very few matches where I don't know who to cheer for. Even though Umaga retained, I was still pulling for either of them. Although, it would have been really cool if Kennedy won. But it was very nice seeing Carlito and Kennedy hold their own against Kennedy. It would have been better if it was longer. 8/10STONE COLD! This segment was worth it alone, seeing Stone Cold come out to a chalening MVP in a beer drinking contest! The only suprise was that Matt Hardy didn't get stunnered, but it was nice seeing Stone cold arrive, drink beer, kick a**, leave. Too bad the US title match was scrapped because of MVP's heart condidition.Rey Mysterio Vs. ChavoThis was a very great return match. It was fast paced, and full of crusierweight action. Chavo and Rey have the ability to put on the best dang show, and these 2 work really well together. Nice to see Rey back in the ring. 7.5/10ECW Championship: John Morrison (c) Vs. CM PunkThis was definately the best match I have seen from their long feud. It was more fast-paced, and action packed than ever. You really got to see the ROH side of CM Punk in this match. Amazing moves, and I'm glad Morrison retains because he is seriously the best thing ECW has right now, and is the furture of WWE. another Match of the night contender. 8.5/10Triple H Vs. King BookerI was so happy to see HHH back in the ring, and it was weird seeing him with fans seeing as how he was always the heel character, and people never cheer them. Booker T is amazing in the ring, as well as HHH, but he really needs to go back to being Booker T, the King gimmick is way overdone, and only Kurt Angle played the \"king\" role good. Anyways, this match was very good, and nothing like normal return matches. you got to see the best of both of their abilities, and the best of their signature moves. It was a WMXIX rematch, and was very great. On the short side though. The last contender for Match of the Night. 8.5/10World Heavyweight Championship: Khali (c) Vs. BatistaWhat the heck? These 2 can't carry a match for the life of them, so why put them in a match together? And how many more times will we see Batista get a title shot and lose? I'm so tired of seeing Batista, he is stale and isn't as good as he was before the injury. Khali is a huge waste of space, and can't wrestle, so why did WWE decide to give him the gold? This match was terrible. 7 minutes long, and 3 1/2 was a lame shoulder grip by Khali. Terrible, terrible match. 3/10WWE Title match: John Cena (c) Vs. randy OrtonWell, I wasn't upset with thismatch. I wanted Randy to win, but I knew it wasn't gonna happen because Cena overcame the odds, again. I'm so tired of Cena having the stupid spinner title, it's making me not want to watch WWE at all. This match was very good however. I was so glad to see these 2 finally put in a match against eachother since they came to WWE the same time. Too many headlocks form Randy, but it was a great bakc and forth match. pretty fast-paced and Randy pretty much had Cena down the whole match, but, as always, Cena pulled the 5 moves of doom out and won. I'm not complaining because this match was pretty good, but please give someone else the belt! 7/10So overall, this PPV was good. 2 weak PPV's, but 3 VERY good matches and a few decent ones. I would suggest buying this DVD when its at a reasonable used price. The triple threat, HHH return, Stone Cold, and Morrison/Punk match are worth it.I compare this to Summerslam 2002, a VERY weak main event, but the undercard is what makes the PPV awesome. overall, I give this PPV a 7.5/10.This was my first Review,too. tell me what you tihnk of it :)"],["Kane vs Finlay: This was one of the least predictable matches of the night since I expected Finlay to win. Finlay gets a close fall after hitting Kane in his injured ribs with his weapon that I can't spell lol. Kane eventually wins after a chokeslam. 7 out of 10Kennedy vs Carlito vs Umaga: Carlito and Kennedy only get near falls when Umaga is laid out outside the ring. Kennedy almost wins but Umaga breaks up the pin on Carlito and right away hits the Samoan Spike on Kennedy for the win. 7 out of 10Chavo Guerrero vs Rey Mysterio: In  possibly the best match of the night Rey comes out painted with grey pants and a grey mask. They get many near falls on each othher. Match comes to an end when Rey hits the 6:19 kick on Chavo and splashes him for the win. Despite it being obvious Rey would win from the start, it was still a solid match. 9 out of 10C.M Punk vs John Morrison: Back and forth action with many reversals but the wrong person won this one. Morrison pins Punk after having his feet on the ropes. Morrison has some good matches but Punk deserves to be ECW champ way more. 8 out of 10King Booker vs Triple: This is a really good match although it was obvious that Triple H wouldn't put Booker over his first match back. The 2 had a better match at one WM but still this is one of the best matches of the night anyway. End comes when Booker fights his way out of a Pedigree but quickly gets hit with one when Triple H trys again. 9 out of 10Batista vs The Great Khali: Batista gets shot after shot after shot until he wins the title. So I expected him to win but gee....will he get yet another shot at Unforgiven....um duh...Obviously! Khali controlled the match but gets himself DQ'd for no good reason. So the title matches were disapoiting. 6 out of 10Orton vs Cena: I'll just start out by saying ORTON SHOULD'VE WON!! Hell anyway who has versed Cena for the last year in title matches should've beat him! Well except the Great Khali and Umaga. The belt is basically on reserve for Triple H though since I'm already hearing that Cena vs Triple H 2 will happen at WM. So yes we have to put up with Cena's horrible reighn until then! When the 2 Mcmahon's meet, Triple H is married to Stephanie \"why he's pushed so hard\" and Cena must be married to Shane to have the title this long lol.Orton hits the RKO and SHOULD'Ve won but when he goes for another the overpushed and annoying Cena hits the FU for the win *PUKES*. Still despite being 100% tired of Cena's reighn, I admit it was a very good match and very watchable but due to me really really wanting Orton to win. 8 out of 10It sucks that not even one title changed, matches that weren't title matches were surprisingly show stealers."],["This PPV was just really bad from top to bottomCena vs Orton far below expectationsKhali vs Batista HORRIBLE ATROCIOUSChavo Vs Rey Mysterio decent but they cant touch the bar they set back in WCW for great matches theses daysBooker vs HHH glorified squash for the returning HHHUmaga vs Carlito vs Mr. Kennedy decentPunk vs Morrison best of the night two future main event starsDiva Battle Royal Divas havnt been the same since Trish and Lita leftoverall just an atrocious Summerslam pass on it"],["The 20th Summerslam PPV extravaganza featured three PPV quality matches among many average ones. PPV quality matches feature near falls, good in-ring chemistry, good counter wrestling, tell a good story, and have a solid finish. The three matches that had all these key elements were Cena vs. Orton, HHH vs. KING BOOKA , and Rey Mysterio vs. OOOOO CHAVO! I was somewhat disappointed by the rest of the card, especially by the Batista/Khali match. Khali is just hurting WWE's image....period. I could have easily seen the same exact match on friday night smackdown or monday night raw. The same goes for the other matches on the card like finlay vs. kane and the triple threat intercontinental title match. I'm not saying that these guys are poor wrestlers. These matches just did not meet PPV standards. IF you look at past Summerslam events, this one ranks a little farther down the list. WWE just does not have the star power it had five or six years ago. But more importantly, wwe needs to do a better job of building up some of their matches, especially for a major event like summerslam."],["The biggest party of the summer is nice but it wasn't great.Kane vs. FinlayThis match was only added to the pay per view two days before on smack down, so it was like a filler opener match. This match was real physical. Finlay works on Kane's leg and ribs through the match. Kane entertained the crowd while Finlay did his thing witch made this actually good. 6 /10Triple Threat matchWWE Intercontinental Championship matchKen Kennedy vs. Carlito vs. UmagaThis was interesting because there was only heels in this match. I think it would have been better if they added Jeff. Still this was good but not the best triple threat match. The crowd was cheering for Kennedy in this match. Him and Carlito double team Umaga but he comes back an wins. Okay match. 7/10Chavo vs Rey MisterioThis was Rey's return match and he came looking weird cover in something and at first I didn't think that was him until all that stuff rubbed off. Any way, this match was awesome. Rey did some nice high flying moves while Chavo worked on his injured leg. I would say this was match of the night. 8/10Divas Inventional Battle RoyalThis match was just a waste of time. They should of just added something else ton the ppv so people can forget about this. 2/10ECW Championship matchJohn Morrison vs. CM PunkThis match was cool. This hole Morrison gimmick thing is okay. The both of them do a good job with their fued and they put on some good matches together. I wished it could have been extreme rules match but oh well. 7.5/10Triple H vs. King BookerThis was Triple H return match and King Booker's last match on a WWE ppv. This match was hyped over many weeks and it felt like the match could have been a lot better. I liked to see Booker do the Houston hangover because I haven't seen him do that in a while. Okay match. 7/10World Heavyweight matchThe Great Khali vs. BatistaThey should of added a gimmick to this match like a no dq match of some thing hardcore to take the place for the ECW match. It was boring just like the crowd said. 1/10WWE Championship matchJohn Cena vs. Randy OrtonThis match was nice. Randy showed off his skills real good. Cena did yet his usual things in this match. I really thought Randy was going to win but no. Still very good match.8/10Okay ppv but could have been better."],["80-76%-perfect75-71%-awsome70-66%-good65-61%-poor60-56%-awful1. Kane vs. Finlay- This was a decent way to start the show. I would have thought that rey and chavo would have kicked off the show but it was a good choice because that's what kicked off last years summerslam. These two tried the best they could and for there age I will give them a good job. There was even a nice near fall were finlay hit Kane with the Shleghi but Kane kicked out. A decent way to kick off the show. Winner Kane. Match Rating 6/10.2. Umaga vs. Mr. Kennedy vs. Carlito in a triple threat match for the ITC Title- I thought that this was a decent match. These guys put on a decent show and it kept me on the edge of my seat because I thought that Kennedy could possibly win. Just some slid wrestling and lots of near falls but the ending was kind of dumb but besides that a good match. Winner and still ITC Champ Umaga. Match Rating 7/10.3. Rey Mysterio vs. Chavo Guerrero- This was a good match. I liked this match a lot better than last year's just because it had more hype behind it and I thought that it was better wrestling wise. There was a lot of work on the knee but Rey kept on fighting back and there were a lot of near falls including Rey Kicking out of a Gorry Bomb. A great return for Rey. Winner Rey Mysterio. Match Rating 8/10.4. The Divas Battle Royal for the # 1 contender for the WWE Womens Title- Well I was not expecting a lot in this match and it was not good at all. I don't like battle royals a lot anyway but when it's a Divas one its not any better. Just no wrestling here at all and a bore fest but at least we have a new challenger for the womens title. Winner Beth Phoenix. Match Rating 2/10.5. John Morrison vs. CMP for the ECW World Heavywieght Title- Well I was really looking forward to this match as I was almost sure that CMP was going to win the title. This was a solid match for a while but could have been a little longer. I always thought Morrison had talent but I thought that CMP carried this match. A solid match but a dumb ending ruined this match. Winner and still ECW Champ John Morrison. Match Rating 6.5/10.6. HHH vs. King Booker with Sharmel- This was a decent match. It was nice to see HHH return as he got a huge ovation. This was a decent match what I think took away from this was we all knew that HHH was not going to lose so it took away from the match but wrestling wise it was solid. Not a bad match. Winner HHH. Match Rating 7/10.7. The Great Kalhi vs. Batistia for the WHT- Well I did not see the triple threat match at the great American Bash but I heard it was good. Well this match was totally different. This was boring as the great kalhi controlled most of the match. There was a nice near fall were batistia kicked out of Kalhi's finisher but only to lead to a DQ after Kalhi hit Batistia with a steel chair. Not a good match. Winner by DQ Batistia. Match Rating 2/10.8. John Cena vs. Randy Orton for the WWE Title- Well this was the main event and it was not a bad one. The hype going into this match was off the chain as a lot of people believed that Orton was going to win the title. The reaction to Cena was one of the worst I have seen in a while so many Cena sucks chants, break his neck, and Cena must die and I loved it. This was a solid match with some near falls and it lived up to the hype for me. Cena wins again and the reason everyone hates him so much is he wins every single time. Oh well still a good match. Winner and still WWE Champ Randy Orton. Match Rating 8.5/10.Well that raps up another. I would give Summerslam 2007 a grade of 47.80 which means this is an awful ppv. I would not say this is an awful ppv but there is no dought that the WHT match and the diva battle royal hurt the score. I will say that it is not a bad dvd to pick up for $15 dollars when it comes out. If you can tell me if my review was helpful or not I would appreciate that.

Which is a shock since Punk and Morrison have put on good bouts in the past. Morrison wins again for the third time, why can't Punk get a title win? Is he still in the doghouse with the WWE? I kinda figured Morrison would win since they had a vignette over him before the match and not any mention on Punk. Ok match, but kind of a letdown.)Another Raw promo.Backstage The Great Khali and Batista are shown on split screens.MATCH 6: King Booker with Queen Sharmell vs. Triple H(My Prediction: Triple H)Fireworks go off as Triple H makes his long awaited return.

Welcome back Game!)Triple H poses for the crowd as the game says it doesn't get any better than this.Another Unforgiven promo.MATCH 7: World Heavyweight Championship:(Champion) The Great Khali with Runjin Singh vs. Batista(My Prediction: Either Khali by pinfall or Batista by disqualification)Khali kicks away at Batista in the corner.

Batista gets the chair and begins swinging away at Khali repeatedly.The Condemned is coming to DVD on September 18.Backstage is Vince and Coach.

Orton covers, one, two, no only two! Cena then lifts up Orton and nails the FU out of knowhere for the win!Winner: John CenaRating: *** 1/4 (Good main event, although I expect a **** (four star) match for some reason. But all of those sleeperholds from Orton brought down the rating a bit. Orton has the potential to be a main event status champion, while Cena is still of course whether or not some fans want to admit it, the champ of the WWE!)OVERALL: SummerSlam wasn't what I would call the biggest party of the Summer! It wasn't that bad either but after the Diva Battle Royal things went downhill but picked up by the main event. The first three matches and the main event is the matches I'd say go see although there wasn't"],["2007 SummerslamAugust 26, 2007Continental Airlines ArenaEast Rutherford, New JerseyKane V. Finlayok opener here. Just your average match with nothing note worhtly. Kane wins. **1/4Triple Threat Match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship:Umaga (Champion) V. Mr Kennedy V. Carlitogood match but should have been one-on-one with Umaga and Kennedy. Carlito really does nothing here. Again, good match, watchable, but let's about it. **3/4Rey Mysterio V. Chavo GuerreroThe return of Rey and what a return! great match here with great in ring work and storytelling. Of course Rey wins in his return. ***3/4. Chavo was very good as a heel here. If with the right people, he could be a main event heel...HAHAHAHA...joking. But, Chavo is dieing in his position now. He is better than what people give him credit for.Interpromotional Divas Battle Royal:Winner Get A Women's Championship MatchMickie James V. Jillian Hall V. Beth Phoenix V. Kelly Kelly V. maria V. Michelle McCool V. Torrie Wilson V. Kristal V. Layla V. Brooke V. Melina V. VictoriaGoddamn, that's alot of names for a short review. Beth Phoenix wins in a match that was better looking at the ladies than the in ring work. DUDECW Championship:John Morrison (Champion) V. CM PunkI really don't get why they keep putting those two together, they have no chemistry at all. This is the three straight PPV that those two have worked together and all the matches have sucked and this one was no different. Just barely watchable because of Punk and Morrison is a better tag team wrestler than singles wrestler. Morrison wins by cheating. *1/2Triple H V. King BookerThe return of The Game and I was actaully disappointed. This match was good, but not as good as their WrestleMania XIX match. Booker was on his way out and his effort wasn't there and Triple H was just returning, but, this match could have been better. Triple H wins. ***World Heavyweight Championship:Great Khali (Champion) V. BatistaJust one word. Horrible. This is the third straight Summerslam with horrible World Heavyweight Title matches and Batista has been in them all. Batista wins by DQ after Khali destroys him for the whole match and Batista gets a spinebuster in and Khali is afraid. Big Baby. 1/4* I hope the World Heavyweight Championship match at this year's Summerslam will be alot better than 2005, 2006, and 2007. Can anyone say Punk V. Cena?????WWE Champioship:John Cena (Champion) V. Randy Ortonwhat a match!! The best WWE Championship match at a Summerslam since Angle/Lesner in 2003. Awesome storytelling and wrestling in this one. Match of the night and match of the year canadiate. Awesome. Cena retains. DAMN....NO...****Overall a so-so Summerslam. The return of Rey was great, Triple H's return was good too, but Booker sucks so you can't really say much. The WWE Championship was the best in 4 years and the other matches were just an after thought."],["Summerslam 07 was the second show I saw on PPV (I've only been a fan since early 07). I loved it at the time.But I just rewatched the show on DVD, and it's definitely not as good as I thought it was. It's just average after another view.Let's have a rundown of the card:Kane vs FinlayThis match was just ok, but it served it's purpose, which was to get the New Jersey crowd fired up for the rest of the show. Both men put a lot of effort in, with Finlay working on Kane's ribs for the majority of the match. There was a Hornswoggle appearance, and it was amusing when he saw Kane sit up and ran away. The match ended when Kane chokeslammed Finlay after a shilleagh shot that didn't keep Kane down. (3/5 - an alright match)Triple Threat Match for the Intercontinental ChampionshipUmaga (champion) vs Mr. Kennedy vs CarlitoThis match was confusing because the fans didn't know who to cheer for, as all three were heels at the time. There was a funny moment at the beginning when Kennedy tried to reason with Umaga to tell him to team up against Carlito, but Umaga just smacked Kennedy instead. Carlito & Kenndy did end up double-teaming Umaga, but Umaga overcame them both and won the match. This should have had a face in it for the fans to cheer for, but otherwise it was an ok match. (2.5/5 - confusing and nobody the fans can really cheer for)Rey Mysterio vs Chavo GuerreroThis was Rey's return match after being away since 2006. He got a great crowd reaction, but his getup was bizarre, the silver paint looked ridiculous and was coming off right from the beginning of the match. This match was really just a way for Rey to get revenge for Chavo shattering his knee. But some great moves were displayed by both men, including Chavo doing both the Gory Bomb and the three Amigos, and Rey pulling out his match winning 619. Rey picks up the win and gets his revenge. (3/5 - good return for Rey)WWE Diva Battle Royal (winner gets a WWE Women's Championship match)Maria vs Mickie James vs Beth Phoenix vs Melina vs Jillian Hall vs Torrie Wilson vs Victoria vs Michelle McCool vs Kristal vs Layla vs Kelly Kelly vs BrookeThis match was actually pretty good. It was a way to get all the divas involved (Candice Michelle, who was champion, watched from ringside) in the PPV. Some good wrestling moves were displayed, mainly from divas like Mickie, Melina & Beth. However Mickie was eliminated too early. Michelle did do an impressive kick to Beth as the last two divas remaining. Beth eliminated Michelle to win. An amusing element is King's commentary, especially when he says \"JR, you'll have to do most of the commentary because my smile is permanently affixed to my face\" and when he says his eyeballs are happy. (3.5/5 - much better then the usual divas stuff and King is funny)Between the divas and the next match was a segment between MVP and Matt Hardy. MVP complained he was left out of Summerslam, and then said he was \"lowering\" himself to have a beer drinking contest with Matt Hardy. Matt came out and told MVP he'd arranged a substitute. The glass broke, and the great Stone Cold came out! He mocked MVP for a minute, and then stunned him and had a beer bash. It was great seeing Stone Cold as usual, he's always welcome on a WWE PPV to me.ECW Championship MatchJohn Morrison (champion) vs CM PunkMorrison & Punk had some great matches in 2007, but this definitely not one of the best. It was rather boring to be honest, and I found myself wanting it to be over. No offence to either Morrison or Punk though. In the end, Morrison pulled out the victory. (2/5 - a very dull match in my opinion)Triple H vs King BookerThis match was a way to welcome Triple H back from injury and for Booker to get his comeuppance after all his antics on Raw in the weeks leading up to Summerslam. The funniest thing about this match was King and JR's commentary, they were totally biased against Booker, hoping he'd lose. A funny line was when King commented that someday Booker might have a knee injury and asked JR if he'd miss him, to which JR replied, curtly, \"No.\" Triple H's entrance got the crowd on their feet, and he looked very pleased to be back. The match wasn't much, it was basically Triple H beating Booker up with Booker getting in the occasional shot. Triple H won, and everybody gave him a standing ovation, including King and JR. (3/5 - just for Triple H's return and King & JR's commentary)World Heavyweight Championship MatchThe Great Khali (champion) vs BatistaThis was a horrible match, not Summerslam standard AT ALL. Khali is a bad wrestler, and Batista didn't have much to work with here. The only memorable moments were Batista's spinebuster on Khali and the spear after the match was over. Speaking of the end, it was a total cop-out on Khali's part. He hit Batista with a chair and got disqualified. A DQ in a Summerslam main event? Ridiculous. Batista went nuts after the DQ and hit Khali with the chair numerous times. Not good at all. (2/5 - what were they thinking with the ending?!)WWE Championship MatchJohn Cena (champion) vs Randy OrtonThis match saved the PPV for me. It's easily the best match John & Randy have had together. The crowd was also into it, the amount of varying shouts for both John & Randy were tremendous (Let's Go Cena! Cena Sucks! Let's Go Orton! Orton Sucks!). But the crowd couldn't make up their minds. First they booed John, then after the match's conclusion, they cheered him. The match itself was pretty good, but Randy needs to lay off the lengthy headlocks, they're NOT entertaining at all. John kept the pace going, and when Randy hit the RKO I jumped out of my seat because I thought he was going to win (I'm a John fan, so I didn't want him to win). But then John hit the FU and won the match. A good main event that saved the PPV from 2 stars. (4/5 - marked down a star cos of Randy's headlocks, but still very good)There's two extras on the DVD, one is a match from Smackdown with Kane vs The Great Khali - the match comes in at the end, so it's really more of the aftermath of the match, where Khali beats Kane, Finlay comes out and hits Kane with the shilleagh and then Batista runs out and attacks Khali, but Khali applies the vice grip on him and he passes out. The other extra is Carlito's Cabana  from Raw with Triple H & Vince McMahon. It's hilarious cos Triple H is up to his usual tricks, and brings out numerous women who could have had Vince's son - one of them is Carlito's \"sister\" and one is actually a man. Vince is horrified, then leaves the ring after telling Triple H he hates him, Carlito then spits apple in Triple H's face, so Triple H attacks him. Very funny stuff.Overall, this was just an average Summerslam. It wasn't outstanding, but it wasn't horrible either. The SD main event was easily the worst match of the night, the Raw main event was the best. Everything else was either good (Triple H's return), alright (divas battle royal, Rey vs Chavo & Kane vs Finlay) or confusing (Intercontinental match). I give it 3 stars."],["WWE ChampionshipJohn Cena(c) vs Randy OrtonWorld Heavyweight ChampionshipThe Great Khali(c) vs BatistaECW World ChampionshipJohn Morrison(c) vs CM PunkHHH vs King BookerRey Mysterio vs Chavo GuerreroBobby Lashley vs CarlitoIntercontinental TitleUmaga(c) vs Jeff HardyUnited States TitleMVP(c) vs Matt HardyWomen's TitleCandice(c) vs Beth Phoenix vs Melina vs Mickie James"]],"title":"WWE SummerSlam 2007","total_reviews":21,"sentiment":0.6984142857,"label":"positive","best_review":["I was so glad to get this dvd, and at such a great price.

So much for kayfabe."],["The History of the WWE Championship is pretty straightfoward. It is a compilation of the most famous matches for the beloved WWE Championship, tracing back to 1971. This is the best WWE DVD product that has been offered since \"The Ultimate Ric Flair Collection\" a few years back.Hosted by WWE Hall of Famer Jim Ross, this collection includes the greatest champions in WWE history all in action, including Bruno Sammartino, \"Superstar\" Billy Graham, Hulk Hogan, Bret \"Hitman\" Hart, Shawn Michaels, Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, Triple H, The Undertaker, Kurt Angle and John Cena. This DVD really hits home, and includes a nice timeline of all the title holders and the dates of their respective reigns, plus a bonus video clip section which highlights every title change up until Edge's victory in July, 2006. Ross's narration also touches on the changing of the eras in WWE history, from the old days of Bruno and Billy Graham through the Hulkamania and Attitude eras up to the brand extension era of today. An amazing, amazing set despite those who have complained that a lot of these matches are already on other DVDs. If it is truly a great WWE Title match, then it should be on the DVD, regardless of how many times it has been released before. If they were not included in this set, then people would complain that they are not there. That is why it is called the \"HISTORY\" of the WWE Title, not \"The Matches Never Put on DVD Before\". Why complain when WWE has finally given us something this good?Almost all of the matches are great, but the best of the best include:Bruno Sammartino vs. Killer KowalskiHulk Hogan vs. Ultimate Warrior, WrestleMania VIBret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels, WrestleMania XIIShawn Michaels vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin, WrestleMania XIVThe Rock vs. Triple H vs. Kurt Angle, SummerSlam 2000The Rock vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin, WrestleMania X7The Rock vs. Undertaker vs. Kurt Angle,rarely seen match from Vengeance 02, andKurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit, Royal Rumble 2003.This is truly the greatest compilation of matches assembled into one 3-disc set.

And yes, many of the matches shown here have been on other DVD compilations...however, many of them are some of the best WWF/WWE championship matches ever. For example, the Bret/Owen steel cage match may have been on the Best Steel Cage Matches DVD, but some people might not have bought that and plus, it's an unbelievable match anyway.In addition, there are many older matches on this DVD that haven't been released previously on DVD, so for older wrestling fans, it should be a treat.Every title change is covered in some way, shape, or form, so it has the makings of being a very nostalgic and comprehensive set. I am definitely going to buy this, and I recommend it to everyone who loves the WWF/WWE as much as I do."],["Use a match on one dvd and check it off. Im sick of WWE putting out the same matches, there is too many excellent missing world title matches to name that is missing."],["This would be a frickin AWESOME collection if it had the tournament from WrestleMania III. If this is supposed to be an accurate history of the title, I would think that epic and unprecedented event would be in the forefront. That cage match with Hogan and Bundy at WMII was paltry at best.

I do wish they would include some personal accounts throughout the matches but in a pinch, this dvd collection will do."],["As good as most WWE DVDs are, they have a very annoying nack of dubbing over entrance music (if they include the entrances of matches at all), dubbing out Benoit's name during commentary (when they include a Benoit match), etc....... SO before I make the decision of purchasing this DVD set I would like to know what entrances have been dubbed over or left out.I would also like to note that the WWE usually does those things above in MOST if not ALL of their dvds ON PURPOSE for reasons unknown, and those dvd negatives above are usually NOT listed in reviews for WWE DVDS, and the last times when I simply try to warn people on Amazon about being careful when purchasing a WWE DVD set, my 1st Amendment Right (to free speech) gets violated by Amazon barring me from posting discussions because I'm \"not withing good standings\" within the Amazon community, so you guys be the judge.Honest feedback would be appreciated =)"],["Overall, I'm quite pleased with this collection. But, of course, there are always some additional matches I'd have liked to have included.  They areBruno Sammartino's win over Buddy Rogers. It only took 48 seconds.  But, it's historic enough to warrant inclusion, assuming footage exists.  Bruno was the first true WWWF champ.  Rogers had been the NWA World heavyweight champ and the breakaway WWWF refused to recognize his title loss.Ivan Koloff's win over Bruno.  Ivan turned out to be a minor champ.  But, he ended a title reign of nearly 8 years and shocked wrestling fans.  Again, it's historic enough to be included.Bret Hart's win over Ric Flair.

When I speak of the Hart dvd I of course am talking about the Iron Man match but I can understand why Bret didn't want to put that match on there.  Him and Shawn Michaels has a great deal of hatred for each other that goes beyond the ring and into each other's personal lives.  I also see some other matches that I have heard about but never got a chance to see since at the time I didn't have UPN or I didn't have the money to order PPV.  One particular match was one that Benoit talked about on his dvd which was with The Rock.  Since at that time and still today Benoit can have a great match withone it should be a great match and I for one will enjoy it.  I will definitley be going to Walmart to buy this dvd especially since it is hard to find these matches these days unless you have WWE 24-7 which I don't have, the best of dvds which I also don't have, some of the matches on individual dvds which I do have three of them.  The only match that I don't see listed and I might have missed it is the Undertaker and Yokozuna's casket match from the Survior Series and The Under taker and Bret Hart's first title match at Royal Rumble which both of those matches are classic matches."],["dvds are fine but the cassing was not there, it cam in portable disc holders kinda bugs me and not happy"],["The WWE is very fun, but making the time to follow it can be challenging.

I'd have liked to see some of the lesser known matches with some behind the scenes insight."],["NOTE: I edited this review in 2012 and because I don't have this set anymore, I'm unable to review the early matches on this set.In my opinion, WWE is the biggest & most important professional wrestling (or \"sports entertainment\") company in the world today & has been for decades with their top prize being their WWE Championship.  I don't need to go into the relevance & importance of the championship as we already know the list of names who have held this championship along with the relevance of being the champion both in the ring & to the outside media of the company.  WWE released this collection of matches picked from a fan vote on their website (a subject I'll tackle later) that is hosted by Jim Ross who gives a time line of the different champions & title changes from the previous match to the next one.Various Matches Include:WWE Champion Ivan Koloff vs. Pedro Morales - Jim Ross does the commentary on this match that started out with Ivan Koloff stalling in the beginning before Pedro gained the advantage showing his superior quickness causing Ivan to ground him with a chinlock & various kicks to the face keeping the momentum slow working over Pedro's back with a bear hug to the point where Pedro's back gave out on him during a second slam but Pedro kept fighting back to the point taking advantage of where he was in the ring.Feb. '71[Best Of WWE At Madison Square Garden]WWE Champion Bruno Sammartino vs. Billy Graham - The first moments of the match started out with both men having more than one test of strength before each man went into their individual strategies of Graham working over the throat area with chops & using the ring ropes while Bruno kept using Graham's own momentum against him focusing on his back with strikes & power like the bearhug.  This was a good match for it's time but more about the history making result.Apr. '77[History Of WWE: 50 Years Of Sports Entertainment; 20 Years Too Soon: The \"Superstar\" Billy Graham Story]Iron Sheik vs. Hulk Hogan - Honestly, I can try to summarize this match but what can't be said about it that hasn't been said about it for over 20 years as it was pretty short & sweet with Gorilla Monsoon summarizing it perfectly, \"Hulkamania Is Here!\"\"MSG\" Jan. '84[Hulk Still Rules; Hulk Hogan: The Ultimate Anthology; Greatest Wrestling Stars Of The 80's]Steel Cage Match: Hulk Hogan vs. King Kong Bundy - I believe this was the debut of the \"big blue\" steel cage that WWE would use for the over the next decade until the \"Attitude Era.\"  Hogan came into the match with injured ribs as he was dominate early before Bundy was able to target the ribs with various stomps & slams along with ramming them into the cage while also using the tape around Hogan's ribs to choke him.  Hogan was able to regain some momentum sending Bundy into the cage busting him open but still wasn't able to keep it as his ribs continued to give out on him with Bundy capitalizing with an Avalanche before Hogan was finally able to \"Hulk Up\" against Bundy.  This was your typical \"Hogan\" main event for this time with a special bonus afterwords when he was able to get his hands on Bobby Heenan.Wrestlemania 2[Hulk Hogan: The Ultimate Anthology]Steel Cage Match: Hulk Hogan vs. Paul Orndorff - Orndorff attacked Hogan right away using the belt to whip him & kept going for quick escapes out of the cage only for Hogan to stop him even using the headband to choke.  Both men would continue to take hard hits including ramming each other in the cage at the same time before escaping at the same time causing the match to be restarted.  Orndorff still was able to dominate before Hogan made his comeback using the cage to his favor against Orndorff before Bobby Heenan got involved as well.  Their feud was intense & this final battle definitely showcased that point.\"Saturday Night's Main Event\" Jan. '87[Best Of Saturday Night's Main Event]Hulk Hogan vs. Andre The Giant - This was (and arguably still is) the biggest match in the history of professional wrestling as it headlined the 93,000+ indoor attendance record.  Hogan went for a slam in the opening moments leading to a controversial moment early in the match before Andre continued to beat on Hogan's back to the point where he literally just walked all over him.  Whatever momentum Hogan attempted to gain was constantly stopped by Andre causing Hogan to get desperate with a piledriver attempt on the concrete floor only for Andre to again overpower him.  The match was your stereotypical \"Hogan\" performance but this was more about the attraction of two giant names in the industry against each other on a huge state.Wrestlemania III[Hulk Still Rules; Hulk Hogan: The Ultimate Anthology; True Story Of WrestleMania]Hulk Hogan vs. Andre The Giant - It took close to a year but this was the rematch due to the controversial nature of the first match however this match was held under different circumstances as Ted Dibiase had hired Andre to win the title for him from Hogan.  Hogan went after Dibiase & his bodyguard Virgil before targeting Andre but couldn't knock him off his feet to the point where he got desperate & went out of his element that allowed Andre to gain the advantage before a move was so impactful that knocked one out of the ring & the other to the floor.  Hogan was able to regain control but still had to deal with outside factors in Dibiase & Virgil allowing Andre to once again take advantage where another factor became the deciding one.  Despite that this match was shorter than the Mania match, it was more competitive but will always be remembered for the controversial outcome.\"The Main Event\" Feb. '88[Best Of Saturday Night's Main Event]Randy Savage vs. Hulk Hogan - \"The Mega Powers Explode\" was the tagline for this match as Hogan & Savage were friends & tag partners for a year but due to the jealous of Savage over Hogan setup this match with their manager of Elizabeth remaining in a neutral corner as Savage kept going to the outside to break Hogan's momentum & went as far as to put Elizabeth in front of him when Hogan started to chase him on the outside.  Hogan went out of his comfort zone against Savage executing moves like a drop toehold into a headlock while Savage also did wrestling himself like countering the hold with a back suplex but also resort to his old tricks of pulling hair & eye poke along causing Hogan to play his game using dirty tactics of his own.  They traded momentum throughout the match with Hogan taking as much as he gave like press slamming Savage over the top to the floor while starting to bleed over his eye but Elizabeth kept getting in the way on the outside to the point where the referee had to make a call involving her before Savage would continue to bring the fight doing a top rope double axe handle onto the guardrail along with still taking shortcuts using the ropes & wrist tape to choke Hogan's throat.  This was one of the most competitive & aggressive matches during this era of Hogan's run as Savage was able to bring out more of Hogan on a grand stage than others have in the past.Wrestlemania V[Hulk Hogan: The Ultimate Anthology; Macho Madness: The Ultimate Randy Savage Collection]Hulk Hogan vs. Intercontinental Champion Ultimate Warrior - This was (at the time) the most unique World Title match in history as the two most popular wrestlers in the company fought each other in the main event with both the Intercontinental & World Title on the line.  Both men were pretty even early on as both had an advantage with the test of strength before going into a game of one upping the each as Warrior no sold Hogan's slam only for Hogan to take Warrior's & show the effects of it before hurting his knee going to the outside with Warrior capitalizing on it causing Hogan to resort to going to the eyes & Warrior getting dirty himself taking a shot at Hogan when the referee was trying to separate them.  Hogan continued to wrestle outside of his trademark offense go surprise the Warrior like going for an inside cradle & grounding Warrior with a reverse chinlock while Warrior used his power with holds like a bearhug with both men coming so close to a win to the point where each man had the other one beat at one point with the referee not being available to count the fall.  This was one of the best Ultimate Warrior matches in his lifetime as they just told a great story resulting in a classic even down the commentary where Monsoon & Ventura didn't have a \"good guy vs. bad guy\" guideline to follow as the fans being split right down the middle as well.Wrestlemania VI[Self Destruction Of Ultimate Warrior; Hulk Hogan: The Ultimate Anthology]Steel Cage Match: Bret Hart vs. Owen Hart - With the tension between Bret & Owen getting so heated along with the involvement  recently of Bret's former partner & the brother-in-law of both men in Jim \"The Anvil\" Niedhart, the steel cage match was made for not only the traditional use of keep both men inside the ring but also to keep the rest of the family out of it with the special added bonus of \"British Bulldog\" Davey Boy Smith in the audience which was the first time he was seen in WWE for almost 2 years.  Owen took the fight right to Bret by attacking him the moment he entered the cage while Bret was eventually able to recover & hit a bulldog out of the corner.  Both men were fighting & going as far as to dive for the cage door to escape various times but to no avail causing them to try climbing over the top with each man fighting the other to escape & taking hard hits like being slammed off the cage, just slipping off crotching the ropes, and both men at one point suplexing the other off the cage.  The cage was used as a weapon itself with Owen hit head first into it various times while Bret slid knee first into the cage reinjuring his knee as they both continued to wrestle hard in the ring such as their an exchange of sharpshooters.  Bret Hart commented on his match saying, \"We made people forget the a cage match is usually a bloody massacre\" which was true in this cage as it was still a very impactful & intense cage match for it's time with a ending that was truly down to the wire.Summerslam '94[Bloodbath: Wrestling's Most Dangerous Steel Cage Matches; Hart & Soul: The Hart Family Anthology]Iron Man Match: Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels - Just like they did the first Ladder Match, both men also did the very first Iron Man match in WWE history & for those who don't know the rules, the match has a 1 hour time limit & the man with the most decisions at the end of the time wins the match while it should be noted that Shawn created his own \"WrestleMania Moment\" before the match got started with his entrance. Shawn worked a different style than expected with him grounding Bret with various takedowns while Bret used the same strategy by keeping Shawn down with headlocks before Shawn moved into working over the arm with armbars & a hammerlock. Things started to pick up when Shawn caught Bret off guard with a head scissors that took him to the outside before attempting a Sweet Chin Music that missed Bret & knocked out someone else before returning to working over Bret's shoulder with various holds & even using the ringpost multiple times as Shawn kept trading his offensive style from the high flying with a crossbody onto Bret on the outside to grounded wrestling with the Perfect-Plex. Bret started to get more aggressive with his offense like the coming off the top rope with a knee into Shawn's head & started focusing on his back after the backdrop over the post onto the outside with moves like the backbreaker, back suplex from the top rope, and throwing Shawn into the corner so hard that he went over the top rope & his Jose on the outside. Both men started showing signs of the exhaustion as the match kept going as Bret beat on Shawn until he was out of breath before both men started pulling out all the stops like Bret's suicide dive onto the outside & Shawn executing separate moonsaults & head scissors off the top rope. The final moments were very intense while everything that also happened after we heard a bell was controversial in it's own right but it doesn't take away that these two men delivered a quality performance.Wrestlemania XII[From The Vault: Shawn Michaels; Greatest Rivalries: Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels]Shawn Michaels vs. Mankind - Paul Bearer pushed a casket with Mankind inside of it before the match & you got the tone of what this match was going to be within the first few minutes when both men took it to the floor with Shawn stomping on the outside mat with Mankind underneath it, delivering a flying crossbody to the outside & whipping his head back onto the concrete floor.  This match quickly evolved into a brawl with both men throwing fist & going back to the outside with Shawn targeting the leg after delivering a suplex that resulted in Mankind's leg slamming into the steps followed by driving the leg into the casket & various submissions.  Mankind fought back working over HBK in corner with two double axe handles in the Tree Of Woe but also took punishment as his knee once again ran into the steps, took a drop toe hold to the face, and his head wrapped between the ropes but still able to catch Shawn in the Mandible Claw which caused Shawn to focus on that hand as he attacked it using a chair multiple times & stomps.  Both men traded momentum from here with both taking the punishment together such as a superplex through the outside table & Mankind getting a superkick to the face with a chair on the top rope before various associates got involved.  Foley stated that this was the best match in his career in his first book, Shawn would later state that this was his favorite match during his first WWE Championship defense during the \"Boyhood Dream\" run, and various people claimed this to be the match of the year for 1996 as this was a standout encounter in both mens careers.In Your House: Mind Games '96[From The Vault: Shawn Michaels; Mick Foley: Hard Knocks & Cheap Pops; Mick Foley's Greatest Hits & Misses]Shawn Michaels vs. Steve Austin - Mike Tyson was the special outside enforcer for this match but already had his issues with Austin leading to him joining Shawn's group of D-Generation X weeks earlier while it should also be noted that Shawn Michaels came out to the DX band performing him to the ring while Shawn had been nursing a back injury that caused him to be out of action since the Royal Rumble in January. Shawn kept throwing jabs early causing Austin to retaliate with a clothesline & punches while making an ass out of Shawn. Triple H & Chyna got involved causing them to be sent to the back while Austin & HBK brawled from the ring to the stage to ringside with Austin backdropped over the railing at one point. Shawn remained in control working over Austin's legs while continued to taunt him. The big moment came with the referee being knocked out before Austin caught Sweet Chin Music into a stunner causing Tyson to get involved how nobody expected him to going into the match with Tyson delivering the final \"blow\" to Shawn Michaels.Wrestlemania XIV[Stone Cold Steve Austin: The Bottom Line]Street Fight Match: Triple H vs. Cactus Jack - Knowing how violent this match was going to be, Triple H sent Stephanie to the back before the match started & he was right in doing that as we saw both men target each others heads in the opening minutes with the steel steps & ring bell being used before a chair was brought into play with Cactus daring Triple H to use it before nailing him with it with Cactus later using the chair to give a legdrop onto Triple H.  The brawl went to the through the crowd & to the stage where Triple H was suplexed onto a wooden pallet that ended up stabbing him in the leg while also taking hits with the steps & a trash can but things really got intense when the barbed wire baseball bat came into play with Foley taking many shots with it to the back while Triple H was a victim of what Jim Ross called \"deadly birth control\" & heavily bleeding from the bat being driven into his face.  The fight once again went back to the outside with the result being the announce table completely covered in blood before Cactus was thrown into & eventually through the steel steps as Triple H was attempting to recreate history from a year earlier with handcuffs & chairs which didn't work out the way he expected as Cactus still fought back including another low blow & unexpected help for Cactus before the fight came back into the ring filled with thumbtacks.  Triple H once said that this was a hardcore war that took fans on a roller coaster of emotions but also told a story as everything used served a purpose & I couldn't agree more as this was the match that definitely put Triple H on the map as a long term main event player.Royal Rumble '00[Triple H: That Damn Good; Triple H: The Game; Mick Foley's Greatest Hits & Misses]The Rock vs. Triple H vs. Kurt Angle - Although this is a match from the WWE Championship, that was more of an afterthought in the minds of the challengers as Triple H came to the ring looking for revenge against Kurt Angle to kissing his wife Stephanie to the point where Triple H brawled with Kurt & ended up delivering a pedigree on the spanish table that gave away causing Kurt to land on his head knocking him out & had him taken to the back before The Rock even made his entrance to start the match. The Rock finally made his way to the ring brawling with Triple H back to the stage area (with Triple H continuing to beat on Angle despite being on a stretcher) before fighting back to the ring with Stephanie coming out (despite Triple H earlier telling her to stay backstage) only to accidentally hit her husband with the title belt. Triple H resorted to using the sledgehammer to gain an advantage by working over the midsection of The Rock while Stephanie was able to drag Kurt Angle back down to ringside to help Triple H only for Angle to break up his pin & throw Triple H into the steps. Angle went for revenge against Triple H by trying to use the sledgehammer himself but Stephanie stopped him only for Triple H to accidentally end up hitting Stephanie before Angle went ahead & used the hammer allowing Rock to take advantage of the entire situation. Triple H has gone on record saying how this is the most unusual match he's ever been in & quite frankly, I can't disagree as it was in reality The Rock vs. Triple H featuring Kurt Angle but was definitely entertaining.As a side note, the pedigree through the table on Kurt Angle was so impactful that WWE continued to show that clip for years during the commercials asking people to \"Please Don't Try This At Home.\"Summerslam '00[Triple H: That Damn Good; The Epic Journey Of Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson]No Disqualification Match: The Rock vs. Steve Austin - You could feel the tension between both men for weeks & it exploded right from the start when Austin attacked Rock during his entrance with both men blocking each others signature moves early with even Rock attempting Austin's own stunner. Both men brawled on the outside with Austin hit the Rock with the ringbell busting him open right away before they took it back into the ring with them trading momentum as Rock returned the favor to Austin with the ringbell causing him to bleed. Both men pulled out all stops using the ringpost & monitor while both attempted the moves like a sharpshooter, the \"Million $ Dream\" that we hadn't seen in years, and Rock delivering Austin's own stunner. However what this match is most memorable for happened when Vince McMahon appeared & his involvement showing how someone would \"sell their soul\" to become the champion. Jim Ross described this match best on commentary, \"Off The Page Intense!\"Wrestlemania X-7[Legacy Of Stone Cold Steve Austin; Stone Cold Steve Austin: The Bottom Line]Undisputed Championship Match: Steve Austin vs. Chris Jericho - This match was setup in that Steve Austin faced & defeated Kurt Angle in the WWE Championship right before Jericho's match with The Rock over the World Championship which was joined in progress where Jericho beat The Rock with help from Mr. McMahon. The match with Austin started right afterwords with Austin going right after Jericho before Angle & Rock got involved. Austin took the fight right to the floor with both men ending up hitting the exposed floor after failed attempts of a Stunner & Walls Of Jericho on the announce table. Jericho worked over Austin's arm & shoulder with submission moves like an armbar while stealing Austin's own stunner. Things got way out of control with appearance from Vince McMahon, Ric Flair, former WCW referee Nick Patrick, and Booker T before Chris Jericho walked away with two championships & history being made.Vengeance '01[Breaking The Code: Behind The Walls Of Chris Jericho]Undertaker vs. The Rock vs. Kurt Angle - Taker & Rock had their own personal issues going into this match causing them to focus on each other initially until Angle made it clear that he wasn't going to be ignored only for that to result in both of them double teaming Angle but Angle was able to recover & taking Taker out using the steps on the outside before focusing on Rock using various suplexes.  The action picked up between all 3 as each man would steal the others signature moves including the chokeslam. Rock Bottom, anklelock, and Angle slam before Angle & Taker faced off with each other that resulted in Angle bleeding & bring a chair into the match.  Everyone continued to fight hard pulling out all the stops including their own signature holds like the Angle Slam & sharpshooter while also being able to pull out counters like the Last Ride into a triangle choke & Rock Bottom into the anklelock with everyone kicking out of everyone else's finishing moves.  This was one of the best triple threat matches at that time as you saw high impact action between all three men along with various one on one singles encounters between each men.Vengeance '02[The Rock: Just Bring It - Collectors Edition; The Rock: The Most Electrifying Man In Sports Entertainment]The Rock vs. Brock Lesnar - This was one of the most intense buildups to a match that WWE did around this time based off the video packages & idea that both men didn't touch leading up to this match. Rock gave an idea of exactly where this match is going with Rock sprinting to the ring with Brock throwing across the ring with a belly to belly suplex. Brock continued to show his superior strength by clothesling Rock over the barrier & pressing him above the barrier before dropping Rock on it ribs first before Brock completely focused on his ribs with shoulderblocks & waistlock bearhugs. Rock had to resort to some dirty tactics & catching Brock off guard to get some offense in taking it to the outside & slingshotting Brock in the post before taking care of Paul Heyman. With both men continuing to counter & kick out of each others signature holds, this match delivered on what it was setup to be...a highly intense match.Summerslam '02[Brock Lesnar: Here Comes The Pain; The Epic Journey Of Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson]Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit - Only months earlier they were dysfunctional tag team champions to now facing each other for the championship & this was made even ground early with Kurt Angle's associates in Charlie Hass & Shelton Benjamin being thrown out of ringside before the match started.  Angle targeted Benoit's previously injured neck with various forearms while Benoit came very aggressive at Angle with a clothesline to the back of the head, chops, and a DDT on the apron that busted Angle's nose before countering Angle's own slam into a sharpshooter submission.  They resorted to wrestling as Angle continued to work over the neck with a rear chinlock & body scissors while Benoit used his trademark suplexes before Angle was able to make a comeback with his running top rope suplex.  Both men switched german suplexes against each other that ended with Benoit giving Angle one that turned him inside out before Benoit took high risk going for his flying headbutt that had him going 3/4 across the ring to hit the back of Angle's head while also doing an attempt at the crossface that was able to be rolled through into an anklelock.  Two of the best \"wrestlers\" in WWE gave you the classic wrestling encounter that would expect from them.Royal Rumble '03[Hard Knocks: The Chris Benoit Story]John Cena vs. Chris Jericho vs. Christian - Cena was the odd man out here with both men having their issues with him to the point where Christian & Jericho were fighting over who got to beat up Cena which ultimately had them turn on each other before Christian's problem solver in Tomko got involved followed by Cena getting his shot on Christian with an F.U. over the top to the outside.  Jericho gained the advantage & worked over Cena with various running low dropkicks before taking the fight to the outside where he took a DDT on the title belt allowing Christian to get his chance at Cena attempting to ground him.  A series of domino effects happened during the match of Christian attacking Jericho caused the referee to be temporarily taken out of the match, one pushed into the other on the apron allowing a pin attempt by the third man, one's powerbombing off the the top rope also allowed the other to be the victim of a top rope suplex, and a drop toe hold by one man allowed the other guy to get headbutted low.  This was a good triple threat match that saw various \"cause & effect\" situations along with everyone having close pin & submissions attempts broken up by the other.Vengeance '05Other matches include early title defenses (dating back to the World WIDE Wrestling Federation days of the 1970's) such as Bruno Sammartino vs. Killer Kowalski, Billy Graham vs. Bob Backlund, Bob Backlund vs. Greg Valentine, and Bob Backlund vs. Sgt. Slaughter while there are no DVD extras for this set.This DVD has it's pros & cons depending on how you want to look at it.  With the DVD being strictly about the WWE Championship, all you saw was the match itself meaning that such moments that happened after the match wasn't shown like the aftermath of the rematch Hogan/Andre match involving the referees or what happened after the Bret/Owen SummerSlam cage match with the Hart Family wasn't shown.  As I stated earlier, the matches were determined by a fan vote however that vote resulted in many matches on here being picked that were already released on various other DVD's which is positive for someone who isn't able to collect many DVD sets but a heavy negative for those who are regular collectors of DVD sets along with the fact that some matches that were more important to the history of the championship that were unreleased at that time (and some still to this day years later) weren't even on the poll for the vans to vote on such as how the controversial \"Montreal Screwjob\" is missing from a presentation about the WWE Championship when that's one of the most infamous matches in the title's history.  In the end, the matches themselves were quality in their own right with the only criticisms being on just the way this DVD was setup making this only recommend for those who haven't been heavy WWE DVD collectors & don't have many of these matches elsewhere."],["I am extremely disappointed in the way that the history of the WWE title was presented. The personalities of the 70's, 80's and 90's are so much different and would have made this more colorful if we had guys like Mean Gene, Jesse Ventura, Jerry Lawler etc speaking on this subject other than the 'ol Bore J.R. To me he is NOT the face of WWE nor does he present the matches that well. The segment changes are choppy too. Im 28 years old and have probably seen alot of these matches 10 or more times anyway, but I would have liked to have seen better timeline segements from each title change and the storylines that embodied them. To be honest this should have been a six disc set with full length matches as provided but GIVE us more to sink our teeth into! The HISTORY of the Championship os misleading. This is the showcasing of the most popular matches over the years with TOO MUCH MISSING IN BETWEEN! For example I think what made Shawn Michaels so great was his charisma and rivalries. What made Hogan great was his behind the curtain friendships (not real life friendships, but his storyline friendships) like Hacksaw, Tugboat, Macho Man, Warrior, and others that he stood up for along with USA. You don't get the personal touch on this, its  real cut and dry...and by DRY did I mention J.R. babbles between the matches? To me J.R. will always be that WCW southern bore. I loved Monsoons technical speak, Bobby Heenans wisecracks, Venturas brutal truth. To me McMahon and J.R. were the worst commentators, with the exception of J.R.'s \"STONE COLD!!! STONE COLD!! STONE COLD!!! Rent it, don't buy. This sucks!"],["Some great ones, but really, who doesn't already have most of these matches?Disc 1WWWF Championship MatchIvan Koloff vs. Pedro MoralesMadison Square Garden - 2/8/71WWWF Championship MatchBruno Sammartino vs. Killer KowalskiMadison Square Garden - 4/29/74WWWF Championship MatchBruno Sammartino vs. \"Superstar\" Billy GrahamBaltimore, Md -- 4/30/77WWWF Championship Match\"Superstar\" Billy Graham vs. Bob BacklundMadison Square Garden - 2/20/78WWE Championship MatchBob Backlund vs. Greg ValentinePhiladelphia, PA - 1/16/82WWE Championship MatchBob Backlund vs. Sgt.

Granted, there are a lot of matches on there that are on other DVDS, but it's the History Of The WWE Championship after all. Can you imagine the WWE not putting Hogan vs. Warrior on there? Or Michaels vs. Foley? Or Cactus Jack vs. Triple H? Or Hogan vs. Andre and so on just because they are on other DVDS? These seem like pretty historical matches to me and I feel that they belong on the DVD no matter what anybody says. Would you buy this DVD if it didn't have those matches on there? I know that I wouldn't have bought it if those matches were not included even though I have a HUGE wrestling video/DVD collection with just about every major WWE DVD title in it: From The Vault, Chris Benoit, both Hogan DVDS, Bret Hart, and both Undertaker DVDS just to name a few. Call me weird, but the duplicate matches issue that many complain about doesn't affect me when I buy DVDS.What many people probably forgot is the fact that half the choices were picked via the fans vote. There were many choices that were never before shown on any DVDS but fans failed to vote them onto the DVD. Who's fault is that? It's not WWE's thats for sure.Now, my challenge to you negative people is this. Take a look at the match listing. Study it real carefully then take out a pen and paper. One by one subtract all duplicate matches but keep the new selections. Write down the matches you would have wanted to see in addition to the matches that were released for the first time. Compare your list with the original match listing and see if your list is better then their list."],["I liked the DVD set to be honest. It however did remind me of the History of the Undertaker 3 disc set. The whole thing comes off as a way for WWE to make a buck(which that is the whole point in selling merchandise in the first place) than something special. JR hosts and introduces the matches but he seems so stiff doing it. On the other hand, I enjoyed the match selection, especially on disk 2 & 3. Some of tehse matches I had already seen or didn't care that much to watch anyway, but I was glad to see them. I would say this is a great set for new WWE fans. Atleast discs 2 & 3 are. Soem may get bored wi th the matches from the 70's and 80's.In the end, I could only get one dvd at teh moment, and I am glad I picked this one."],["[...]Ladies and Gentlemen, I am not going to lie. I have had this DVD for while now, pretty much since it came out a few years ago. I just watched it for the first time recently. The WWE title has been around for over 40 years. This DVD includes matches voted on by us the fans. Well its 3-discs and features all the greats Bruno Sammartino, Hulk Hogan, Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, Undertaker, Triple H, John Cena, Bret Hart, Shawn Michaels, Eddie Guerrero, Kurt Angle, and more! Here's the disc by disc breakdown.Disc 1:Covers from when the title was first made to the end of the 80's. Disc 1 has about 12 matches on it. Some of the early matches aren't show with the greatest quality footage but what do you expect for footage that is almost 40 years old? Some of the matches include Bruno Sammartino vs. Killer Kowalski, Hulk Hogan vs. Andre the Giant (Wrestlemania 3) and \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage vs. Hulk Hogan (Wrestlemania 5) and that's just a sample. One of the best things included on Disc 1 is they have a thing called the time line, and it included the closing moments from pretty much every title change up to 2006. The earlier years are just text because as I said, the footage wasn't the greatest.Disc 2:Covers the 1990's, this disc only has 5 or 6 matches on it. The reason is it includes the entire HBK vs Bret Hart 60-min Iron Man match from Wrestlemania 12. It also includes Hogan/Warrior from Wrestlemania 6. So, even though it only has 5 matche,s the Iron Man match is worth it.Disc 3:Covers from 2000-2006, it has some good matches on it like Street Fight HHH vs. Cactus Jack from Royal Rumble 2000, Rock/Austin from Wrestlemania 17, Undisputed Championship Match Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Chris Jericho, The Rock vs Brock Lesnar from Summerslam, and others. To me this is the weak disc of the set. Don't get me wrong it is still a good disc just not as good as the others.Overall its a pretty good set but a lot of the matches except for some of the stuff on Disc 1 has been on countless other best of sets and I would have like to seen some matches not yet released or only released a few times. Some of the matches I wished were on it are The Rock vs Mick Foley I Quit match, and their empty arena match they had and The Montreal Screw Job, and others. The one match I am shocked that was not included in the set was the match from Raw where Foley first wins the title just because of the whole thing with WCW bashing it and causing millions of people to switch over to Raw to see it. So, if you can get this set cheap, go ahead it is a great set. 4 out of 5."],["This should be one of the best dvd collections that wwe has ever did.  Whats good about this is that the wwe fans are the ones that selected each match.  So if people are sick about the same old matches being put out, than you can blame every fan that voted on them.  Other than that, seeing alot of the classic matches from the 70's to the great ones of today.  This dvd set should be in every wrestling fans collection."],["This is a really good colection with great matches but my only complaint is that most of the matches can be seen on  dvd sets already. I mean most of the Hogan matches can be seen on his set. So how about matches that can be seen on there sets plus more rare matches that people may have actually forgot about ?These are the matches included:Disc 1WWWF Championship MatchIvan Koloff vs. Pedro MoralesMadison Square Garden - 2/8/71WWWF Championship MatchBruno Sammartino vs. Killer KowalskiMadison Square Garden - 4/29/74WWWF Championship MatchBruno Sammartino vs. \"Superstar\" Billy GrahamBaltimore, Md -- 4/30/77WWWF Championship Match\"Superstar\" Billy Graham vs. Bob BacklundMadison Square Garden - 2/20/78WWE Championship MatchBob Backlund vs. Greg ValentinePhiladelphia, PA - 1/16/82WWE Championship MatchBob Backlund vs. Sgt. SlaughterMadison Square GardenWWE Championship MatchIron Sheik vs. Hulk HoganMadison Square Garden: Hogan pretty much dominates this one but it's still a classic and shows the start of Hulkamania. 8/10Steel Cage Match For The WWE ChampionshipHulk Hogan vs. King Kong BundyWrestlemania 2: I saw this match way too many times and was never that impressed by it. I would take away this match and add Bret vs Flair on Raw which the WWE always leaves. They left it out on the Bret dvd and left it out here too. Anyway Hogan wins here the usual Hogan way, big boot and leg drop and then exiting the cage. 6/10Steel Cage Match For The WWE ChampionshipHulk Hogan vs. \"Mr. Wonderful\" Paul OrndorffSaturday Night's Main Event: Now this Hogan cage match is way more impressive than the Bundy one since Hogan is in the ring with the capable and under-rated Paul Orndorff. Hogan wins of course but it's probably still his best match on here next to his Savage match and Warrior match. 8/10WWE Championship MatchHulk Hogan vs. Andre The GiantWrestlemania III: This match is mostly just about..can Hogan lift Andre or can Hogan beat Andre. Both questions get answered of course. Hogan slams Andre and leg drops him for the historic win. This was probably as big of a match as the Bret/HBK Iron Man match. Is it as impressive wrestling wise ? No, not at all but it's still a classic big match. 7/10WWE Championship MatchHulk Hogan vs. Andre The GiantThe Main Event: I'm surprised this one is included because it's more rare than all the other usual matches that the WWE already have had on dvd before. I mean most the matches on this set we have seen on other sets... Anyway in this rare match Hogan gets screwed over by the Hebner twins when he has his shoulder up but gets counted to 3 anyway. 6/10WWE Championship MatchRandy \"Macho Man\" Savage vs. Hulk HoganWrestlemania V: I'm not sure if Hogan ever let Savage beat him. I mean in WCW Savage's last 2 reighns were both stolen by Hogan without Savage getting a chance to even enjoy them. He won one title from Sting and lost it to Hogan the next night and won one belt from Nash and lost that one the following night to Hogan too. Plus this first title reighn, I don't even think Savage got to defend it the whole year he had it. I just remember him teaming up with Hogan that whole year and being kept in his shadow eventhough he was champ. Anyway this is a classiv mainevent and no doubt their match ever since they were in their prime. Hogan hulks up for win after the elbow drop by Savage of course. 8/10. If Savage ever got to have a successful defense in this reighn I would've liked to have seen it on this dvd.Disc 2WWE Championship MatchHulk Hogan vs. Ultimate WarriorWrestlemania VI: This match was so good that when they tried to redo it years later it just sucked. It lacked the drama, emotion and excitement that this match had. Warrior wins after a splash on Hogan that Hogan basically no sells. Still though there has been no bigger face vs face match than Hogam vs the Warrior. 8/10Steel Cage Match For The WWE ChampionshipBret Hart vs. Owen HartSummerslam: I wish the dvd didn't literly skpt like 6 reighns and few big matches to go all the way from 1990 to like 1994. This is a great match but it is on the WWE cage match dvd. I would've liked to have seen this on the dvd plus matches that a more rare. Still though this is a great title match and showed that Owen probably would've made it to a World title reighn if he didn't die tragically. This is probably the best cage match on the dvd next to Hogan vs Mr. Wonderful. 9/10Iron Man Match For The WWE ChampionshipBret Hart vs. Shawn MichaelsWrestlemania Xii: This one needs no introduction but it's on so many different WWE dvds as it is. It would've been a sin if it wasn't on the dvd but I am still waiting for their first match where Bret beat Shawn successfully at an earlier Suvivor Series. 10/10WWE Championship MatchShawn Michaels vs. MankindIn Your House: Mind Games: This one has a lot of bumps and great action but no one wins! Plus it has already been on every HBK dvd that has been released.

It was three discs and only $20, so I figured it was worth the cash.I brought it home and I was dismayed to find that I already had most of the matches on DVD.  In some cases I have the same match on three seperate discs!  Talk about a disappointment.On the plus side, the WWE is finally paying Jesse Ventura to use his commentary and Bret Hart vs. Owen Hart from Summerslam '94 is finally on disc.  Orher than that though, I can't justify purchasing this dvd, even if it is for $20.If you don't have any other WWE dvds, then this is a worthwhile purchase, but I still think you'd be better off buying something from a tape trader."],["I have been a wrestling fan since 1996 and have watched all kinds of wrestling. I have a wrestling DVD/VHS collection spanning over 50 all together. This is the most complete and accurate review of this DVD you will find. I hope you find this review helpful; remember to vote helpful or not helpful. (Note-Each DVD I review has a \"Match of the DVD\" award somewhere in it.)The History of the WWE ChampionshipIf you ever read that bit of information at the top of all my wrestling reviews, you'll learn that I started watching wrestling in 1996. I am not a fan of old school wrestling. Most wrestling from the 70's, I can't even stand. If you were a fan of it, you might want to honestly disregard a lot of my matches on first disk.With that being said, this is a good compilation of some of the most memorable WWE Championship matches. The fans voted on which matches they wanted on this DVD set, so I cannot blame WWE for what I got. I can only blame the fans. Regardless, you got a lot of matches that were worth watching and great. However, if you are a modern fan, disk one may entice vomiting.-Disc 1- (1970s-1980s)WWWF Championship (2/8/71)Ivan Koloff(c) VS Pedro MoralesThis match basically consists of the near 300 pound Ivan Koloff running away from Pedro.  Ivan uses a bunch of heel tactics to get the advantage, which is nice to see. You also get a cool ending. Still, the match is extremely slow and drags on. Also, the quality of the video is very poor and even screws up at times.RATING- 4/10WWWF Championship (4/29/71)Bruno Sammartino(c) VS Killer KolwaskiThis is another match that seems to drag on forever with really little substance. Any modern fan is going to have trouble even staying awake while that do the same moves over and over again. This is all added to the fact that the match is joined in progress, so you miss some of the match anyway.RATING- 3/10WWWF Championship (4/30/77)Bruno Sammartino(c) VS \"Superstar\" Billy GrahamHere we go again. This is yet another boring match. The quality of the video is really bad too. You do get to see Graham get his title victory by cheating. Also, there are a few good power displays.RATING- 4/10WWWF Championship (2/20/78)\"Superstar\" Billy Graham(c) VS Bob BacklundThis match is clipped and you only see the ending where Bob Backlund beats Graham with an Atomic Drop.RATING- No RatingSteel Cage Match (1/16/82)WWF ChampionshipBob Backlund(c) VS Greg \"The Hammer\" ValentineThis is another match that is clipped up. You see about 3 minutes or so of the match. What you see is good, I wish they wouldn't have clipped it up.RATING- No RatingWWF Championship (5/23/83)Bob Backlund(c) VS Sgt. SlaughterOkay, we have finally reached a good match on this set. This is a brawl. It's still really slow and drags a bit, but it does achieve a wild brawl though. This match has plenty of great wrestling for even modern fans.RATING- 7.5/10WWF Championship (1/23/84)Iron Sheik(c) VS Hulk HoganThis is the day that Hulkamania was born. Hulk Hogan wins the belt quickly, but not before exciting the fans and putting on a great show.RATING- 7/10Steel Cage Match (Wrestlemania II)WWF ChampionshipHulk Hogan(c) VS King Kong BundyBundy and Hogan put on a decent Cage Match here. One thing that really brings down this match is how Hogan no sold Kong's Avalanche. The Avalanche was the same move that put Hogan out of action for a while before that. Typical Hogan match.RATING- 6/10Steel Cage Match (1/3/82, Saturday Night's Main Event)WWF ChampionshipHulk Hogan(c) VS Paul OrndorffThis match was better than the last match, but still not great. Orndorff does get some good offence on Hogan. There is a good part in the match where both guys hit the floor first, and they restart the match.RATING- 7/10WWF Championship (Wrestlemania III)Hulk Hogan(c) VS Andre The GiantYou knew it had to be on here somewhere. This match is probably considered the biggest WWE Championship match in history. Andre works over Hogan's back after Hogan hurt it trying to lift Andre. The match is fairly average, but the emotion and ending bring this one up.RATING- 7/10WWF Championship (2/5/88, The Main Event)Hulk Hogan(c) VS Andre The GiantThis match is often forgotten about because it's the one that Hogan lost to Andre. Not only that, but there is a huge screw job ending. Hogan kicks out at one, but the referee just keeps counting to three. You get the same type of action as you saw in their previous match.RATING- 7/10WWF Championship (Wrestlemania V)Randy Savage(c) VS Hulk HoganThe story here is a love story. Miss Elizabeth doesn't know who she loves more, Hogan or Savage. I personally hate this story. The entire match is pretty boring and not worth a watch. Hogan wins in typical fashion.RATING- 5.5/10-Disc 2- (1990s)WWF Championship/Intercontinental Championship (Wrestlemania VI)Hulk Hogan(c) VS The Ultimate Warrior(c)This DVD just took an amazing turn for awesomeness. Hogan defends the WWF Championship against Warrior, who is defending his Intercontinental Championship against Hogan. There are a lot of power struggles. There are a few too many rest holds though and Hogan's fake knee injury only hurt the match.RATING- 9/10Steel Cage Match (Summerslam 1994)WWF ChampionshipBret Hart(c) VS Owen HartBrother VS Brother in a Steel Cage. It doesn't get much more personal than this. Both men are trying so hard to say they beat the other man. They are diving for the cage door just to try and get out. This is one of the better cage matches in history.RATING- 8.5/10Iron Man Match (Wrestlemania 12)WWF ChampionshipBret Hart(c) VS Shawn MichaelsIn my personal opinion, this match is very overrated. It is an extremely well played out match, but that doesn't mean it's not boring in spots. Also, if you know who wins already, most of the emotion of the match is gone. If you don't know who wins, stop reading reviews so you don't find out.RATING- 9/10WWF Championship (In Your House- Mind Games)Shawn Michaels(c) VS MankindI'm sorry but this match is nowhere near as good as what other people say. It is still a very solid match; it just lacks something to make it special. Still, this has some good wrestling and a few nice spots.RATING- 8/10WWF Championship (Wrestlemania XIV)Shawn Michaels(c) vs. Stone Cold Steve AustinThe Stone Cold Era begins right here. These two battle all over the arena. The story is about Mike Tyson though. People are trying to figure out whose side he is on. Michaels is wrestling with a broken back.RATING- 8.5/10-Disk 3- (2000s)Street Fight (Royal Rumble 2000)WWF ChampionshipTriple H(c) VS Cactus JackI personally have always enjoyed their Hell in a Cell match atWWE No Way Out 2000more, but this is still a great match. Many weapons are used including thousands of thumbtacks. The Rock makes an appearance as well. Fantastic ending to this match.RATING- 9/10WWF Championship (Summerslam 2000)The Rock(c) VS Triple H VS Kurt AngleI'm not sure why this match is even on here since the entire thing is a mistake. Triple H attacks Angle before the match starts and Pedigrees him through a table. Angle is injured from this and is out the majority of the match. From that point, The Rock and Triple H are on damage control. They seem lost and don't seem to tell any story in the ring. The match only picks up when Angle returns near the end of the match.RATING- 5.5/10No DisqualificationsWWF Championship (Wrestlemania X7)The Rock(c) VS Stone Cold Steve AustinThis is considered by many to be the grand finale to the Attitude Era. These two put on an amazing show with plenty of weapons and brawling. There is a weird moment where both contestants seem a bit lost, but they quickly get back into the match. There is a great twist at the end of the match.RATING- 9.5/10Undisputed Championship (Vengeance 2001)Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Chris JerichoAustin had just beaten Kurt Angle to retain his WWF Championship. Jericho had just won the WCW Title from The Rock. These two men were now going to fight to decide one champion. The match is really short and nothing of interest really happens. This is on here for the historical value.RATING- 5/10Undisputed Championship (Vengeance 2002)Rock VS Undertaker(c) VS Kurt AngleThis is one of the coolest Triple Threat matches you'll ever watch. There are finishers galore in this match up. The wrestlers even use each others finishing moves multiple times throughout the match.RATING- 8.5/10Undisputed Championship (Summerslam 2002)The Rock(c) VS Brock LesnarThe Rock rockets to the ring to start the match. Each man gets an equal amount of offence in the match. The crowd is going insane for both Lesnar and The Rock. Heyman gets Rock Bottomed through the announce table. Brock Lesnar even uses the Rock Bottom. I thought the ending was too anticlimactic and the match was too short.RATING- 8/10WWE Championship (Royal Rumble 2003) (Match of the DVD)Kurt Angle(c) VS Chris BenoitThey topped it. The match starts off at a mellow pace but builds quickly. Angle takes a DDT on the apron and busts his nose. Once the match picks up these guys are going counter for counter. In the end Benoit loses to the Angle Lock, but he proved he can be Champion.RATING- 10/10WWE Championship (Vengeance 2005)John Cena(c) VS Christian VS Chris JerichoThis was a good way for this DVD set to close. John Cena is WWE's new poster boy, and he can put on good matches from time to time. Everyone gets a chance to shine in this match. Many Christian fans go insane after Christian appears to get a three count after a reverse DDT. This is a very strong match.RATING- 8.5/10"],["Great DVD with a lot of classic matches.  Let's get to it:Ivan Koloff vs. Pedro Morales (2/8/71)--This is a hard match to watch due to the quality of the tape.  The WWE did do a good job of cleaning it up though.  Good match with a near riot when Koloff won the title.  I give this match two stars!Bruno Sammartino vs. Killer Kowalski (4/29/74)--Was never a fan of either of these two.  Standard match.  I give this match one star!Bruno Sammartino vs. Superstar Billy Graham (4/30/77)--Pretty good match but very slow.  I give this match two stars!Superstar Graham vs. Bob Backlund (2/20/78)--I hate this match because you only get to see the last 5 minutes maybe.  I think the whole match should have been shown, Bob was that good.  I give this match a half star!Bob Backlund vs. Greg Valentine (1/16/82)--Again, just clips of this match is shown.  Why couldn't they show the whole match?  I think Bob Backlund is one of the greatest champions ever and should have had these matches shown complete.Bob Backlund vs. Sgt Slaughter (5/23/83)--This match is complete and is pretty good.  It is a very physical match from Backlund which is suprising due to his outstanding wrestling ability.  I give this match one and a half stars!Hulk Hogan vs. Iron Shiek (1/23/84)--Pretty short match, almost a squash match.  This was the start of Hulkamania with this one title win.  Good match.  I give this match two stars!Hulk Hogan vs. King Kong Bundy (4/5/86)--This match was at Wrestlemania 2 in a cage and for some reason I love this match.  It did introduce the big blue cage but it was fun to watch.  I give this match three stars!Hulk Hogan vs. Paul Orndorff (1/3/87)--This is the cage match from Saturday Night's Main Event and it was a good match. I give this match two stars!Hulk Hogan vs. Andre the Giant(3/29/87)--One of the most infamous matches in the world that featured the \"slam heard round the world\" in front of over 93,000 fans.  This match was good but was overshadowed by the Steamboat/Savage match.  Still well worth seeing.  I give this match two and a half stars!Hulk Hogan vs. Andre the Giant (2/5/88)--This was front the Main Event and featured the infamous doublecross with the twin referees and Andre stealing the belt from Hogan and selling it to the Million Dollar Man.  Classic storyline!  I give this match two stars!Hulk Hogan vs.  Randy Savage (4/2/89)--This is probably their best match together and to me the first real main event of Wrestlemania.  This is poetry in motion with not a single flaw.  I give this match four stars!Hulk Hogan vs. Ultimate Warrior (4/1/90)--This is a classic between the two \"goody two shoes\" going at it.  This is probably the Warrior's greatest match and greatest moment from his career.  This was Hogan's finest moment as well being able to bring that kind of match out of the Warrior.  I give this match four stars!Bret Hart vs. Owen Hart (8/29/94)--This is their cage match from Summerslam with their family at ringside.  This, to me, is the greatest cage match of all time.  I loved this match.  I know the match is around 33:00 long and i once did a count of escape attempts of the cage and there was like 38 of them, so if you break that down that's an escpae attempt ever minute of the match with 5 of them left over!!  I give this match four stars!Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels (3/31/96)--The infamous Iron Man match from Wrestlemania 12 that delivered.  This was a great match from start to finish and even the overtime was very well done.  I really at the time of this match don't think that there were two other guys in the WWE who could have pulled this match off like these two did.  Very well done.  I give this match four stars!Shawn Michaels vs. Mankind (9/22/96)--Awesome match!  I still think this is one of the best title matches the WWE ever had.  The only thing that ruined it was a DQ ending instead of a clear cut winner by either pinfall or submission.  Otherwise, very well done match.  I give this match four stars!Shawn Michaels vs. Steve Austin (3/29/98)--This is the match we all thought was Shawn's last as his back was put to the test and it took 4 years off his career.  Still, this was a good match and the beginning of the Austin era in the WWE.  I give this match three stars!Triple H vs. Cactus Jack (1/23/2000)--This was the street fight from the Rumble and I still consider it to be the best one I have seen.  This match had everything from blood, boards wrapped in barbed wire, announce tables breaking, chairs being broken over people and yes thumbtacks!  This is a classic.  I give this match four stars!Rock vs. Triple H vs. Kurt Angle (8/27/2000)--Good match but really a one on one encounter as Angle was hurt after about 2 minutes into the match.  Still this was ok.  I give this match two stars!Rock vs. Steve Austin (4/1/01)--Great match!  This was the second time they would wrestle at Wrestlemania and this one was maybe the best with a lot of blood, counterholds and false finishes this one is a classic.  The only problem I have with this match is the ending with Austing and McMahon working together.  It came from out of nowhere and left everyone confused.  I give this match four stars!Steve Austin vs. Chris Jericho (12/9/01)--This was the match to unify the WCW and WWE world titles.  I hate this match because of all the people in all the world to make unified champion they choose Jericho.  I like Jericho but if I'm McMahon and i have a choice of Jericho or Austin I'm picking Austin to carry the company.  I give this match three stars!Rock vs. Undertaker vs. Kurt Angle (7/21/02)--Great Triple Threat match, maybe the best one done in the WWE.  I give this match four stars!Rock vs. Brock Lesnar (8/25/02)--Really good match.  I was never really a Rock fan when he wrestled so this match was really good to me because Lesnar just put him threw the wringer.  I give this match four stars!Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit (1/19/03)--Great match!  To me Angle and Benoit in the ring was like Flair and Steamboat.  They were awesome and their matches never sucked.  This match was maybe their best one that they ever had.  I give this match four stars!John Cena vs. Chris Jericho vs. Christian (6/26/05)--Didn't like the match.  John Cena to me is not a world champion and is the whole reason why I stopped watching wrestling.  He's nothing but a joke.  I give this match one star!Another great DVD set.  I would have liked to have seen more of Bob Backlund and more of Bret Hart but other than that this is still a great DVD and a good buy."],["Its a treasure believe me ,i have many DVDs and this one stand as the best one I've bought (like the Bret Hart DVD).It has tons of great matches and its a must have for new wrestling fans to learn what the business was and how it evolved .For old school fans you will LOVE the first DVD because its great and for Hogan fans this DVD has the best matches of Hogan in WWF. The time line alone deserve the price because it contains every title change that ever happened in a quick time line(with 2 or 3 exceptions because it was too old and not filmed)SO buy it and you will not regret it,but please be aware that after watching the dvds you will hate the wrestling world and how it transfered from the greatest matches between legends to jokes like Cena and Umaga."],["I have watched this DVD over and over again i love wwe tapes and this one was one of the best."],["I was waiting for this DVD since the voting began to decide the matches on wwe.com and I was so excited when it was finally released.

At first this is fun to watch and the matches are good but you lose interest in them fast because of the very slow old school style. The matches they chose also are not some of the greatest choices either (Backlund vs Slaughter for example is not as good as it sounds). And of course there is Hogan all over this DVD, even tho he has had two separate DVDs already. Disc 2 finally has Hart vs HBK in their ironman match and that is superb. Disc 3 is not bad but again, alot of the matches are still so new and easily available for purchase separately. Many people complain about the matches they want not being chosen and I would do that too but no one will ever agree. But there is a general concession of what should not be on this DVD set and why it was left in is a mystery.Nonetheless, this DVD is worth buying mostly for the history of the first disc and the ironman match on disc 2. If you are a hardcore wwe and wrestling fan, get this. If not, pass on it and wait till it goes down in price."],["Good DVD.  Left out Macho Man Randy Savage and the Ultimate Warrior to name a few.  Would have been better if it would have had all of the meaningful title reigns rather than hand picking just the WWE favorite sons."],["A good DVD set, although I've already noticed a few big things missing:* Survivor Series '94 - Bret Hart (w/British Bulldog) vs Bob Backlund (w/Owen Hart) - This was the towel match which saw the Bulldog knocked out and unable to throw the towel.  Great psychology & story - - why was it not on the DVD?* Hulk Hogan vs. Andre the Giant in The Main Event - - the match was on the DVD, but they TOTALLY eliminated EVERYTHING post match.  They cut the match when Andre surrenders the title.  NOTHING about the double refs, etc.  Cut out the best part of the story for that match as the match itself was short and really a throwaway."],["First, I want to thank the WWE for FINALLY letting Jim Ross host a DVD, especially one as important as this one. Jim Ross hosts this 3 disc retrospective look at the history of the WWE title. Most of the important moments are covered as Ross provides facts and information regarding the title's history inbetween select matches.Before I get into the matches and the production, I want to comment on the DVD package. This DVD set is packaged in a high quality digipak that resembles a book. It also includes a foldout insert showing a detailed timeline of all the WWE champions, with info on their title wins. When you unfold this insert, you'll notice how few people have actually held the WWE title, it's a prestigous honor indeed.Now, for the DVD matches themselves. Many have complained that too many of these matches have already been released a million times on DVD. This is true, however, there are some that are making their DVD debut, thus making the set worth picking up. Now, my only complaint is that I would have left off the Shawn Michaels vs Bret Hart Iron Man Match from WM XII, Shawn Michaels vs. Mankind from Mindgames INYH and the Rock vs. Triple H vs. Kurt Angle from SummerSlam 2000 and would have replaced them with Bret Hart vs. Ric Flair (Bret's first WWE Title win), the Rock's first WWE title win against Mankind in the Survivor Series tournament finals and the Iron Man Match between Kurt Angle and Brock Lesnar. All 3 of these matches would be making their DVD debuts, and in my opinion, really would've sparked interest in this set. For example, many (not just myself) feel that the Iron Man Match between Kurt Angle and Brock Lesnar from Smackdown! was perhaps the best match that both men had in the WWE.Other than that, it's hard to argue with the match selection that was chosen. Also, on disc one, there is a timeline video that shows every title change...ever. Each clip ranges from 3 to 10 seconds, but it's really cool to sit back and see how the title and the WWE changed over time. Plus, it's fun to try and remember each event and the circumstances behind each title change.If you don't have these matches on other DVD sets, than this is a must buy. The presentation and detailed information from Jim Ross is priceless. Also, if you were wondering, they did NOT cut Jesse Ventura's audio from the matches he called, THANK GOD! The WWF attitude era logo is still blurred, but that will ALWAYS be the case from now on, after the WWE's legal loss to the World Wildlife Fund.After seeing this, I really hope that we'll see a set, hosted by Jim Ross, devoted to the History of the World Title. Now, that warrants a 6 disc box set, due to that title's long and rich history! Flair vs. Sting, Flair vs. Rick Rude... the list goes on."],["Basically just another rehash of too many matches that have been released recently on DVD.  A few of the older matches haven't been released, but this release is a shining example of why I have a netflix account.

I have a major issue with the collection of matches they chose. As many others have stated, most of these matches are already available on other sets or even older tapes, and it would have been nice if there were classic matches that were previously unavailable on a commercially licensed DVD. I know that WWE has the footage, they own close to 100,000 hours of footage. A lot of the matches they chose were not classic matches by any means, many were GOOD, but not GREAT. And while the Hogan-Orndorff cage match is presented in its entirety for the first time, there are too many Hulk Hogan matches, which takes away from the set, especially when you take into account that Ric Flair, Eddie Guerrero and Kevin Nash (who held the title for a full year) are not profiled. Also, there are no matches from the Undertaker's title runs in the 1990s.Even with Jim Ross providing great insight and background information to viewers, it is still not enough. In all, there are way too many classic matches not shown here for this to be considered an essential purchase."],["I enjoyed watching some bout from when they took place, but several have been released on many other sets. Hopefully they bring out a second volume."],["There is a coliseum video about the World Heavyweight title. The tape ends when hogan was champ on his first reign. That tape is great. Gorilla Moonsoon with the commentary. The JR commentary doesn't make this garbage any better. The matches are like De ja vu let me think yes I have seen these before. Because these matches are on each and every other dvd. The extras on the dvd show the split seconds each title change. I really mean each clip has to be about 5 or 6 seconds. I know these matches were supposedly decided by the fans. I know I voted. Were the votes counted in Florida ? There are a million other matches that could have been on this dvd.  I got the first disc from Netflix because I was not going to buy it. Some may say \"He is crazy it was great\". Maybe for you it is. I have seen all of that before. I wanted this dvd to learn something new about that history. There are no perspective segments or interviews. Just overrated JR running his yap over matches he never called. I want to hear the real commentary with Jesse not JR. But WWE screwed that up. There are a lot of things just wrong about wrestling now...oh I mean Entertainment. It's garbage now. WWE has put out some good dvds its just they did a crappy job on this one. Hitman, Jake Roberts, Road Warriors, Monday Night etc etc. The dvds about the old days are the only things I look forward to because their current product is garbage. So when the thing I look forward to is as luckluster as this dvd sorry if I get a little ticked off.

I have always felt that Joe Public doesnt care what you or I have to say about a DVD, especially one that has yet to be released. By my own admission, I shouldnt have read the reviews, but I did.  The debate over the match listing has caused me to weigh in...I would assume that, like all WWE films, the documentary is the focus, and the matches are intended to be suplimental. Fine. Im looking forward to seeing the documentary, but I agree that the matches are sub-par in terms of the scope of this DVD. The thing is called, \"The History of the WWE Championship.\"  To me, that means you show every title change.  Obviously, if doesnt mean the same to them, or they wouldnt skip years at a time and, in turn, show matches where a title did not change hands.  By that logic, the upcoming Hogan set (which may even be 4 discs) could be considered the \"history\" of the championship.I understand that fans got to vote on matches.  However, I refuse to believe that the WWE had NO say. You dont run a business like that.When all is said and done, Im sure that it will be good. I also believe that it will be unsatisfying to those who really wanted a visual history of the championship, as advertised.  To be honest, I would much rather them put out a 10 disc set that sells for $100 or better.

There are effeminate men, drag queens, leather men and the obligatory sexual references. Guys and Balls certainly isn't going to light the world of German cinema on fire any time soon, but those who like their films good natured and fun will probably get a \"kick\" out of it.The lovable and nave Ecki (Maximilian Bruckner) is a baker's son from small-town Boldrup and has loved soccer since he was a child. Now in his early twenties, he plays goalie on a local team with his longtime rival, Udo (Carlo Ljubek), and is pursued by the gorgeous Cordula (Judith Hoersch), who's had a crush on him since they were kids.One night after a game at the local watering hole, Ecki is suddenly caught kissing another teammate. Appalled, the men rail into him, cussing him out with vitriolic homophobic remarks. Thrown off the team, Ecki packs his bags - but not before threatening to return with an all-gay team and to beat his former friends in a match. Travelling to Dortmund, Ecki enlists the help of his sister Susanne (Lisa Maria Potthoff) to create his new team and together they troll the city's various bars and leather clubs.The pack of rag-tag players is indeed a bunch of clich&eacute;s. There's the closeted Jurgen (Andreas Schmidt), swishy falafel maker Ercin (Billey Demirtas), who loves soccer players - especially the dreamy David Beckham, three motorcycle-riding leather daddies (Markus John, Charly Hubner, Christian Berkel) and Sven (David Rott), the sexiest nurse on Susanne's ward, whom Ecki develops a crush on.The boys eventually get it on together while Ecki copes with the trials of having a homophobic father - his dead even takes him to a brothel in the hopes the girls can convert him. There are also lots of soccer and numerous bawdy jokes back and forth about gays and masculinity - we're heard it all before. But if you can see past the clich&eacute;d oddball humour there are some moments of genuine emotion as Ecki and his mates train up for the big game.Of course the outcome is utterly predictable, but director Sherry Hormann and screenwriter Benedikt Gollhardt treat their gutsy and courageous band of odd men out with such fondness and warmth that it's hard not to root for their right to play their game against the homophobic and mean-spirited straight boys. Mike Leonard September 06."],["This is one of the better movies of this type ... it's a coming out story with likeable characters and pretty good production values."],["The acting was very good for the main cast and the movie while predictable was very enjoyable to watch.  I would buy this on DVD. Some of the scenes were actually laugh out loud funny!"],["This movie shows the underdog beating his own soccer team, and the demons he has inside about being gay."],["My partner and I had a good time watching this.  It had some definite laugh-out loud moments and having the opportunity to watch any form of homophobic redemption is good for the soul. Worth a Netflix rental."],["Great movie! A good story, well written, funny.The only complaint I have (and I have is the same complaint about the DVD of \"Regular Guys\") is that the subtitles are on the film master ans cannot be turned off.Other than that, I highly recomend this film."],["I love futball and this German video is perfect for the athlete who is worried about coming out and finding out that you are not alone.  Especially in the sports world."],["Director Sherry Horman and writer Benedikt Gollhardt have not introduced any new ideas in 'M&auml;nner wie wir' ('Guys and Balls') - team sports dependent on camaraderie, outsiders getting the last laugh, coming out stories with sports as a background, homophobia to the max, and stereotypical depictions of gay men - but they have created a movie that has enough charm to get past all of the above.  It is that kind of movie that makes you groan 'Oh no, not again', but then ends up making you feel warm and sentimental despite yourself!Ecki (a very charismatic and hunky Maximilian Br&uuml;ckner) has grown up in a rural town, the son of a baker, and a committed soccer fan since childhood.  Now as a young man he is sought after by his girlfriend Cordula (Melody Sitta) but is unable to respond to her advances.  As the popular goalie on his soccer team he is hailed until quite by accident he is discovered in warm embrace with a teammate: the teammate and the team  trash him for being gay, his father (Dietmar B&auml;r) throws him out of the house, and poor Ecki departs for Dortmund to live with his sister, swearing to his team that he will return with a gay soccer team to defeat the homophobic jerks.Ecki and his sister Susanne (Lisa Potthoff) pair off to find gay team players and find them they do, in the strangest places (this is where the film sags due to the stereotypes the director elected to cast).  Ecki creates a solid team, falls in love with his sister's co-worker nurse Sven (David Rott) and despite some minor setbacks, the team boards the bus to return to Ecki's hometown to face off the enemy home team. Yes, it ends as you would imagine, but along the way the writer and director manage to make a few healthy comments about being true to yourself and your convictions.Despite everything predictable about the film, the actors - Br&uuml;ckner, Roth, Potthoff, B&auml;r, Carlo Ljubek, Saskia Vester et al - bring a homespun credibility to the story.  This is one of those films that requires forgiving its shortcomings to just enjoy the ride.  Grady Harp, September 06"],["Director Berry Hormann's German film \"Guys & Balls\" does for the gay community what the recent American movie \"Pride\" did for African Americans. Ecki (Maximilian Bruckner) is a blond, goodlooking soccer player who gets drummed off his local small-town team when his arch rival Udo discovers him kissing another male. All hell breaks loose from all sides including his father who is not going to accept the fact that his son is gay. The director treats the subject with enough humor for everyone. The father early on goes through Ecki's closet and discovers a loud shirt that \"all of them wear,\" only to be reminded by his wife that the shirt belongs to him. There is a lot of locker-room humor that takes place in the locker room. Ecki's gay soccer team-- after getting kicked off his team for being gay, he organizes a group of motley gay men to challenge the heteros in a soccer match-- replaces naked girley photos in their lockers with naked men photos as well as other assorted sordid items.Although the ending is predictable and some of the characters are a tad stereotypical-- the three leather bikers, the effeminate character, closeted guy, et al., there are certainly touching moments. One of the bikers, for instance, has been forced out of his small son's life by an angry ex-wife; and the son of course misses his dad. Ecki's sister, for the most part except for her screaming at one point that all the goodlooking men are gay and therefore off limits, is very supportive of her brother, allowing him to move in with her when he leaves home to round up a new soccer team.Anyone who has ever marched in a gay pride parade, for instance, and felt his or her adrenalin flow when the gay-haters are shouting from the sidelines will love this movie. As one of the characters says, \"it has to do with respect.\""],["It was a good story line as far as I could tell. The story focused on the people and their quest to play soccer/foot ball, rather then the fact that they were gay. That was just the setting in which the drama played out. It is nice to see a movie where the protagonist is gay, and it treats him as a regular person, not some sterotyped characher of a person. There were no gratuitous sex scenes,because it wasn't about that anyway. If there was an English language vertion I would watch it again. I had a hard time keeping up with reading the subtitles."],["Film was made less than 10 years ago yet feltdated .  Stereotypes of gays and lesbians wereexcessive. Story was simple not in a good way."],["Take \"Bend it Like Beckham\" and substitute the young girls for an all-gay ( almost) men's soccer team.  Nothing particularly original here--with a most predictable ending. Guess who wins the soccer game between this all-gay team and the very homophobic former team of the lead character? But it is by no means a disaster.  The gay stereotypes are all over the place, but this movie never really intended to say anything particularly important. So if you want a sport's comedy with a focus, of sorts, on the gay community--this is it.  But don't expect to learn very much or to see the interaction of characters with any sort of depth to them."],["I usually hate subtitled movies but this one I enjoyed. It is a bit  slow in certain parts but casting and an unexpeceted script make enjoyable. There were predictable outcomes but the situational comedy was great."],["Charming can-do story.  A pleasant divertisement for a summer evening.  Gay soccer goalie is taunted by winning team and team mates - sets out of find gay team for a match - his adventures in finding the team members, training, and ultimately the game and its aftermath are light comedy with many positive endings.  Altogether, it is a modestly uplifting and pleasantly enjoyable movie."],["This will not be an Oscar winner but it is one that will be there for you when you had a bad day or when winter gets to you !!!!In the league of Full Monty it is all predictible.It is funny - soft and the actors are good looking too.A very good quality / feel good movie a good little wine and pizza to go with it  PERFECT.And you don't have to be a footy fan to enjoy !!!"],["A nice feel good movie. Attractive and sweet central characters easy to cheer for. Funny, entertaining and timely.

He has loved soccer almost all his life and his forced outing crushes his dreams. I don't think you can get a meaner, more despecible character as Udo, there is absolutely nothing good, likable or positive about him. An array of misfit, lovable, unique characters add to spice of story. Outcasts, they find a bond to be together, a gay soccer team.How could Sven not fall in love with Ecki or Ecki with Sven? It's Ecki first love and it's true and strong. Sven is the first for him in every way.I thought the acting was brilliant and so helpful to see a German movie of inocence, warmth and love."],["There isn't much in the way of criticism I have for this fun and interesting and colorful (and German) sports movie (which isn't really about sports.)The characters are a bunch of gay misfits who take on the evil (and straight) soccer studs of the primary character's hometown.  It's the underdog story done with a gay team and in German style and language.  It's worth wading through the subtitles and covers a range of gay and family issues.  It's topical and refreshing, and the ending is suitably fun.This is a film worth your time.  It's a charmer gay underdog story with a fresh German flair.

It's as good as this one.Happy to have both of the films in my collection."],["This is an endearing story, without too much focus on nudity and sex."],["Okay so it's not Fassbinder or Wenders. It's not supposed to be. Lighthearted romantic comedy which like the French film 'Times Have Been Better', is a realistic portrayal of the tensions within a family when you come out of the closet, coupled with the tensions in the community when you are rejected. I liked the fact that the main characters single purpose in the film is not to escape small town life and automatically accept the default position of moving to the big city and starting his new gay life there. While for some people that's acceptable, the main character in this film will not be tossed out of his family and community, simply because of his coming out. It's the opposite of 'Big Eden' where most people in that small town were accepting. This is a tad more realistic in that the testosterone driven world of soccer in Germany and conservative small-town values, are only challenged when gays and lesbians have the courage to come out, stand up for who we are, and demand decent treatment and equal rights. Well told, a film can be inspiring even when it's main message is fairly simple.Three cheers."],["This is the first gay movie that I can actually say I have fun watching. This is a German movie with subtitles. It is made on the style of \"The Mighty Ducks\", a fun family movie, unfortunately not for the kiddies because of the subject matter. It was surprising to me to see a production company name in the credits, a subsidiary of a major studio associated with family type movies. I suppose I recognized the style.The story still the same old theme of coming out and being alienated by peers, friends, and family members. But the line up of all these oddball characters make us forget for a moment the pain, makes us laugh, and root for the winners.Ecki is a young man who works in a bakery with his father and mother in a small town in Germany. He is a goalie for the local soccer team. One night after a loss by the goalie, they still went ahead and celebrate. One of the other players, Udo, resented the fact that Ecki has lost the match for them. Ecki gets drunk looses his cool and kisses one of the other member of his team. He then gets chastised by his entire team and friends, town people, and his own father. In a moment of anger, he challenges Udo that a gay team will beat them, and sets a date for game.Because his family are not too happy with him, he moves to a big city, where his sister (a nurse) lives and works. After coming out to Susane, he tells about his challenge in his hometown, and starts recruiting players for his gay team. He meets this other good looking young male nurse, Vater, at Susane's job, and he comes out to him and wants to join the team. A relationship flourish from this.Ecki finds all sort of gay men, from hardcore bikers, two former professional African soccer players, an Arab working in a fast food restaurant, a washed out professional soccer player who owns the soccer field where they train as ball players. Relationships, friendships, bonding, all grow to make these people good enough team players. There are ups and downs but at the end they come out stronger. The final date arrives and the gay team wins the match with both guys facing each other, Udo and Ecki. Ecki regains his face in the town by blocking Udo's kick and the gay winning the match.At the end, Vater and Ecki hold hands. Ecki introduces Vater to his father. Ecki's father accepts Ecki as gay. And the movie ends with a happy ending.This is great movie, again with a style of a family movie. Here are the underdogs fighting a better and stronger team. With all the screwballs, their coach, the former washed out professional player, puts character and discipline into men, re-examining his own life, accepting at the end he is not a looser. All of the men are ordinary looking guys making the movie a bit more realistic. Even though the two main characters, Vater and Ecki are cute, they are not extraordinarily handsome like most other coming out movies actors. \"Summer Storm\" has a similar theme where a rowing gay team (which exist in real life in Berlin) beats a straight rowing team.

Bumblyburg is getting ready to celebrate its 300th anniversary, but someone isn't happy about it.Bad Apple has just moved into town and has a score to settle.  With the help of her sidekick worm, she spins a web of temptation that traps people in what they love most.  She wants to take over the town and has set her sites on the mayor, a news reporter, and LarryBoy himself.  Will LarryBoy fall prey to her plot?  Can he overcome his love of chocolate to save the day?I'll confess, as much as I love the VeggieTales series, the LarryBoy episodes are some of my least favorite.  I actually wasn't looking forward to this release, but I got it anyway.  I'm glad to be proved wrong.The plot, while predictable, is fun.  Larry has never been the smartest of the Veggie characters, but they don't make his stupid here, a complaint in the earlier LarryBoy shorts.  And the story is funny with several great lines and site gags along the way to entertain kids and adults alike.While most Veggie videos cram two stories into their 45-minute running time, this episode only features the one story.  They don't even break for a \"Silly Songs with Larry\" segment.  However, they do include the counter top wrap around with Bob, Larry, and Archibald Asparagus.  These scenes are easily some of the funniest they've done in several episodes.  I was laughing the entire way through them.  The video does include a new LarryBoy theme song, \"Rock on LarryBoy.\"  Performed by \"Shux,\" they feature a new vegetable we haven't seen before.  I bet you can guess what they might be.The theme here is obviously temptation, and they do a great job showing both the power of it and our need for God and others to help us through.  My only complaint is that all the temptations shown here are things that are ok in moderation like video games, TV, and chocolate.  Of course, since previous LarryBoy episodes have dealt with lying and gossip, this is a minor issue.  Still, parents will probably want to point out that some temptations should never be given into.The DVD comes with the standard Veggie goodies.  We've got an audio commentary and behind the scenes feature for the adults and storybooks and games for the kids.  The animation continues to improve with each episode, and the full surround sound is great as always.I may have to go back and give the previous LarryBoy episodes a chance.  If they are as good as this one, I've written off a great character in the Veggie universe."],["I loved this movie alot,it is simple but shows how everyone has a weeknes spot for temptation. it helped me as a mom and it helped my kids too."],["Don't get me wrong, this was a nice story, with good morals, but it's (obviously) based on a very fictional world.  What happened to the old VeggieTales shows where they based their story off of a real Biblical story?This series is quickly becoming just a 'good' show to watch, and not one where your children are going to learn about stories from the Bible."],["As with all videos from the Veggie Tales family, this is aimed at younger children.

I would definetly recomend this to my friends."],["Love all the Veggie Tale VideosThis particular DVD will not turn off the Closed Captioning."],["My two-year-old loves this movie as much as (possibly more than) any of our other Veggie Tales DVDs. The music in it is a little more contemporary and less childish than most VT flicks, and most of it has a beat that my daughter can dance to (which is very important to her since she loves music and dancing)! Whereas many of the other VT videos keep her attention for about half of the show, it isn't rare for her to be captivated from start to finish with this one, which is significant since she is usually a wild, spirited, energetic child. I'm not sure if it's the different music or the bright colors or even the apple (since it's her favorite fruit), but she is totally in it!All the temptation areas presented in the show - video games, appearances, and chocolate (and even gambling when they flash back to Bumblyburg in olden days) - are all common struggles for kids and adults alike. My daughter isn't old enough to have conversations about this, but it has sparked some good talks with children I've worked with in Sunday school at my church. I look forward to being able to have these discussions with her eventually!Finally, I know some reviewers of Larry Boy movies have argued that they aren't as good as other VT movies since they're not based on Bible stories, but I prefer Larry Boy and other original stories for a couple reasons: 1) the stories are always rooted in Biblical principles, so it still teaches them God's word and 2) I often find myself un-teaching the VT-version of a Bible story in Sunday school when a child tries to argue that it was different in Veggie Tales so my version (from the Bible) must be wrong."],["My grandson loves these Veggie Tale movies.

While TLC are always excellent, Sandman had alot of excellent ladder matches in ECW. Anybody remember them? Todd Grisham should not host anther WWE dvd, he made the dvd seem childish.

(sorry for the spelling)"],["The ladder match and the Hardys made me fall in love with wrestling in my preteen years, so its great to see a DVD that is basically dedicated to both (after all, Matt and Jeff are partly responsible for putting the match on the map). I like that the WWE went way back with the history of ladder matches and the selection here is great overall. I'm also very glad that only one or two of these matches overlap to the \"Edge: A Decade of Decadence\" DVD. Since he's been an integral part of the evolution of the ladder match, it would have been easy for duplicate matches to appear on both DVDs. Its good to see that WWE took the time to make sure this wasn't the case.One thing struck me as odd, however: In the RAW match between RVD and Eddie, there is a shot where Eddie is climbing the ladder and the camera cuts to Benoit in the crowd. While the shot is on Benoit you hear the ladder crash, and the camera cuts back to the ring with Eddie and the ladder on the ground. Now, I watched this episode live on TV with a friend and in that moment a fan in a D-X shirt ran out and knocked the ladder over. Needless to say, this made us FREAK OUT, and explains why Eddie looks so pissed all of a sudden! I just find it silly that the WWE felt the need to edit this \"one in a million\" moment out. Come on guys, learn to laugh at yourselves a little!But anyway, great and extensive DVD set!

Cena is obviously pissed at Edge towards the end of the match.Cena took a chair shot to the head and when it was Edge's turn to re-pay the favor he really missed it. They were not on the same page in the second-half. Cena would have Edge knocked down outside the ring and would be heading back in the ring and Edge would just be laying there and Cena would have to putter up the ladder.

When I bought this, it was actually to replace the one that was lost.

However, the ladder that was used is quite humorous and is worth a look.2) Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels (1992): Decent action all around, but HBK didn't utilize the ladder as well as he would have later on his career.3) Shawn Michaels vs. Razor Ramon (Summerslam 1995): Great chemistry displayed by both wrestlers when they are actually wrestling, and some good spots when they used the ladder.4) Triple H vs. The Rock (Summerslam 1998): The Rock lays the smack down on Triple H and Triple H does the same. Great match.5) Edge & Christian vs. New Brood (No Mercy 1999): Fast-paced action with great uses of the ladder. A classic.6) Dudley Boyz vs. Edge & Christian vs. Hardy Boyz (1st Ever TLC Match Summerslam 2000): THIS IS THE BEST MATCH ON THIS 3 DISC COLLECTION! This match was out of control from the very beginning. Lots of \"ow!\" moments plus three ABSOLUTELY SICK spots. Bubba Ray Dudley flies through four tables! Jeff Hardy does a Swanton Bomb off a 20 foot ladder and goes through a table. Matt Hardy falls off the ladder inside the ring and lands outside on a table. This match was ridiculous and I was surprised all of these guys made it out without any serious injuries.7) 3 Count vs. Jung Dragons vs. Jamie Knoble & Evan Karagias (WCW, Starrcade 2000): Good action with an innovative use of some ladders at the end.8) Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho (Royal Rumble 2001): An average ladder match , but one of the best spots I've ever seen when Benoit flies through the ropes to spear Jericho, but Jericho nails him with a chair.Disc 2 -1) Edge & Christian vs. Dudley Boyz vs. Hardy Boyz (TLC II, Wrestlemania 17): Had about the same results as the first TLC match, but Matt Hardy and Bubba Ray both go through four tables this time! Jeff Hardy once again does a Swanton Bomb off a 20 Foot Ladder (how can he still wrestle?). Rhino, Spike Dudley, and Lita all get involved in this match and all do some nice spots. Another TLC match, another trainwreck!2) Edge & Christian vs. Chris Jericho & Chris Benoit vs. Hardy Boyz vs. Dudley Boyz (Smackdown 2001): This is a Smackdown match, but with PPV action! This is the match where Benoit breaks his neck after doing a diving headbutt outside the ring. Fast-paced action with good bumps = success.3) Christian vs. Edge (No Mercy 2001): This was a disappointing match since it was very slow-paced. There were some nice spots at the end, but overall mediocre.4) Eddie Guerrero vs. Rob Van Dam (Raw 2002): Another TV match with PPV action. Good action with RVD taking a lot of painful bumps and Eddie at point does a nice athletic spot off the top of the ladder.5) Undertaker vs. Jeff Hardy (Raw 2002): Taker takes some damage from the ladder, but Jeff Hardy gets punished for most of the match. Taker admires Jeff's courage at the end of the match.6) Kane & The Hurricane vs. RVD & Jeff Hardy vs. Bubba Ray Dudley & Spike Dudley vs. Chris Jericho & Christian (Raw 2002): The Hurricane wasn't in this match. Good PPV action here with Jeff Hardy doing yet another Swanton Bomb off the top of a ladder outside the ring.7) Chris Jericho vs. Christian (Unforgivin 2004): Decent action with Jericho doing most of the good work.Disc 3 -1) Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho vs. Edge vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Christian vs. Kane (1st Ever Money in the Bank Ladder Match, Wrestlemania 21): Shelton Benjamin stole the show here doing some really athletic moves including the Spiderman jump onto the ladder out of nowhere. Great action and lots of sick bumps makes this a classic.2) Eddie Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio (Summerslam 2005): Great chemistry by both wrestlers with some innovative uses of the ladder not seen on the first two discs.3) Edge vs. Matt Hardy (Raw 2005): This match was fast-paced from the very beginning and they do some nice spots too. Great effort by both wrestlers.4)Edge vs. Ric Flair (TLC match, Raw 2006): Decent action, but made entertaining with Ric Flair's crimson mask and a good table spot.5) John Cena vs. Edge (Unforgiven 2006): I knew Edge would do his part in this match, but was unsure of Cena. Cena ended up suprising me with some sweet spots off the ladder. At the end, Cena does the FU on Edge from a ladder and Edge goes through two tables!6) Jeff Hardy vs. Johnny Nitro (Raw 2006): Good action when Jeff Hardy is doing his thing, but the match slowed down when Nitro was in control. However, Nitro did a good job of receiving some punishment.7) Paul London & Brian Kendrick vs. MNM vs. Hardys vs. William Regal & Dave Taylor (Armageddon 2006): Great action delivered by everyone with some sick bumps, including Joey Mercury getting his nose broken after getting it destroyed via a ladder! He rolled to the outside of the ring where blood was pouring everywhere and his face was just a mess. That definitely was not fake!Overall, this is one of the best WWE DVDs to come out and it's well worth the money. The replay value is high."],["You guys are friggen idiots. Seriously. Of course WWE is going to keep putting out these DVDs, because millions of people like me are going to buy them. Isn't the point of a company to make money???

This DVD is going to be awesome."],["It's amazing how a simple concept for a match (climb up a ladder & grab the belt) has spawn so many memorable moments in the history of professional wrestling and WWE picked out a wonderful collection of matches here to illistrate how the ladder match has spawn off so many memorable to classic moments in wrestling & was also the catalist for so many versions of this match including TLC, Stairway To Hell in ECW, and King Of The Mountain in TNA.North American Champion Jake Roberts vs. Big Daddy Ritter (Junkyard Dog) - This was joined in progress and it was using a one sided ladder with the referees holding it steady while the wrestlers climbed up. Nothing special past the historical factor.Stampede Wrestling '79Intercontinental Champion Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels - Two years before the more famous ladder match between Shawn & Razor Ramon would happen at WrestleMania, the very first ladder match in WWE history happened here. Both men went away from their usual strategy in matches of wrestling & were brawling more with Sherri becoming a distraction from time to time. The ladder was used as a weapon here with Shawn ramming it into Bret while Shawn was later given a slingshot into it. It wasn't anywhere near the standards of this type of match today but the purpose here was just to show the concept of the match which it did achieve.July '92[Greatest Rivalries: Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels]Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels vs. Razor Ramon - The \"forgotten\" rematch from WrestleMania X that was very different than their previous encounter as the \"behind the scenes\" story about this match was revealed years later in that they weren't allowed to use the ladder as a weapon here.  Razor took the fight to Shawn by first suplexing Shawn from inside the ring straight to the floor & then focusing heavily on his leg after pushing the ladder down causing it to be trapped inside the ladder followed by punishing it by stomping on his leg wedged in the ladder & dropping Shawn onto the ladder leg first.  Shawn was able to dish out the punishment himself by back-suplexing Razor off the ladder &  throwing him so hard into a ladder in the corner that he flipped over the top rope while also using the ladder to execute big moves like a moonsault & an attempt at a big splash but unfortunately was also on the receiving end of a Razor's Edge off the ladder.  A second was brought into play leading to one moment where both men fell off the ladder & crotched on the ropes.  I'm glad they put this one on here as it didn't disappoint & lived up to the hype & expectations based off their previous ladder match.  As a side note, if you want an idea of how comical WWF was back in '95 then watch Shawn Michaels entrance when they have a guy trying to sell you his merchandise at ringside (ala Home Shopping Network).SummerSlam '95Intercontinental Champion The Rock vs. Triple H - Just a couple of notes before the match but the DX band played Triple H & Chyna to the ring, The Rock debuted a new version of his \"Nation\" theme while Mark Henry was in Rock's corner, and Triple H was coming into the match with a bad leg based off an attack earlier in the night.  Both men started out in the ring before the brawl continued into the isleway with Triple H being thrown into the ladder leaning against the ring.  Triple H swinging it into Rock followed by driving it into his ribs before Rock recovered & went right to work on that bad leg with stomps & elbow drops before using the ladder to wedge the leg & stomp on it along with using a chair to hammer the ladder into Triple H's leg.  Rock was ruthless by dropping Triple H onto the ladder leg first before Triple H was catapulted & backdropped onto it various times before Rock eventually dropped a People's Elbow with Triple H on the ladder.  The Rock & Triple H just have that natural chemistry that carries over into each match & this was no different in a classic quality match that told a great story.SummerSlam '98[The Epic Journey Of Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson]Edge & Christian vs. New Brood (Hardy Boyz) - This was the not only the first tag team ladder match in WWE history but also the finals of a series of matches between both teams called the Terri Invitational Tournament (which allowed Jerry Lawler to have so much fun with the initials) in which the winning team would gain an amount of money & her managerial services.  Gangrel was ejected from ringside early on in the match allowing this match to be straight up between both teams with them having so many highlight moments such as Jeff being backdropped over the top rope all the way to the middle of the isleway, Christian giving Jeff a reverse DDT off a ladder, Edge powerbombing Matt off the ladder, Jeff's missle dropkick off the top rope knocking Edge off the ladder followed by a swanton bomb on the ladder, Christian on the receiving end of a legdrop off the top rope from Jeff who leapfrogged over a ladder in the process, Jeff Hardy being a handyman by breaking a ladder & then fixing it, Edge & Christian delivering a baseball slide with the ladder into Matt's crotch, Edge receiving a neckbreaker off the ladder, and all four men \"crashing & burning\" off the ladders.  This was the match that put both teams on the map that would eventually plant the seeds for the future series of ladder/T.L.C. matches featuring various members. Since this was the first tag team ladder match, it was non-stop action & never a dull moment.No Mercy '99[Hardy Boyz: Leap Of Faith; Edge: Decade Of Decadence]T.L.C. Match: WWE Tag Team Champions Edge & Christian vs. Dudley Boyz vs. Hardy Boyz - This was the first ever T.L.C. match which is the same concept as a ladder match except tables & chairs were also legal & encouraged to be used as well while it should also be noted that this was a homecoming for the Hardy's with them being from North Carolina.  You had various crazy moments with all three weapons being legal such as Edge legsweeping both Devon & Matt off ladder, Bubba powerbombing Christian off a ladder, Edge pushing Jeff off a ladder that caused another ladder to catapult into Matt's face, Christian getting a 3D through a table, Edge hitting everyone in sight with a chair, Christian launched into Edge who was sandwiched in between a ladder, Jeff's swanton bomb off a ladder through tables, Bubba going off a ladder in the ring through stacked tables on the outside, Lita getting involved & paying for it, Matt falling backwards off a ladder out of the ring through tables, and Devon & Jeff hanging from the tag titles.  This was a \"car crash\" that took your breathe away.SummerSlam '00[Hardy Boys: Leap Of Faith; Allied Powers: World's Greatest Tag Teams]Shannon Moore & Shane Helms vs. Jamie Noble & Evan Karagis vs. Kaz Hayashi & Jimmy Yang - It was during this period in WCW that the crusierweight division had the most focus on it than it has in over a year with all six of these men stealing the show every chance they had but this match was different in that although it's setup as a three team ladder match, the one person who grabs the contract at the top would receive the title match against Crusierweight Champion Chavo Guerrero who also joined in on commentary for this match.  This match had it's moments full of crazy spots & moments like Yang dropkicking the ladder into Noble & Evan followed by Kaz doing a moonsault onto the ladder with both underneath, a botched backdrop on Kaz that caused him to land on his head instead of the ladder, back to back to back various dives from the ring to the outside with Noble being shoved off the ladder onto everyone on the outside, another ladder being brought into the match to be made a scaffold where Evan caught Kaz & powerslammed him off of it, Shane Helms with the \"world's highest neckbreaker\", and Shannon Moore's headscissors taking Yang off the scaffold to the floor.  If you only know these guys from their runs in WWE then you don't know what your missing as this match was the match of the night at that PPV as it was the crusierweight division that was saving the WCW product at that time. It wasn't as crazy as the T.L.C. matches in WWE but these guys put on one hell of a performance in what many consider the last quality Starrcade match in the history of the event.WCW Starrcade '00Intercontinental Champion Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho - Chris Jericho came into this match with a bad arm which Benoit targeted right away only for Jericho to initially be able to counter the attacks but Benoit went to work after Jericho missed a springboard dropkick by throwing Jericho into both the steps & ring post shoulder first.  Jericho was able to get to the ladder first & used it to his advantage by ramming it into Benoit's face & ribs but also ended up in the receiving end of a ladder attack being thrown into the ladder face first onto the floor before Benoit then attempted a suicide dive but caught a chair to the head mid-air.  Both men continued to take hard hits with the ladder as they connected with it face first at various points such as Benoit dropkicking the ladder into Jericho's face before he would later feel the effects of a modified Walls Of Jericho on the ladder before Benoit would knock Jericho off the ladder into the crossface.  This wasn't your \"car crash spotfest\" type of ladder match more than it was an aggressive brawl with the ladder used as a weapon more than anything else.Royal Rumble '01T.L.C. Match: WWE Tag Team Champions Dudley Boyz vs. Hardy Boyz vs. Edge & Christian - The rematch from SummerSlam here at WrestleMania except this one also including each team's associates (Spike Dudley, Rhyno, Lita) getting in the action as well.  You got all the crazy spots as expected here such as Bubba powerbombing Jeff onto Edge through a table, Christian falling off a ladder in the ring straight to the floor, Spike Dudley delivering a dudley dog off the apron through a table on the floor, Rhyno giving a gore through a table, various loud chairshots to the head, Jeff Hardy doing a swanton bomb off the highest ladder through a table & later attempting to walk on the ladders like a tightrope, Matt & Bubba falling out off the ladder through the stacked tables at ringside, and the highlight reel of Edge spearing Jeff while he was hanging from the tag titles that WWE used in promotional videos for years after this match.  T.L.C. II followed the same patterns as their previous matches in that this was full of \"Holy S...\" moments one after another.WrestleMania X-7[Hardy Boys: Leap Of Faith]T.L.C. Match: WWE Tag Team Champions Chris Jericho & Chris Benoit vs. Dudley Boyz vs. Hardy Boyz vs. Edge & Christian - This match is known as the \"forgotten T.L.C.\" for various reasons such as Edge not acknowledging this match when he kept saying \"I never lost a T.L.C. match\" along with the fact that it happened last minute on broadcast TV instead of how the previous matches were built up on TV for months leading to the PPV.  Various highlights include Jeff having a ladder thrown at him in the middle of Poetry Of Motion, Benoit snap suplexing Bubba onto the ladder, Jericho bulldogging Bubba off the ladder, Walls Of Jericho on the top of the ladder, Edge & Christian pushed off the ladders onto the outside, the Hardys being hiptossed & suplexed off ladders, various chairshots to the head & people falling through tables, a Twist Of Fate off the ladder, Edge's spear off the ladder, and Benoit's diving headbutt that injured him causing him to miss action for a year.\"SmackDown\" May '01Intercontinental Champion Christian vs. Edge - Two of the men who are known for reinventing the ladder match now go at it in that same match they made famous that made action both in the ring along with the outside & through the crowd.  The ladder was used as a weapon various times like to cause damage to the ribs like a baseball slide, Christian crotched on it, a catapult into Edge's face, being slammed off the top rope onto it, setup as a scaffold on chairs leading up to a big top rope splash, and Edge getting his receipts on all the acts Christian did to him over the past two months.No Mercy '01Intercontinental Champion Eddie Guerrero vs. Rob Van Dam - \"The Battle Of The Frog Splash\" continues & after their previous two encounters, the score would be settled in a ladder match.  Both men had various spots & moments such as Eddie whipping RVD face first into the ladder followed by targeting his legs using a chair & the post, RVD's moonsaults onto Eddie on the ladder, Eddie taking punishment like having the ladder dropkicked from under him followed by a tilt-a-wirl backbreaker onto the ladder & Rolling Thunder on the ladder, and Eddie's sunset flips off the ladder into a powerbomb & cannonball.  This was very fast paced & intense from start to finish and was without a doubt one of the best matches on WWE TV for that year.\"RAW\" May '02[Eddie Guerrero: Cheating Death, Stealing Life]WWE Undisputed Champion Undertaker vs. Jeff Hardy - Despite Undertaker being in WWE for over a decade at this point, this was his first ever ladder match against one of the masters of this match.  Jeff brought the fight to Taker doing everything he could do including a chairshots to the head, legdropping the ladder on top of Taker, and using dirty tactics like a low blow.  Taker brought the pain using the ladder to his advantage like knocking Hardy into the announce table, using a chair multiple times himself, and legdrop on the apron with Hardy ladder the ladder.  The story behind this match was Undertaker just delivering a beating to Jeff Hardy who just refused to quit & give up...to the point where Taker just had to do what he had to do after the match.\"RAW\" July '02T.L.C. Match: World Tag Team Champion Kane vs. Rob Van Dam & Jeff Hardy vs. Bubba & Spike Dudley vs. Chris Jericho & Christian - They advertise Hurricane for this match but he wasn't in it due to Ric Flair & Triple H attacking him before the match causing Kane to defend the tag titles alone.  This was a \"car crash\" as you would expect here with such moments like Bubba's airplane spin with the ladder, Spike being tossed into RVD, the ladder catapulting into Christian & Jericho's face, Hardy's legdrop on Kane through a table, Jeff being caught in midair into a powerslam, the Van Daminator & Van Terminator, Christian launched off top rope into ladder, Bubba delivering a superplex off the ladder, Spike being shoved over the top rope onto the table, and back to back Bubba Bomb & 5 Star Frog Splash.  High spots & moments all over the place along with high impact moves to the point to where Bubba Ray suffered such a concussion that he doesn't remember the match to this day.\"RAW\" Oct. '02[RAW: 10th Anniversary]Intercontinental Championship Match: Chris Jericho vs. Christian - These two were feuding with each other for months over Trish Stratus but after going through regular matches, handicap matches, and cage matches (where Christian injured his back & was out of action for months) they settled their score in a ladder match for the Intercontinental Championship after Edge had to forfeit the title due to injury.  Both men started out wrestling before it turned into a brawl in the crowd & the outside using the cable cord to choke while Christian was able to do his Unprettier on the floor.  The ladder then came into play with both men being thrown into the ladder, ladder using it as a weapon like Jericho using it to work on Christian's back while Jericho's leg was damaged when thrown into it, and making moves more impactful like the Lionsault & bulldog, and both men taking face first falls from the ladder & even from the hanging title.  This match was more about trying to tell a story throughout the match instead of doing a bunch of \"high spots\" & turned out to be a great match.Unforgiven '04Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Kane vs. Edge vs. Christian - This was the first ever Money In The Bank match where the object of the match is to grab the briefcase at the top that contains a contract to challenge any World Champion whenever he sees fit in the next year.  As expected with a multiman ladder match, chaos all over the place with everyone going after Kane on the ramp before the bell, everyone diving on top of everyone else on the outside, Benoit crossfacing anyone in sight, Benjamin splashing Edge in the corner on the ladder, everyone fighting on 3 ladders at once, Edge T-Bone'd off the ladder, and Benoit's headbutt off the ladder that caused him to bleed from the head.  I was here LIVE & to quote Joey Styles \"OH MY GOD!\" The show-stealer here though was Shelton Benjamin as he looked like Spider Man with the majority of the moves he was pulling off involving the ladders. As a side note, watch Kane's intro because that was something to see with the ladders on fire.WrestleMania 21Rey Mysterio vs. Eddie Guerrero - This was similar to the Money In The Bank match where the object was to grab the briefcase hanging at the top but in this case, the briefcase contains custody papers of Rey's adopted son & Eddie's biological son Dominic.  Various moments include Rey being thrown into the ladder in the isleway, Eddie bringing in a second ladder before Rey baseball slide it into Eddie's face followed by a springboard seated dive onto Eddie on the outside, an attempted sunset flip powerbomb that had both men hitting the back of their heads, Rey on the receiving end of a hilo while he was sandwiched between ladders, Rey backdropped Eddie onto a slanted ladder than collapsed the ladder Rey himself was on, using the ladder to do a unique 619 & springboard legdrop, Rey taking an impactful powerbomb from hanging off the hook, and the 3 Amigos onto the ladder.  It was a great ladder match even though the storyline got stupid with the whole \"Dominic is my son\" thing going on...well, it did result in the \"I'm Your Papi\" shirt so I guess it's not all bad.SummerSlam '05Loser Leaves Raw/Money In The Bank Ladder Match vs. Matt Hardy - The final encounter between these two (three if you involve Lita) in this very personal feud against each other to the point where they dished out the most punishment possible & not hold anything back.  Both men took some hard hits & delivered them with the ladder such as Edge being squeezed in an upside down ladder scissors, Matt being either dropped into or back suplexed or hitting face first into the top or suplexed into the ladder stomach first, a sequence that starts with Edge being shoved off a ladder & ends with Matt crashing & burning off another ladder, Matt's crossbody off the ladder onto Edge in the crowd, Twist Of Fate off the top of ladders, and Lita getting involved along with weapons like kendo sticks & tables.  This was unlike their previous matches as a tag team where it was one spot after another as this was came off more like a fight that was very aggressive from beginning to end.\"RAW\" Oct. '05[The Life Story Of Edge]T.L.C. Match: WWE Champion Edge vs. Ric Flair - At this stage in Flair's career, this was a completely new environment for him as this was his very first ladder match in his hometown against \"the master of the T.L.C. match\" with his daughter at ringside.  Knowing how Flair suffered a concussion the week before, Edge targeted Flair's head by attacking it with the ladder & chair that ended up busting him open while also going after his back by putting Flair through a table & even delivering a supersuplex from the ladder.  Flair delivered just as much punishment as he recieved returning the chairshots & pushing Edge off a ladder through a table on the floor.  This match was more about \"how can Flair take this punishment as his age\" than anything else resulting in a very impressive performance from Ric Flair in this being his first time doing this type of match at this stage in his career.\"RAW\" Jan. '06WWE Championship/T.L.C. Match vs. John Cena - Edge's had the heavy advantage going into this match as he returned home to a hero's welcome in Toronto as the WWE Champion defending with his own \"Rated R\" WWE Championship in the match he's the innovator & master of.  Edge showcased this fact by dishing out the punishment like giving Cena a DDT into chairs, dropkicking the ladder off the guardrail into Cena's face, powerslamming him through a table, running up a ladder to the top rope followed by a crossbody to Cena on the outside, a ladder to ladder spear, and Lita getting involved causing both men to crash through tables.  Cena himself gave as much as he took to Edge by hip tossing him into the ladder & later delivering his throwback into a chair, applying his STFU with Edge trapped in the ladder, FUing the ladder onto Edge, powerbombing Edge into the ladder, and giving Edge the biggest FU we've ever seen.Unforgiven '06[The Life Story Of Edge]Intercontinental Champion Johnny Nitro vs. Jeff Hardy - This was Jeff Hardy's first ladder match since his return to WWE while this the first one in Nitro's career leading to such spots as Jeff's Whisper In The Wind that took as much out of Jeff as it did Nitro, Jeff's crossbody onto the ladder that Nitro was holding, Nitro's standing dropkick from the top of a ladder onto Jeff who also on the ladder, Hardy's swanton bomb onto a ladder, and a ladder being thrown so hard that it wrapped around the other's head.  This was the match for me that put Nitro on the map as a \"superstar of the future\" as he was able to hold his own & surpass the previous RAW ladder matches with the ladder match veteran in Jeff Hardy.\"RAW\" Nov. '06WWE Tag Team Champions Paul London & Brian Kendrick vs. William Regal & Dave Taylor vs. MNM vs. The Hardys - This was originally set to be just a regular title match between London & Kendrick before Teddy Long gave us a Christmas gift with two additional teams & making this a ladder match.  We all know what the Hardys & MNM can do based on their past so mix that with the daredevil style London & Kendrick adapted along with the fact that Regal & Taylor didn't look out of place with their mat wrestling style as well leading to such spots like Mercury dropped off the top of the ladder straight to the outside floor, various wrestlers backdropped & suplexed into & off the top of the ladders, Jeff on top of a ladder on the outside before Nitro kicked the ladder through the ropes causing Jeff to fall off & land on ropes waist first, Jeff's sunset flip powerbomb on Nitro, Matt having the ladders split from under him, and watch out for that SICK spot where Joey Mercury's face gets crushed.Armageddon '06WWE didn't drop the ball like they did with the \"History Of WWE Championship\" set & picked out a bunch of matches available on multiple DVD sets (without counting the monthly PPV DVDs) so you know you'll be getting more than your money's worth & they do acknowledge the history of ladder matches before WrestleMania X (which they've said was the first ladder match). The only ladder match I've seen that I wish was on here was the Judgment Day 2003 match between Hass & Benjamin vs. Eddie Guerrero & Tajiri but you can't win them all. I highly recommend this."],["Fans who like a little extreme mixed with main event style drama and a lot of high spots, then this is THE package. A host of great performers giving the fans all they got. The only duds? The first \"classic\" match and the WCW match... the rest is gold."],["I'm very happy with this purchase.  It was delivered when it was expected.  It was packaged well.  Would highly recommend to fans of the ladder match."],["glad i bought it ...my grandson  gonna love it for a minute he watches it everyday after school .... ...i recommend it"],["Worth it only to hear J.R. utter the classic line during the Triple H/The Rock match: \"Why don't we ever talk about Sammy Sosa?\""],["A match that seems simple in concept but has turned into one of the most exciting but brutal bouts that wrestlers can ever participate in. This is a pro-WWE release but it does give a nod to Stampede Wrestling and to World Championship Wrestling. Anyway, here are the matches:Jake Roberts Vs. Big Daddy Ritter (aka the late great Junkyard Dog) - This was for the Stampede Wrestling North American title. No hard bumps, this was mostly an old school brawl. Worth a look just for the historical factor.Bret \"Hitman\" Hart Vs. Shawn \"HBK\" Michaels w/Sherri Martel (RIP) - This was for Bret's Intercontinental title. While nothing like the ladder matches Shawn would participate in later, it was a good bout with a few brutal spots.Shawn Michaels Vs. Razor Ramon - This was the ladder \"rematch\" from WrestleMania X. This time, Shawn was the I-C champion and Razor was the challenger (the roles were reversed in their previous encounter). This one was more fast paced and brutal than their first ladder meeting. A great match.Triple H Vs. The Rock - On a card that saw \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin Vs. The Undertaker as the main event, this match for the I-C title stoled the show at SummerSlam '98. HHH was mainly on the receiving end in this while The Rock was just vicious! While both men would go onto greatness, this match really launched The Rock in my view. Definitely a keeper.New Brood (The Hardyz) Vs. Edge & Christian - This match was for $50,000 and the managerial services of Terri Runnels. It set the tone for future ladder/TLC matches. I had never seen this bout until this collection and it was every bit as good as the hype I've heard on it.Edge & Christian Vs. The Hardyz Vs. The Dudleyz - The first TLC match. This is a match I can't begin to describe. You just have to watch.Shannon Moore & Shane Helms Vs. Jamie Noble & Evan Karagis Vs. Kaz Hayashi & Jimmy Yang - This was during the final days of WCW in late 2000. If all you know of these guys is WWE, then you really need to peep this. One thing that the WCW did better than WWE is the cruiserweight division and this ladder match was proof of that!Chris Benoit Vs. Chris Jericho - This was at the Royal Rumble 2001. Both men took some vicious bumps. One in particular was when Benoit dived through the ropes and got hit with a chair by Jericho! Not to mention his head bumped the floor as he landed. Not taking up for Benoit because of his recent actions but matches like this can make the case that he had brain damage look valid! OUCH!Hardyz Vs. Dudleyz Vs. Edge & Christian - This WrestleMania 17 bout was a rematch from SummerSlam 2000 and it was a TLC bout as well. It is still talked about today, particularly the part where Edge speared Jeff Hardy as Jeff was hanging from the hooks that held the WWE Tag Team Titles. I personally prefered the original TLC bout but this one was great as well.Hardyz Vs. Dudleyz Vs. Edge & Christian Vs. Chris Benoit & Chris Jericho -Proof that Edge HAS lost a TLC match prior to John Cena as Benoit and Jericho (the forgotten Canadian Chris') defended the WWE Tag titles against these three veterans. This bout saw Benoit injure his ribs but more seriously his neck as he did a diving headbutt through a table, missing Matt Hardy! This match is also significant because it took place on Smackdown TV!Edge Vs. Christian - This was for the I-C title during the infamous 'Invasion' angle. Given the experience of these two, you would've expected an amazing match but it something about it was just ordinary. A good match without question but something about it just wasn't great. Still worth a look.Rob Van Damn Vs. Eddie Gurrerro - Two words: SEE IT!Undertaker Vs. Jeff Hardy - Basically its The Undertaker dishing out a beating to Jeff Hardy but Jeff doesn't give up, even earning the respect of The Dead Man at the end. This was for the WWE Title by the way.Kane Vs. RVD/Jeff Hardy Vs. Buh Buh Ray & Spike Dudley Vs. Jericho & Christian - This was on Monday Night RAW and was for the World Tag Team Titles. Hurricane Helms was supposed to team with Kane but was jumped by HHH and Ric Flair earlier that night so Kane went alone in this match. This was a huge spotfest!Chris Jericho Vs. Christian - A great climax to their feud which began at WrestleMania 20 earlier that year. It told a very good story and it was for the I-C title.Chris Jericho Vs. Chris Benoit Vs. Shelton Benjamin Vs. Edge Vs. Christian Vs. Kane - This was at WrestleMania 21 and was the first Money In The Bank ladder match. Though Edge was the winner of this bout, the show was stoled by Shelton Benjamin! A great bout by all involved.Rey Mysterio Vs. Eddie Gurrerro - In one of his last PPV appearances before his untimely passing, Gurrerro took on Rey at SummerSlam 2005. While the angle that led to this match sucked a**, the match itself was amazing! Even the run-ins by Vickie Gurrerro and Dominic (Rey's real life son) didn't take away from this bout.Matt Hardy Vs. Edge - Another good bout that just fell short somehow. Again, much like Edge Vs. Christian, this was surprising given the experience between these two. This a good contest though but these two have done better (particularly their street fight on RAW and a cage match at Unforgiven 2005).Ric Flair Vs. Edge - This was amazing just for the fact that at near 60 years old, Flair was willing to take punishment like this! Edge won but this bout proved that Flair can work nearly any type of match!John Cena Vs. Edge - Amazing bout and one of Cena's better matches! He used his usual move set in very creative ways! You have to see it to believe it.Jeff Hardy Vs. Johnny Nitro (aka John Morrison) - Nasty Swanton Bomb onto the Ladder as Jeff tried to squash Johnny on it! Even Melina (Johnny's now ex-manager and ex-girlfriend in real life) was stunned on that move! Her reaction says it all. Overall, this was another great win for Jeff but it was also John's breakout performance.Paul London/Brian Kendrick Vs. William Regal/Dave Taylor Vs. MNM Vs. The Hardyz - What was supposed to be a WWE Tag Title match between the team of London/Kendrick Vs. Regal/Taylor was turned into a Ladder Match at the last minute with MNM and The Hardyz added! While everyone expected the champs, the Hardyz and MNM to do well, Regal and Taylor actually held their own in this match and didn't look out of place as their more traditional style was put to good use! This features Joey Mercury's infamous face crushing as well! For all those that swear that wrestlers don't get hurt! I have one word for you: WHATEVER! Make them watch that scene if nothing else!Overall, a very good release. When I bought this, I was concerned that they may have pulled the matches with Chris Benoit in them but there was so many other good ones I bought it anyway. Thankfully, they didn't. Not an endorsement of Benoit in any way but I don't like history being altered (especially wrestling history).The only other bouts I would've liked to have seen was Dusty Rhodes Vs. Tully Blanchard in their barbed wire ladder match from The Great American Bash 1987 and Tommy Dreamer Vs. Justin Credible in their Stairway To Hell ladder match from Guilty As Charged '99.Other than that, its a good buy!"],["This 3 Disc DVD Set is great, the matches shown on this DVD are the Best I Have ever seen.....Definitely a must buy if you are a wrestling fan"],["this has matches that surpass the wrestlemania x and 16 matches. if you want the wwe to make every one of the ladder matches ever made on a dvd set, then the set would be 5 to 10 discs long and a hefty price tag with it.sorry that the wwe thinks that ecw and wcw matches suck but remember they where enemies at one point and why would the wwe want to live on with those matches that remind you of those organizations? wcw and the orignal ecw are dead. if you don't like this selection then try to find a better onewwe, keep up the good work"],["I remember watching WMX when I saw my first ever ladder match between Razor Ramon and HBK, and that match will forever go as one of the greatest of all time in my books. WHY THE HECK WASN'T IT ON THIS DVD?!?! Anyways, it includes all of the other great ladder match, save for a few here and there. but how can you complain with 21, over 9 hours of the greatest matches in WWE history?Match listing:DISC 1:Jake Roberts Vs. Junkyard DogBoring, starts about 5 minutes in. They make no use of the ladder whatsoever. Very old match right here. 2/10Bret Hart Vs. HBKThe first ever ladder match in WWE history, and what a good one it was. The showstopper Vs. the hitman. They make better use of the ladder in this match, and it's a classic, and is a great example of the best 90's feud of all time. 6.5/10 (age got the best of it)HBK Vs. Razor Ramon Summerslam 1995I thought the WMX match was WAY better, but that doesn't mean this one sucks, it's actually really good. You have 2 of the greatest superstars ever in the WWE, and a ladder to determine the outcome. Not as good as their WMX match, but certainly better than others. 8/10Triple H Vs. The Rock Summerslam 1998Weird seeing Triple H in tights agin, I totally forgot about the early DX days, and boy was the summer of '98 an amazing one. They make pretty good use of the ladder, no really great spots, but still a good match between 2 guys who later became icons for the WWE. 7.5/10Edge & Christian Vs. New Brood (Hardy Boyz) No Mercy 1999First ever tag ladder match, and what an amazing one it was. This match will go down not only as one of the greatest ladder matches ever, but one of the best tag match ever. These 2 teams were just getting started in the WWE, and soon became icons for the greatest tag division ever in WWE history. Great match, great spots. 10/10First ever TLC match (Dudleyz Vs. Haryz Vs.E&C;) Summerslam 2000This match was evolutionary, and included 3 of the best tag teams ever in WWE histroy. So many amazing table spots, so many amazing ladder spots, so many amazing spots, period. Some of the best entertaininment, and best action ever in WWE history is in this match. Put all three teams to the test, and set the standard for the rest of the ladder matches to come. 10/10WCW ladder match (3 Count Vs. Jung Dragons Vs. Knoble/Karagias Starrcade 2000I was never really into WCW that much, but this match was ver ygood because I love cruiser weight type wrestling. I've heard many bash this match, but I enjoyed it. They made good use of the ladders, but you can tell these guys were lost at first. 7.5/10Chris Benoit Vs. Chris Jericho Royal Rumble 2001This was one of the better 1on1 ladder matches. A really amazing chair shot with Benoit diving through the ropes and Jericho crashing his skull in. You really get to see what these 2 had to offer, and the walls of Jericho on the top of the ladder. 8.5/10DISC 2:TLC 2 WM X-SevenThis match wasn't as god as TLC 1, but was darn near close. Some really amazing spots using tables, and some really nice ladder usage. Highlights incluse a 20 foot spear, and a 20 foot Swanton bomb. Very great match from a very great PPV including once again 3 of the great teams in WWE history. 10/10TLC 3 (Hardyz Vs. E&C; Vs. Dudleyz Vs. Benoit/Jericho)This will go down as one of the greatest matches ever on Smackdown! and one of the greatest matches period. This is a historic match not only being the first ladder match on WWE TV, but the first ever fatal 4-way. Benoit gets a nasty 13 month injury because of this match, but he still puts on a darn good show. Great action from all 4 teams. blurring was terrible in this match though. 9.5/10Christian Vs. Edge No Mercy 2001These 2 were one of the greatest tag teams ever, and this is at the point where they break up, and feud. They made their names known at No mercy '99, and they settle their differences at No Mercy '01. This is a very good match, One of the greatest I've seen from the both of them, only to be outshined by their cage match. 7/10Eddie Guerrero Vs. RVDThis was the second ever vroadcast ladder match for WWE, and one of my personal favorite 1on1 ladder matches. These 2 were some of the greatest wrestlers WWE ever had. 2 great high flyers, an amazing feud. This match is jst a taste of what they were capable of. A nice botch when RVD tried to 5-star but fell. They edited out where the fan ran in and knocked Eddie off the ladder, which was hilarious. no more blurs. 9/10Undertaker Vs. Jeff HardyMY personal favorite 1on1 ladder match, and will go down as one of Jeff Hardy's greatest matches ever. this match had such a great story, and these 2 really put on an amazing show. Taker was a bit slow however, but it was a very nice match. Taker raised Jeff's hand afterwards, which was a mark out moment. 10/10TLC 4 (Kane Vs. RVD/Jeff Vs. Bubbah/Spike Vs. Jericho/Christian)I remember watching this episode of Raw, and can honestly be said to be the greatest Raw of all time. Not only did you get a cage match, a street ight, but then you got this match, another one of the TLC classics including only 3 originals, but that didn't take anything away from it. This was my second favorite TLC, and was full of nonstop action, and had some REALLY nice spots. 10/10.Chris Jericho Vs. Christian Unforgiven 2004I didn't really like this match. I love Christian, and I love Y2J, but this match just wasn't the best of them. It was slow, and didn't really have to many highlights. It was awesome when Christian had it won, but because jericho flipped ihm off, he got off the ladder. Not the best match from these 2. 6/10DISC 3:First EverMoney in the Bank Ladder Match (Benoit Vs. Jericho Vs. Edge Vs. Kane Vs. Shelton Benjamin Vs. Christian)This was an amazing match. I love all 6 of these superstars, and you got to see the best from all 6 of them. Shelton shined the brightest in this match, and really showed off what he can do. Why he hasn't had a ladder match for a title is beyond me. Best MitB match to date. 9.5/10Eddie Guerrero Vs. Rey Mysterio Summerslam 2005This match was great, but the storyline is what made it terrible.Too many stupid people got involved and ruined it, they did however make the best of this. It's worth watching, but if you remember the story line, you can get easily ticked. 7/10Edge Vs. Matt HardyThis was a nice nostalgia moment because of the past these 2 had, but this was nothing short of what the 2 can do. This match had some really nice ladder spots, including osme I've nerver seen before. A little bit too much interference form Lita, and Matt did really good still. a bit on the short side, but still a great match. 8/10TLC for the WWE title Ric Flair Vs. EdgeThis was on live TV? That amazes me, I was on a break form WWE at this time, so this match amazed me. Flair turned the clock back 20 years in this match, but thayt didn't stop me from cringing when he fell through a table of fell off the ladder. I thought he was goging to croak at any given moment. Too much Lita interference again. Great match for both stars. 9/10TLC match (John Cena Vs. Edge) Unforgiven 2006This is another one of my personal favorites. I hate Cena, but I love Edge. Both guys were really great in this match, minus Cena looking lost, and messing a few moves up. Edge made up for his stupidity. This match was amazing, and action packed. Wrong guy won though. 10/10Jeff Hardy Vs. Johnny NitroJeff Hardy has always been one of my favorite, and Nitro is one of my current favorites. These 2 did really great in this match, and it was nice seeing new blood go toe to toe with a Hardy in a ladder match. nitro brought out the best in Hardy. 8.5/10Fatal 4-way Ladder match for the WWE tag titles (Londrick Vs. Regal/Taylor Vs. MNM Vs. Hardy Boyz)I loved seeing the Hardyz and Londrick square off, they would make the best feud. Regal and Taylor brought this match WAY down. MNM looked pretty good in that match. This was a nice action packed match, not as good as the TLCs but still a very nice match. I was glad to see Londrick win. Mercury got a terrible injury from this match. 8.5/10This DVD is worth your money. Every match is worth watching, and some are worth watching many times, There were a few matches missing like Jeff Hardy Vs. RVD from Summerslam 2001 or Team Angle Vs. Eddie and Tajiri. It REALLY needed the triangle ladder match from WM 2000 and the ladder matc from WWX, but you still get a great listof matches. Why Todd Grisham hosted is beyond me. The blurring can be really annoying at times, but the action can hide it. If you notice, this was kinda a highlight of Edge's amazing career in WWE, from his tag days, to his midcard days, to his main eventing.Go out and buy this."],["3 Disc Widescreen Edition (2007)This DVD set is unfortunately hosted by Todd Grisham playing in character. Some of the superstars drop the act and try to play it straight when they drop in to talk - Shawn Michaels, Chris Benoit, Ric Flair...but others ham it up and stay true to their characters - Edge, Gregory Helms, Jeff Hardy, Kane, and the duo Joey Mercury & Johnny Nitro (You might know him now as John Morrison).The set starts off with one of the earliest known ladder matches - Jake Roberts vs. Big Daddy Ritter in 1979. It's for a bag of cash and is oddly anticlimactic but you have to give them credit since they were doing something new and didn't have a lot of ideas to go with yet. Then it moves on to Shawn Michaels who really paved the way for young superstars with this type of match and you get to see him vs. Bret Hart and then Razor Ramon.I enjoy listening to the old-school commentary with that old British guy, Jesse Ventura, and also Mr. McMahon in the days before taking off his mask and revealing himself to be Chairman of the Board. He's such a stiff and Ventura just blatantly criticizes him every chance he gets which makes him a fun color commentator. When Ventura hosted Raw, he went back on the mike and I really enjoyed that segment. You'll also get to hear the good ol' days of Jerry \"The King\" Lawler and good ol' J.R. teaming up on commentary. They really were the best team ever with information, attitude, and timing. Ever since J.R. left, it just hasn't been the same at the WWE, especially with that idiot Matt Striker at PPV events. He doesn't even get their names right some of the time. Also JBL will be on the mike towards the end of the set too which I always felt was his forte, he was a better color commentator than wrestler.There are several matches featuring Edge, Jeff Hardy, Matt Hardy, Christian, Chris Jericho, the Dudley Boyz, and Chris Benoit. Most of them are two on two and many of them feature two or four two-man teams all facing off at the same time. You can revisit the tag teams of New Brood, Dudley Boyz, Hardy Boyz, 3 Count, Jung Dragons, and Jamie Knoble & Evan Karagias. Not all are strictly ladder matches either, there are SIX TLC (Tables, Ladders, Chairs) matches including the first ever TLC match for the World Tag Team Championship at Summerslam 2000 with Dudley Boyz, Hardy Boyz, and Edge and Christian.I'm still waiting for when Edge and Christian reunite as a team or in a feud at present since ECW has been dissolved and Christian can now rumble with the peeps on Raw or Smackdown if he wants. I bet they're waiting till after Wrestlemania before going there and a lot will depend on who has a belt and if Christian gets to be Mr. Money-in-the-Bank.Edge has probably had more ladder matches than any other competitor in the WWE and has probably suffered more injuries and is prone to more injury than any other because of it. He goes on a tear about how these matches are career-shortening and that is easy to believe since they put so much pressure on the body. I saw Edge do a ladder match with Jeff Hardy at the Royal Rumble in Detroit in 2009 and they were jumping from the highest ladders onto the announce tables and breaking things. It is scary stuff!The more participants in the ring, the more dangerous and hard to keep track of it becomes. Chris Benoit could testify to that based on his match in a fatal four-way where one leap ended up shattering two discs in his neck, a very scary moment. Another even scarier moment in appearance is when a ladder hits Joey Mercury in the face shattering his nose and he ended up getting 25 stitches and losing 35% of the vision in his left eye. This is by far the most gruesome stunt in the collection.Other superstars featured in the collection are Triple H vs The Rock, The Undertaker vs. Jeff Hardy, Kane and the Hurricane on a team against three others, and Ric Flair against Edge. Triple H is super young and still getting called \"Hunter Hearst Helmsley.\" He is accompanied by Chyna and has a live DX band playing his entrance music which makes The Rock have to take even longer getting to the ring. I hear that The Rock will be hosting Raw sometime this summer so THAT should be something to look forward to since most of the time he seems to spend denying he was ever involved and becoming Disney's tool.The most disturbing storyline culminating in a match would be Eddie Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio over the custody of a child named Dominick. Of course it's a fake story, but it's just kind of weird and creepy to get the kid involved like that and have him at ringside looking like a little lost Oliver Twist.The most exciting match in the collection would be the \"Money In the Bank\" match at WrestleMania 21 in 2005 with Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho, Edge, Shelton Benjamin, Christian, and Kane. Shelton Benjamin really made a name for himself by showing off some major stunts and high-flying action, but Edge was the one to win!Here is the full run-down of matches so you know what to expect:Jake Roberts vs Big Daddy Ritter - 1979 Stampede WrestlingBret Hart vs Shawn Michaels - 1992 Intercontinental ChampionshipShawn Michaels vs Razor Ramon - 1995 SummerslamTriple H vs The Rock - 1998 SummerslamEdge & Christian vs New Brood - 1999 No MercyDudley Boyz vs Edge & Christian vs Hardy Boyz - 2000 Summerslam First TLC3 Count vs Jung Dragons vs Jamie Knoble & Evan Karagias - 2000 StarrcadeChris Benoit vs Chris Jericho - 2001 Royal RumbleEdge & Christian vs Dudley Boyz vs Hardy Boyz - 2001 WrestleMania 17 TLCEdge & Christian vs Dudley Boyz vs Hardy Boyz vs Chris Jericho & Chris Benoit - 2001 Fatal Four-way TLC for World Tag Team ChampionshipChristian vs Edge - 2001 No MercyEddie Guerrero vs Rob Van Dam - 2002 Intercontinental ChampionshipUndertaker vs Jeff Hardy - 2002 Undisputed WWE ChampionshipKane & The Hurricane vs Rob Van Dam & Jeff Hardy vs Dudley Boyz vs Chris Jericho & Christian - 2002 World Tag Team Championship TLCChris Jericho vs Christian - 2004 UnforgivenChris Benoit, Chris Jericho, Edge, Shelton Benjamin, Christian, Kane - 2005 First Money-in-the-Bank Match at WrestleMania 21Eddie Guerrero vs Rey Mysterio - 2005 SummerslamEdge vs Matt Hardy - 2005 Loser Leaves RawEdge vs Ric Flair - 2006 TLC WWE ChampionshipEdge vs John Cena - 2006 TLC UnforgivenJeff Hardy vs Johnny Nitro - 2006 Intercontinental ChampionshipPaul London & Brian Kendrick vs MNM vs Hardys vs William Regal & Dave Taylor - 2006 Armageddon"],["This set has some really great matches in it.

The ladder matches were shown in their entirety without cuts or editing.  However, sadly, it does not include what was, perhaps, the first ladder match in professional wrestling.  This occurred in 1962 when Ray \"Blond Bomber\" Stevens (also known as \"The Crippler\") went against Pepper Gomez at San Francisco's Cow Palace.  For this angle, Stevens delivered his vaunted Bombs Away knee drop from off the top of the ladder landing on Gomez's throat to win the match.  This was an electrifying moment for the fans which certainly helped to set the tenor for Stevens' dominance in the Bay Area as top heel during the entire 1960s decade.  The reason for not including this match in the set was probably due to no available film of the match in any archives, which I think is very sad."],["Well, I'm not much of a WWE fan but my 10 yr old son is.

Such as Eddie Guerrero vs X-Pac at NWO Souled Out (U.S title),  Chris Beniot vs Jeff Jarrett at Starcade (U.S Title) \"although we're lucky they didn't hold back the release of this dvd to take out the Beniot matches that are already on it\", The Money in the Bank Match that RVD won and the one that Kennedy won.Plus HBK's first Ladder match with Razor Ramon, both their Ladder matches could've been here since both are good. Goldberg also had a Ladder match with Scott Hall in WCW and that's not here either but I don't remember that one being too good. I remember Kurt Angle vs Chris Beniot in a Ladder match with the medals on the line but that might've been a 3 Stages of Hell match so that could be why it's on not here. But despite some matches missing this is a more sold WWE dvd than the WWE title match dvd. I hope they release a Vol 2 of the World Heavyweight Title History since a lot of good matches are missing and I'm not talking about John Cena matches \"snores\"."],["One of the most transcendent gimmick matches in sports entertainment is without a doubt the ladder match. What started out as a simple concept - the only way for a wrestler to win is to climb the ladder and get the prestigious concept - has become a genesis of some of the most memorable in-ring moments in professional wrestling history. Who could ever forget Shawn Michaels' frog splash off the ladder on Razor Ramon? or Jeff Hardy see-sawing the ladder into the faces of Matt Hardy and Christian? Or Shelton Benjamin using a ladder as a ramp to deliver a clothesline? Or a Dudley and a Hardy falling from a 20-foot ladder through a stack of four tables? This 3-disc DVD set includes some of the craziest, most spectacular and unforgettable ladder matches of all time, matches that redefined, revitalized and reinvented the concept of the \"ladder match\" to ensure its longevity for years to come.Quibbles over Todd Grisham's lackluster introductions (with several wrestlers making welcoming cameos) to these matches are understandable, but overall irrelevant. The question remains: do the matches themselves deliver? The answer is a resounding \"yes\". WWE really outdid themselves with this DVD set and their ingenious choice of matches. Sure, the set is missing a few treasures, but in the end, the quality of the product remains spectacularly high. Not only is \"WWE Ladder Match\" an exceptional introduction to the ladder match concept, but also one of the best wrestling DVD sets of all time.Ladder Match for North American Heavyweight Championship and CashJake Roberts vs. Big Daddy RitterStampede Wrestling, July 1979-We kick things off with this obscurity from Stampede Wrestling in late 1970s. And it's little wonder why it is. The match is extremely slow and lethargically paced. In fact, it looks like it was severely edited, missing a few opening minutes. Even worse, they use a one-sided ladder, which means that an official has to hold it down for a wrestler to climb. This match works as an historical curosity. Otherwise, take a pass. (*)Ladder Match for IC ChampionshipBret Hart vs. Shawn MichaelsJuly 21, 1992-Now we're getting somewhere. THIS, not the WMX match, was really the first ladder match in WWE history and it's a very good one. There are no devastating spots and very little unorthodox uses of the ladder as a weapon. It's basically a technical wrestling match with a ladder. Instead, the main drama is both men trying to grab the belt. Bret and Shawn are simply incapable of having a bad match and this match absolutely delivered in spades. Not one of both men's finest hours, but excellent overall. (****)Ladder Match for IC ChampionshipShawn Michaels vs. Razor RamonSummerSlam, August 27, 1995-As much as I love the WMX classic, I am so glad they included the SS1995 rematch here. Don't get me wrong. The original ladder match between HBK and Ramon is a masterpiece, but I love this match due to its amazing heat, emotional drama and brilliant psychology. The duration of the match is Ramon absolutely annihilating HBK's leg with the ladder, a tactic that Rock would perfect against HHH in the next match coming up. The only downside is the botched ending where HBK missed grabbing the belt a few times. Other than that, this match lived up to its hype and nearly equals the original. (****)Ladder Match for IC ChampionshipThe Rock vs. Hunter Hearst HelmsleySummerSlam, August 30, 1998-An unforgettable ladder match and a transcendent one for the participants involved. HHH and The Rock had a memorable feud throughout the summer of 1998 (who could forget DX's parody of the Nation?) and this would end it. And boy, did it ended it in style? This match is HHH and Rock beating the living daylights out of each other with the ladder, with the Rock particularly torturing HHH's leg. The monster pop that HHH got when nabbing the belt remains one of the most memorable of all time and he became a star. The Rock didn't do too bad either as afterwards, he became one of the company's biggest stars. Hell of a match and a hell of a way to end the feud, the first of many to come for both men. (****).Terri Invitational Tournament Ladder MatchEdge & Christian vs. New BroodNo Mercy, October 17, 1999-Oh yeah, baby. This match, the first ladder match in a tag team environment, kick-started one of the best tag team rivalries of all time and set the standard for ladder matches to come. Edge & Christian and the Hardyz (or the New Brood) were two athletic teams with a cult following before this match came along and turned them into stars. Some of the today's classic tag team spots originated from here, which included a leapfrog legdrop from Jeff off the ladder, powerbombs, reverse DDTs and neckbreaker off of it and the infamous see-saw spot. Even to this day, there is not an ounce of datedness to be found here. An absolute classic. (*****)Tables, Ladders and Chairs Match for the WWE Tag Team Championships:Dudley Boyz vs. Edge & Christian vs. Hardy BoyzSummerSlam, August 27, 2000-Unfortunately, this DVD set does not include groundbreaking triangle ladder match from WrestleMania 2000 here. Instead, we skip to the TLC match from SS2000, which may not be as influential, but is the overall better match. This match is just crazy as all the three teams destroyed themselves with vicious ladder/chair shots and sickening spots. Amongst the memorable spots include Jeff Hardy missing the swanton bomb off the 20-foot ladder and Bubba Ray going through a stack of four tables outside. The ending where Jeff and D'Von were hanging on the belts is just unforgettable. But alas, it was E&C; that walked away with the belts. I remember watching this as a kid and being incensed that the Hardyz didn't win the titles in their home state, but viewed today, this remains one of the pinnacles of the illustrious tag team division in the Attitude Era and it deservedly won numerous Match of the Year awards. Unquestionably, one of the best matches of all time. (*****).Ladder Match for a Contract for the Cruiserweight Championship:3 Count vs. Jung Dragons vs. Jamie Knoble & Evan KaragiasStarrcade, December 17, 2000.-This is from the dying days of WCW as the company was going down in flames before being bought in 2001. This was when the cruiserweights were taking stage after the departure of the Radicalz, mesmerizing fans with spectacular high-flying action. It's nice that they included a WCW match here and the match certainly delivers as a enthralling train wreck. The only downside is that the match is not as refined as the other WWE ladder matches, mostly due to the lack of booking at the time, as each spot seems more blatantly planned than tightly choreographed. But for anyone else who just doesn't care about in-ring storytelling and want to see human bodies fly in beautiful form, this match will whet your appetite. (***)Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Championship:Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho.Royal Rumble, January 21, 2001-Boy, do I feel depressed now. This is the first Chris Benoit match I've seen in 7 years, so you can already guess where my sentiments lie. This was the culmination of the Benoit/Jericho feud of 2000 as they were engaged in a series of great wrestling matches before they settled it in this brutal classic. There was no \"car crash\" spot or meticulous choreography; just an intense brawl between two guys beating the hell out of each other with ladders. These guys literally destroyed themselves as Benoit got a chair after an attempted tope and even missed a diving head butt off the top of the ladder. The match also marks the debut of the \"Walls of Jericho\" on the ladder and it looks very impressive even to this day. While this match may be hard to watch today given Benoit's actions, there's no denying that it remains as exciting today as it was back in 2001. (****)Tables, Ladders and Chairs II Match for the WWE Tag Team Championships:Edge & Christian vs. Dudley Boyz vs. Hardy BoyzWrestleMania X-Seven, April 1, 2001-Amazingly, this match was even better than the one from SummerSlam 2000. And get this? It wasn't even the best match of 2001. That shows you how good WWE was back in the day. There was so much craziness, so many sickening bumps throughout the match, as even the accomplices (Lita, Spike Dudley, Rhyno) got involved and were pulverized. The highlight of the match, without question, is Edge spearing Jeff Hardy from a 20-foot ladder. I remember watching it as a youngster and even I stood up and cheered when it happened. This match basically took all the positive aspects from the Tag Team, triangle and first TLC match and merge it together to become a grand spectacle of human carnage and destruction. Like you don't know what this gets. (*****).Tables, Ladders and Chairs III Match for the WWE Tag Team ChampionshipEdge & Christian vs. Dudley Boyz vs. Hardy Boyz vs. Chris Benoit & Chris JerichoSmackDown, May 24, 2001-Often overlooked for a variety of reasons (including, of course, Mr. Benoit himself), this match happened during a period when Benoit and Jericho were being pushed as main eventers against Steve Austin and Triple H. Unfortunately, that push was squandered due to HHH and Benoit's injuries, the latter caused by this match. While it may not be as frantic as the previous TLC matches, the match was more dramatically satisfying as Benoit was injured after going through a table and he and Jericho struggled to overcome many odds to keep the belt. Of course, there wouldn't be a TLC match without spots and there were an abundant, including Christian 3D off the ladder through a table and Jeff Hardy leapfrogging over a 20-foot ladder on Bubba Ray Dudley through an announcement table. This was, unfortunately, the last great ladder match from all three teams involved, as most of their subsequent matches as both singles and tag team competitors never came close to the magic they delivered in matches like this. (****).Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Championship:Christian vs. EdgeNo Mercy, October 21, 2001-Case in point, this match. That is not to say that this match was bad; in fact, it's very good. But there was no sense of astonishment that made the earlier ladder matches so special. Of course, this match is best known for two former partners going at it in a match that they helped define together as a team. It was a skillfully choreographed match, with both men make effective use of the ladder, but it needed a couple of epic spots to make it memorable. On the bright side, seeing Edge use the conchairto on his brother on the ladder made for a very satisfying end. (***).Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Championship:Eddie Guerrero vs. Rob Van DamRaw, May 27, 2002-Eddie Guerrero's triumphant return and battles with RVD were few highlights of an otherwise dismal year for WWE, particularly RAW. They had two previous encounters for the IC title before settling the score with this match on RAW. This match was a fast-paced, high-spot dazzler that showed that Eddie was back on top form after a year-long absence. Eddie and RVD literally beat the tar out of each other with the ladder, with Eddie performing a hilo, a tilt-a-whirl backbreaker and a sunset-flip power bomb and RVD performing his signature moves with it. The only flaw, like the HBK/Ramon match, was the ending, where it looked like RVD was going for a five-star off the ladder, but wound up falling. Otherwise, this was one of the best matches on WWE TV for the year. (****).Ladder Match for the Undisputed WWE Championship:Undertaker vs. Jeff HardyRaw, July 1, 2002-THIS, however, was NOT one of the best matches on WWE TV that year. I don't mean to sound like a contrarian, but I cannot understand the love that this match gets from fans. Jeff Hardy was a shell of his former self at the time and, as much as I love Undertaker, heel or face, I hated the American Bad A-- gimmick. This match was hyped as Jeff Hardy's once-in-a-lifetime shot at the Undertaker's WWE Championship and it sure looked like it. Even though the story was Jeff being the underdog, Taker treated him like a joke, where he had the match won a couple of times and chose to inflict more punishment and Jeff only performed one spot that was memorable, that being the somersault tope off the ladder on Taker. Of course, Taker wins and Jeff Hardy earns his respect. Unfortunately, this did nothing for Jeff Hardy's career at the time as he relinquished in midcard hell before being released in 2003. Sluggish and dull, with a couple of good spots (**)Tables, Ladders and Chairs Match for the WWE Tag Team Championships:Kane & the Hurricane vs. Rob Van Dam & Jeff Hardy vs. Bubba Ray Dudley & Spike Dudley vs. Chris Jericho & Christian.Raw, May 27, 2002-Just to show you how badly the WWE was doing in 2002: they promote Hurricane as a participant in the match and he doesn't even show up. So Kane has to go at it alone, taking on all the three teams without his partner. With the exception of that subplot, this match is basically a rehash of all the TLC matches, compressed in TV form. It's a fun match to watch, but there was little drama throughout the battle (only Kane's struggle to win on his own felt gripping) and the winner could be seen coming from a mile away. Thankfully, they ended showing the match just before HHH came out and accuse Kane of being a murderer, jumpstarting the reviled \"Katie Vick\" angle. Another interesting note: this was the match where Bubba Ray Dudley sustained such a nasty concussion that he completely forgot everything that happened in the match. (***)Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Championship:Christian vs. Chris JerichoUnforgiven, September 12, 2004.-When Edge suffered a groin injury in late 2004, he was forced to forfeit the Intercontinental belt. The contenders for the belt were Jericho and the returning Christian. Their shot at the IC title would be decided in a ladder match. This was by-the-books ladder match: good, but nothing special. Clearly, they were off their game that night as the pacing was all over the place and they rehashed most of the spots they've done in the past. But it was still a solid match and Jericho winning the Intercontinental title was a pleasant surprise. (***).Money in the Bank Ladder Match:Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho vs. Edge vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Christian vs. KaneWrestleMania 21, April 3, 2005-The first Money in the Bank ladder match and undoubtedly the best. Chaos abounded everywhere as all six men used the ladder to destroy one another. This was inspired chaos, the likes not seen since the TLC matches in 2001. I especially loved the way Kane was used here, as an indestructible force that could undermine everything. But the star of the match was Shelton Benjamin, who delivered two of the most memorable spots: the T-bone suplex off the ladder and the jaw-dropping running clothesline off the ladder on Jericho. Watching that for the first time left me in utter awe. Even to this day, I'm still amazed. Benoit's head butt off the ladder on Kane is also another highlight. But in the end, the victory went to Edge, getting the win of his career and starting his run as a bona fide main eventer. Absolutely fantastic. I'm glad they put this match on the set. (****).Ladder Match for Dominick's CustodyEddie Guerrero vs. Rey MysterioSummerSlam, August 21, 2005-How do you screw up a solid feud between two great athletes? By inserting a stupid storyline in it. That's exactly what happened to Eddie and Rey in the summer of 2005, as they no longer feuded over who the better wrestler was, but who would get custody of Rey's son Dominick. To be fair, a phenomenal ladder match between these two would make up for a laughable storyline, right? Unfortunately, the match was merely good. Rey and Eddie are incapable of having a lousy match and this wasn't one of them. But the storyline overtook the match, with Dominick and Vicki Guerrero interfering in the match. Nor did it help that it featured a botched sunset-flip bomb and a sloppy backdrop, which both stood out like sore thumbs. When Rey grabs the briefcase and dangles on the hook, one doesn't get the sense that they saw a great match, but that they're glad that the feud is over. (***).\"Loser Leaves Raw\" Ladder Match:Edge vs. Matt HardyRaw, October 3, 2005Speaking of feuds ending, we have this. Edge and Matt Hardy had an intensely personal feud throughout the summer, due to Lita having an affair with Edge, and this match would settle it The loser, of course, leaves RAW. This ladder match, as one reviewer pointed out, was more of a fight than a ladder match. But the ladder was used inventively by its participants, including one by Matt where he sandwiches the ladder on Edge (it could be seen on the DVD set when opened). Kendo sticks, chairs and a table were also involved, but Lita proved to be the ultimate factor as she prevented Matt from winning by tying him up around the ropes with her legs. Edge wins to become one of the WWE's biggest stars while Matt Hardy will be stuck in SmackDown midcard until his release in 2009. Very good TV match. (***).Tables, Ladders and Chairs Match for the WWE Championship:Edge vs. Ric FlairRaw, January 16, 2006-This was after Edge cashed in the Money in the Bank to become WWE Champion. This match was a change of pace from previous ladder matches as it was not an epic spotfest or a brutal brawl, but a classic story of a washed-up underdog going for one last shot against a younger, healthier champion. Despite reservations of Flair being in this environment, this was a fantastic match that told a great story and got the fans involved. There were moments when Flair really looked like he was going to win. There was even a moment when Flair took a suplex off the ladder and we felt that he was done for. Even though Edge won the match, Flair proved to the world that he was still the man. THIS was how the Jeff Hardy/Undertaker match should have been like. (****).Tables, Ladders and Chairs Match for the WWE Championship:John Cena vs. EdgeUnforgiven, September 17, 2006-Man, Edge is everywhere on this set. He and John Cena had a fantastic feud in 2006, which all came to a head at Unforgiven in Edge's hometown of Toronto, Ontario. The stipulation was that if Cena loses, he goes to SmackDown. Wow, is SmackDown really that bad of a show that going there is considered a form of punishment? Anyway, the TLC match rocked my socks off. Edge shows why he is the master of this environment, and no matter how you feel about John Cena, you cannot deny that he delivers the goods on PPV, which this match shows. Seeing Cena FU Edge off the ladder through two tables was truly a sight to see. It's not perfect; there are a few minor botches, such as failed sunset-flip bomb through a table and a weak chair shot by Cena, but overall, a tremendous effort by both men. (****)Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Championship:Jeff Hardy vs. Johnny NitroRaw, November 20, 2006-After a three-year long absence, Jeff Hardy made his return to the WWE, this time, in better form. As soon as he returned, he feuded with Johnny Nitro over the Intercontinental Championship. One of their best matches was the ladder match on Raw, the week before Survivor Series 2006. Even though Nitro has never been in a ladder match, watching this match, you would think he was in many beforehand. There was an onslaught of terrifically sick ladder spots, including a dropkick by Nitro off the ladder and Jeff missing the swanton bomb on Nitro and hitting the ladder instead. One of the most personal favorites is Nitro throwing a ladder at Jeff and his head being wrapped around the ladder. This match proved that Jeff Hardy was back with a vengeance and that Johnny Nitro was the future of the company. An underrated classic. (****)Fatal Four-Way Ladder Match for the WWE Tag Team ChampionshipsPaul London & Brian Kendrick vs. the Hardyz vs. MNM vs. William Regal & Dave Taylor-The last match on the set and a pure delight for ladder match fans of all ages. The match was originally scheduled to be London/Hendrick vs. Regal/Taylor in a normal tag team match, but to make a good match even better, Teddy Long makes it a fatal-four way ladder match which will also involve MNM and the Hardyz. And thank God cause this match is terrific. It's sloppy, messy and a complete utter trainwreck, but in a good way. There was non-stop action everywhere as bodies were literally thrown off the ladder onto the hard canvas. This match is, of course, notorious for the infamous sea-saw spot that destroyed Joey Mercury's nose and it's pretty sickening to watch. There's even a good dose of comedy in Regal/Taylor's fear of climbing ladders. Kendrick/London barely retain the belts in a hard-fought battle. What a great way to end this DVD set. (****)With multiple ****+ matches and not a single DUD in sight, this has to be one of the greatest wrestling DVD sets of all time. This set is so good that you won't notice there's anything else missing. Okay, there's the obligatory WMX classic and the triangle ladder match at WrestleMania 2000, but then there's also Christian vs. RVD on RAW September 2003, Edge & Christian vs. Hardyz on RAW September 2000, Rock vs. Mankind on RAW February 1999, RVD vs. Jeff Hardy in SummerSlam 2001, Syxx vs. Eddie Guerrero in Souled Out 1997 and the Money in the Bank matches in WrestleMania 22 and 23. But overall, that's very nit-picky.I cannot recommend this DVD set enough to all wrestling fans, particularly those that love ladder matches. As an introduction to the ladder match, it is sublime. As a collection of high-quality matches, it is absolutely superb.Strongest recommendation to buy immediately."],["Really sucks that Todd Grisham hosts this great DVD package as he just isn't very good, to say it nicely. His humor falls flat and his timing seems off, which could also be the fault of the writers for the DVD.-For fans who were hoping to see the Michaels v. Razor Wrestlemania X match will only get about a minute or so of clips, same goes for the Wrestlemania 16 Triangle Ladder Match between The Hardyz/Dudleyz/Edge & Christian, sucks about those two though. There are interviews done with Shawn Michaels, Jeff Hardy, Edge, Gregory Helms, Chris Benoit, Kane, Shelton Benjamin, Ric Flair, Johnny Nitro and Joey Mercury.-Stampede Wrestling '79 for the North American Heavyweight Title, Jake Roberts vs. Big Daddy Ritter (JYD): A bit of a shock here to say the least, not a very good one though. It's joined in progress about 5 mins. there's not very much action and what little is there is really dull. It's over shortly after that, with JYD winning the title. Like others have said watch once and forget it's one here. 3/10.-I.C. Title Match, Shawn Michaels vs. Bret Hart: From a house show in Portland, Maine, the very first WWF ladder match is a good technical bout, with very few uses of the ladder. Bret goes shoulder first into the ladder, Shawn gets slingshotted into the ladder in the corner. The finish comes when Bret dropkicks Shawn off of the ladder over the top rope and out of the ring, Bret then climbs the ladder and grabs the belt to retain the title. 7/10.-Summerslam '95, I.C. Title Match, Shawn Michaels vs. Razor Ramon (Champion): Once again not their Wrestlemania X match, but the Summerslam '95 rematch. Both wrestlers put on a great show with lots of good spots throughout including Shawn taking a vicious hit when Razor suplexes him to the outside and Shawn's ankle hits the guard rail. Also the ladder gets pushed and Shawn falls and honestly looks like he blew out his knee. But even after that there's about 10 more minutes of great back and forth action and the finish sees Shawn counter the Razor's Edge, sending Razor to the outside, Shawn tries to grab the belt but slips and sets the ladder back up and grabs the belt to win. 10/10.-Summerslam '98, I.C. Title Match, Rock (Champion) vs. HHH: Begins with the DX band playing Triple H along with Chyna to the ring and The Rock comes out with Mark Henry at his side. Some good spots include Rock continous working over of Hunter's knee, with a chair shot while Hunter's knee was wedged between a ladder. Also some great chair shots from Hunter to Rock, while Rock is under a ladder. The match itself is good, just not great but it does tell a good story of Triple H overcoming a heel Rock to end the Great One's title reign of almost 8 months. The finish comes when Chyna low blows the Rock and he falls off the ladder, which allows Triple H to climb the ladder and grab the belt for the win in. 8/10.-No Mercy '99, Terry Invitational Tournament Final, New Brood (The Hardy Boyz) vs. Edge & Christian: The finals of the Terri Invitational Tournament, figure out the double meaning with that one. Starts out a bit slow, which is to be expected. Both teams use the ladders in many different ways. The crowd was way into the match especially after Christian ran up a ladder and hit a dropkick on Jeff while he was in the corner. It stuns me that Jeff is not severely injured after some of the stuff he does, especially when he leapfrogs the ladder and hits a huge legdrop on Jeff. Also when he jumped off the top rope, hit another ladder into the faces of his brother and Christian, ouch I say. Finish comes when Matt knocks Christian and Jeff off of one ladder but Jeff lands on another ladder knocks Edge off and grabs the money at the top of the ladder for the win. 9/10.-Summerslam 2000, TLC I Match for the WWE Tag Team Championship, The Dudley Boyz vs. Edge & Christian (Champions) vs. The Hardy Boyz: The best of the TLC's cause it was the first, plenty of great spots throughout this one, Jeff does his usual insane Swanton from the top of a ladder but crashes and burns through a table. It seemed like the Hardy's were on their way to winning in their home state of North Carolina but Edge and Christian were able to pull out the win in the very first TLC match. 10/10.-Starrcade 2000, Shannon Moore & Shane Helms (Gregory Helms) vs. Jamie Noble & Evan Karagis vs. Kaz Hayashi & Jimmy Yang, winner gets a cruiserweight title shot: Great, great spotfest here, virtually nonstop action by all six men. Some of the spots include Helms hitting a huge swinging neckbreaker off a ladder, Karagis hitting a huge bodyslam off of a ladder. A sequence of flips and dives to the outside, by most of the competitors, that was very well paced. Helms and Moore both win when they pull down the contract, so both men receive a crusierweight title shot. 9/10.-Royal Rumble 2001, I.C. Title Match, Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit (Champion): This was a hell of a championship match, both men worked so well together whether it was as partners or as opponents. There were plenty of good spots, including Benoit doing a suicide dive but getting a vicious chair shot for his troubles. There was also good submission wrestling as Benoit worked on Jericho's arm, but he came back applying a submission on top of the ladder to Benoit. Jericho knocked the ladder over and Benoit hit the ropes and fell to the outside, Jericho climbed to the top and grabbed the title to become the new I.C. champion. 9/10.-Wrestlemania X-7, TLC II Match for the WWE Tag Team Championship, The Hardy Boyz vs. Edge & Christian vs. The Dudley Boyz (Champion): Not quite as good as TLC I, but still delivered the goods. Loved the insane spear from almost 15 feet in the air by Edge to Jeff while Jeff was hanging from the belts in mid-air. Rhyno, Spike Dudley and Lita all make appearances to help out their respective teams with all three getting some punishment, like Lita getting the 3D, Spike and Rhyno getting hit with a Swanton by Jeff off of a big ladder. The finish is great as Rhyno pushes a ladder with Matt and Bubba on top of it and they crash through 4 tables on the outside. Soon after Rhyno helps E&C; win the tag titles. 9/10.-May 2001, Smackdown, TLC III Match for the WWE Tag Team Championship, Chris Benoit & Chris Jericho vs. Edge & Christian (Champions) vs. The Dudley Boyz vs. The Hardy Boyz: Geeat TV main event as these four teams mesh well and during this match Benoit does a headbutt through a table on the outside that would lead to his neck surgery just a few months later. Each team gets some great spots in and this ends with Jericho and Benoit taking the tag titles to become the new tag champions. 9/10.-No Mercy 2001, I.C. Title Match, Edge vs Christian: For months there was tension building between the two brothers and it finally boiled over prior to this match as Christian was tired of living in his brothers shadow. This was more of a wrestling match with a ladder as they told a good story and did use the ladder in some good spots. Edge ends up taking this one which was expected and continued his singles push. 7/10.-May '02, Raw, I.C. Title Match, Rob Van Dam vs. Eddie Guerrero (Champion): Great match, lots of uses of the ladder, another one that's hard to describe, better to watch. Rolling Thunder by RVD onto Eddie under the ladder was awesome to watch. RVD hits a frog splash then climbs the ladder to win the I.C. Title. 10/10.-July '02, Raw, Undisupted Title Match, Undertaker (Champion) vs. Jeff Hardy: This was when they tried to give Jeff a singles push and this match was his best showing in my opinion. Jeff comes so close to beating Taker, but the Deadman (or Bad A.. well anyway, as he was here) did good as well since this was his first ladder match ever. Jeff gives it his all, hits som good chair shots and had his hands on the title before getting chokeslammed off of the ladder and Taker grabs the belt to win. 8/10, afterwards Jeff wouldn't stay down and kept calling Taker back to the ring and eventually he got his hand raised by Taker much to the shock of the announcers and Jeff.-October '02, TLC IV Match for the WWE Tag Team Championship: Kane & Hurricane (Champions) vs. RVD & Jeff Hardy vs. Bubba Ray & Spike Dudley vs. Jericho & Christian: Good one here that sees Kane shoulder the load for his team alone after Hurricane was taken out earlier in the night. There's some good spots, especially Jeff leaping off of a ladder smashing Kane through a table on the outside. However Kane would overcome all the odds to win the match and retain the tag titles. 7/10.-Unforgiven '04, I.C. Title Match, Chris Jericho vs. Christian (Champion): Like the Edge/Christian match on this set, this one told more of a story but still featured good spots including one wear Jericho ended up falling and hitting the ladder butt first which looked painful. It was a well done match for sure. 8/10.Shelton Benjamin vs. Chris Jericho vs. Edge vs. Christian vs. Chris Benoit vs. Kane: Money in the Bank Match-Wrestlemania 21: Good one here loved how Shelton ran up one ladder as it was laying sideways on another ladder and clotheslined Jericho who was at the top of the other ladder. Plenty of other great action as well.-Rey Mysterio vs. Eddie Guerrero-Summerslam '05 for custody of Dominick: I heard both men tore the house down with this match.-Edge vs. Matt Hardy-Raw Homecoming: Raw returns to the U.S.A. network and these two had a great match, plenty of good spots.-Edge vs. Ric Flair-Raw January 06 for the WWE Title: Great showing by both men, but especially Flair, who proved he can still deliver in the main event even at his age.-Unforgiven '06, Match for the WWE Championship, Edge (Champion) vs. John Cena: Great main event and the match of the night. Continious major league pop for Edge as this is his hometown and even bigger heat for Cena, not as bad as One Night Stand from June though. The match is really good, especially considering it's Cena wrestling. Liked the early boos directed at Cena everytime he hits an offensive move on Edge. Cena does do good in this match actually, even FU'ing a ladder onto Edge and locking the STFU on Edge while Edge was trapped between the ladder. Edge has some great offense too as can be expected because he's been in plenty of these matches and he's only lost one TLC match, which was on Smackdown in Spring of '01. Lots of great uses of the hardware surrounding the ring. Lita comes in and pushes over the ladder with Cena on it, and he falls out of the ring through a table. However when she tries to help Edge again, she hits Cena with a chair and causes him to bump Edge off the ladder through two table laying outside the ring. Cena then FU's Lita and begins to climb the ladder. Great finish with Cena catching Edge and FU'ing him off the ladder through two tables and then grabs the belt for the win in about 25 minutes. 10/10. Cena didn't look too happy afterwards about what he did to Edge.-Jeff Hardy vs. Johnny Nitro-Raw November '06 for the I.C. Title: Good one actually, shocked Nitro did so well in a ladder match considering he was only on the main roster for just over a year at this time. Good amount of high spots, grounding by both men using the ladder to take the legs away of their opponent. Jeff ends up grabbing the title to retain and win the match. 8/10.-The Hardys vs. MNM vs. London & Kendrick vs. William Regal & Dave Taylor: Four Team Ladder Match-Armageddon '06: Whoa I mean, whoa, I cringe everytime I see Joey Mercury get his face busted open and his nose broken, when a ladder gets smashed into his face. Nitro on his own does well in the match and there's some funny moments with Taylor and Regal being afraid of heights and unwilling to climb the ladder when they had the chance. Also liked the exchanges between The Hardy's and London & Kendrick, it ends with Kendrick and London retrieving the titles in the blink of an eye to retain in this great hard hitting ladder bout. 9/10.-On a side note I'm a little disappointed the TNN debut match with The Hardyz vs. Edge & Christian was left off as well as the RVD vs. Christian match from Raw '03, both were great matches and worth putting on the DVD, but otherwise its a good set to have in your collection"],["One of the best WWE dvds I ever saw. My Favorite ladder match on this disc set is the one from WCW Starrcade 2000.I hope they come up with \"Ladder Match 2\". All the matches were good and had solid wrestling. I give this set a 9 out of 10."],["This three disc dvd set features a good combination of matches from the bret  hart days to today. Despite the good variety of ladder matches, most wwe fans may not feel the need to really purchase this disc set since they probably already have most of the matches in this set. However, it is good to have a set with all the ladder matches together and to take a look back at wrestlers such as edge, the hardys, and hbk whose careers rose to superstar and ( in the case of shawn michaels ) even legendary status due in large part to the ladder match. This is a good disc set that any wrestling fan should check out."],["My son loves this DVD.  I'm glad Amazon had it, we could not find it in the stores, great low price too!"],["I have been a wrestling fan since 1996 and have watched all kinds of wrestling. I have a wrestling DVD/VHS collection spanning over 50 all together. This is the most complete and accurate review of this DVD you will find. I hope you find this review helpful; remember to vote helpful or not helpful. (Note-Each DVD I review has a \"Match of the DVD\" award somewhere in it.)WWE- The Ladder MatchThe Ladder Match. It is one of the most violent, most entertaining, and most high-risk matches in WWE history. WWE has given us this gift of 22 amazing Ladder Matches in this 3-Disk set. Todd Grisham hosts this set, and he does a great job of being a geek that is entertaining. Some people complain because this set lacks the Triangle Ladder Match fromWWE WrestleMania April 2, 2000and Shawn/Razor fromWWE WrestleMania X - 10 Years In The Making, but I like the fact that they gave us some of the lesser know Ladder Match instead of those two. If you are a wrestling fan this needs to be in your collection. This not only shows the evolution of the Ladder Match, but the evolution of WWE as a whole.-Disc 1-Ladder Match (Stampede Wrestling- July 1979)North American Heavyweight Championship & CashJake Roberts VS Big Daddy RitterThis is one of the very early Ladder Matches from Stampede Wrestling. The match is joined in progress. It's worth a watch once, but after that you won't watch it again.RATING- 4/10Ladder Match (July 21, 1992)Intercontinental ChampionshipBret Hart(c) VS Shawn MichaelsThis match was another early Ladder Match; this time the match was a WWF match. The match isn't horrible, but it's another match you'll only watch once.RATING- 6/10Ladder Match (Summerslam 1995)Intercontinental ChampionshipShawn Michaels(c) VS Razor RamonThis was the rematch from their classicWWE WrestleMania X - 10 Years In The MakingLadder match. Both men work really hard to pull off a great match. Shawn Michaels takes a terrible bump when he is suplexed off the ring and his ankle hits the guardrail. The reason why the score is only 8.5 is because the ending is severely screwed up. Michaels attempts to grab the belt 3 in a row before being successful.RATING- 8.5/10Ladder Match (Summerslam 1998)Intercontinental ChampionshipTriple H VS The Rock(c)This is one of my favorite Ladder Matches. It's funny to think that a few short months later The Rock would be WWF Champion and about a year later Triple H would be WWF Champion. Both men put on a show filled with great, new spots. The Rock even delivers a People's Elbow to Triple H while he's on the Ladder. This match can't get a perfect score due to the ending.RATING- 9.5/10Terri Invitational Tournament- Ladder Match (No Mercy 1999)Edge & Christian VS New Brood (Jeff and Matt Hardy)If you've ever seen any of their other Ladder matches, this will disappoint you. This was more like a sample of what you would get later on. You see all your regular Hardy moves and that's about it. Also, for most of the match, they don't even seem to care about getting the money hanging above the ring, but instead just want to do crazy moves. Still, it's cool to see the Hardys pulling off some of their early moves in this match.RATING- 7.5/10Tables, Ladders, and Chairs Match (Summerslam 2000)World Tag Team ChampionshipsDudley Boyz VS Edge & Christian(c) VS Hardy BoyzNow, this was a big step up from the last match. The Dudleys are what really bring this match together. I'm not saying they are the best, but if they weren't in it, it would be exactly like the No Mercy match. Lots of awesome spots and tons of broken tables, that's what you can expect. Bubba, Matt, and Jeff all take huge Ladder to Table spots near the end. Edge and Christian sneak in the back door to pick up the victory.RATING- 9/10Triple Ladder Match (WCW Starrcade 2000) (Match of the DVD)Contract for WCW Cruiserweight Championship Match3 Count VS Jung Dragons VS Jamie Knoble & Evan KaragiasWhat the ****? That's right WCW is in the house. Now, this is from the end of 2000, just a few short months before WCW died. So, you expect crap right? No. This match is one of the greatest Ladder Matches of all time. You see many innovative spots that you'll never see in WWE. They even stack the ladders like a scaffold and do moves off of it. Also, even though this is a tag team match, there can be only one winner. Which adds to the interesting nature of things.RATING- 10/10Ladder Match (Royal Rumble 2001)Intercontinental ChampionshipChris Benoit(c) VS Chris JerichoThe Benoit/Jericho rivalry erupts into a Ladder Match. This was a well-paced match; I just felt it lacked something great. Benoit gets smashed in the face by a steel chair while try to dive onto Jericho. There are just too many \"I push you off the ladder and you fall out the ring\" spots.RATING- 8/10-Disc 2-TLC 2 (Wrestlemania X7)Edge & Christian VS Dudley Boyz(c) VS Hardy BoyzThese 3 teams put on the perfect match. They have really worked out the kinks from the original TLC match and fixed it here. Edge does the insane spear on Hardy while he is hanging from the belts spot that you see in millions of highlight videos. Rhyno, Spike Dudley, and Lita all make appearances and have their own spots.RATING- 10/10Fatal Four-Way TLC 3 (Smackdown, May 24, 2001)World Tag Team ChampionshipsEdge & Christian VS Chris Jericho & Chris Benoit(c) VS Hardy Boyz VS Dudley BoyzThis is often called the forgotten TLC match due to the fact that Edge lost this TLC match, despite Edge claiming he's never lost a TLC Match. Benoit and Jericho make this TLC different than the previous two by bringing their styles to this match. There are a lot of different spots then the other TLC matches, which means you won't feel like this is the same match you've already seen. Benoit gets injured pretty badly.RATING- 9/10Ladder Match (No Mercy 2001)Intercontinental ChampionshipChristian(c) VS EdgeWell, the amazing team couldn't last forever. Both Edge and Christian pursue singles careers instead of staying a tag team. The match is significantly slower than all of the other matches so far, but it's still got its strong points. The ending is really well done.RATING- 8/10Ladder Match (Raw, May 27, 2002)Intercontinental ChampionshipEddie Guerrero(c) VS Rob Van DamI really enjoyed this match. A good portion of the match is not focused on the later, but they build up the match before bringing it into the ring. RVD plummets from the ladder when he stumbles trying to do a frog splash. Great match, especially for Raw. Chris Benoit makes an appearance.RATING- 8.5/10Ladder Match (Raw, July 1, 2002)Undisputed WWE ChampionshipUndertaker(c) VS Jeff HardyI don't understand why some people consider this an amazing match. This was a good, solid match, but it lacked a lot of action. I will admit that it had a lot of emotion wrapped into it. I was just expecting more spots and Hardy to not be beat down most of HIS match.RATING- 7.5/10TLC 4 (Raw, October 7, 2002)World Tag Team ChampionshipsKane(c) VS Rob Van Dam & Jeff Hardy VS Bubba Ray & Spike Dudley VS Jericho & ChristianKane is Tag Team Champions with Hurricane Helms, but Triple H attacked Hurricane earlier in the night so Kane is on his own. The match didn't live up to the other great TLC matches, but it was still fun to watch. The action seemed random and didn't draw enough emotion.RATING- 8/10Ladder Match (Unforgiven 2004)Intercontinental ChampionshipChris Jericho VS ChristianAfter Edge was forced to vacate the title due to injury, a new champion must be decided. The match itself wasn't all that great. The pacing seemed very off and there weren't any really good spots to cover that up.RATING- 7/10-Disc 3-Money in the Bank Ladder Match (Wrestlemania 21)Chris Benoit VS Chris Jericho VS Edge VS Shelton Benjamin VS Christian VS KaneNow this was an awesome way to start out the final disk. The winner would receive a title shot at anytime of his choosing anytime over the next year. All men put on a great effort in this spot filled match. Shelton Benjamin really puts on a show you have to see to believe.RATING- 9/10Ladder Match (Summerslam 2005)Custody of DominickEddie Guerrero VS Rey MysterioSeeing as you won't have to actually watch the long, drawn out, ridiculous story line on TV, you will not hate this match as much as everyone else. This ladder match was different and contained spots that you've never seen before, including a sick backdrop from the ladder onto another ladder that was propped up on it.RATING- 9/10Ladder Match (Raw, October 3, 2005)Loser Leaves Raw/Money in the BankEdge VS Matt HardyThis was a strong match from Raw with a very real storyline behind it. The loser had to leave Raw, but the winner would get the MITB. Some good spots but this can't top the two previous matches.RATING- 8/10TLC 5 (Raw, January 16, 2006)WWE ChampionshipEdge(c) VS Ric FlairFour years after the last TLC takes place we get our first singles TLC match. No one expected Ric Flair to win this match considering Edge had just won the title, but Flair made us believe through the course of this match. Flair takes a ton of punishment and almost pulls it off.RATING- 8/10TLC 6 (Unforgiven 2006)WWE ChampionshipJohn Cena VS Edge(c)Cena is in yet another hostile environment, much like he was atECW: One Night Stand. They are in Edge's hometown and in Edge's match. Good pacing and a strong amount of spots. Cena screws up a sunset flip, but we can't be too hard on him.RATING- 8.5/10Ladder Match (Raw, November 20, 2006)Intercontinental ChampionshipJeff Hardy(c) VS Johnny NitroA very good Raw match that put Johnny Nitro on the map for many people. Nitro hits an amazing dropkick to Hardy while both are on the Ladder. Good match, worth a watch.RATING- 8/10Fatal Four-Way Ladder Match (Armageddon 2006)WWE Tag Team ChampionshipPaul London & Brian Kendrick(c) VS MNM VS Hardys VS William Regal & Dave TaylorTo close the DVD, they give you the brutal Ladder match from Armageddon. The match is really just a cluster until Joey Mercury gets his nose broken and is rushed to the hospital. It is really a brutal shot that you have to see to believe. After that the match picks up and you see some really good spots.RATING- 9/10"],["Every time I watch a WWE DVD I get the feeling that something's missing. \"If only this match or that match were on here.\" It's always debatable what should be on a DVD. Not with this one. I got it, watching it right now, love it. Period. Name a big name and he's likely on here: Undertaker (I forgot he had a ladder match, but let's face it, it was to spotlight JHardy), HBK, RVD, The Rabid Wolverine, The Rock, Triple H, Bret Hart, the usual Ladder suspects (Edge & Christian, The Hardys, the Dudleys) and my main man Chris Jericho (since WWE did nothing as far as a DVD to highlight his career antics since the \"Break Down The Walls\" VHS, I have to find him where I can. It's always good to see ol' Y2J).I really don't know how else to say that this is a DVD worth the money. I'm rebuilding my wrestling DVD collection and this is definitely a main eventer here. AND I'M NOT EVEN DONE WATCHING THE FIRST DISC.The segments with Todd Grisham were cool. He spoke with Shawn Michaels, Edge, Jeff Hardy, etc. The way they were done were not over the top; I got the impression that WWE wanted the matches to speak for themselves and the commentary and appearances were to enhance the experience as opposed to the usual \"hey, look it's me, now buy the DVD since I'm on it with my catch phrase.\"Another thing was that the WrestleMania ladder matches were referred to, but not shown in their entirety. I guess WWE caught on that fans are only gonna buy they same repackaged stuff for so long. I didn't even know that HBK and Razor Ramon had a second ladder match. These are the matches that need to be shown.I'm done. Time to pop in disc two."],["Professional Wrestling is good on TV but the problem is all the filler.With DVD you Hurst get the action and most of it is good.Here you see a lot of high risk moves and daring acrobatics.Wrestling does gave it's real moments. Like on this one where Jeff knocks Joey Mercury in the face and he shoots out a fountain of blood!This one is a definite buy!"],["80-76%-perfect75-71%-awsome70-66%-good65-61%-poor60-56%-awful1. Jake Roberts vs. Big Daddy Ritter Ladder Match For The North American Heavywieght Championship and cash- Now I am not going to rip this match real bad but I will say it is not very good. We do not get to see the first 6 minutes of action as they already go halfway into the match. This was just to slow and the commentating and the type of ladder match just made it different and for me it was hard to enjoy. This was the first ever ladder match so I can understand why its on here so it is worth a wacth but besides that u can skip it. Winner Jake Roberts. Match Rating 2/10.2. Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels Ladder Match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship- Now this is were the dvd picks up. This was a lot better of a ladder match than the first one. This ladder match did not see so many crazy spots as there was a lot of technical wrestling. There were some nice spots but nothing to crazy like you will see today. Not a lot to say but you can never expect a match between hart and Michaels to be bad. Winner and new WWF Intercontinental Champ Bret Hart. Match Rating 8/10.3. Shawn Michaels vs. Razor Ramon Ladder Match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship- I was able to see there match at wrestlemania and that blew me away but this match right here was even better than that. This was given a good half hour and these two produced a classic match. There were tons of high flying action in this match and just a lot of sweet spots to remember forever. Great match. Winner and new WWF Intercontinental Champ Shawn Michaels. Match Rating 10/10.4. HHH vs. The Rock WWF Ladder match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship- This was another very solid match. These two had a very nice feud going into this match and this one topped it all off. A lot of wrestling and some nice spots of the ladder including a suplex off it. It looked like HHH was going to lose when the rock through powder in t his eyes but Chyna low blowed the rock and he fell off the ladder. Winner and new WWF Intercontinental Champ HHH. Match Rating 8/10.5. Edge and Christian vs. New Brood Terri Invitational Tournament Ladder Match- This was the first time these two teams met off in a ladder match. This match right here really changed the way the ladder match was. There was a lot of high flying action in this match. There were some nice spots including a spear from ladder to ladder. Very good match forthese teams. Winners New Brood. Match Rating 8/10.6. Dudley Boyz vs. Edge and Christian vs. The Hardy Boyz First Ever TLC Match for the World Tag Team Championship- Now about a year later these teams met but this time the dudleys were added to the match. This match was absolutely off the chart. There were so many sick parts in this match. There were tons of vicious chair shots including a sick one to bubba Dudley. Another sweet part in the match was when Jeff Hardy tried a swanton bomb off a top of a 15 foot ladder but crashed through two tables below. Also Matt was about to grab the titles but was pushed backwards off a 15 foot ladder through a table. Awesome match. Winners and still World Tag Team Champs Edge and Christian. Match Rating 9.5/10.7. 3 Count vs. Jung Dragons vs. Jamie Knoble and Evan Karhias Ladder Match for a Contract for the WCW Cruiserweight Championship- Now this was interesting as this added WCW into the Ladder Match DVD and this match did not disappoint. Now this one was a little different because it involved cruiserweight. This match was non stop high flying action and I will let you check this match out to see for yourself. Winners 3 Count. Match Rating 9/10.8. Chris Beniot vs. Chris Jericho Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Title- Now this was another great ladder match. This was just some hard hitting action. There were tons of nice spots including lots of suplexs on the ladders. Some good solid action but the best part was when Jericho locked in the walls of Jericho on the ladder. Winner and new WWF Intercontinental  Champ Chris Jericho. Match Rating 9/10.9. Edge and Christian vs. Dudley Boyz vs. The Hardy Boyz TLC Match for the World Tag Team Championships- Now I thought that there match at Summerslam 2000 was off the chain this one believe it or not is even better. Anyway there were just some nice spots including when Jeff Hardy Hit a Swanton bomb off the top of the ladder and put Rhino and Spike through a table. One of the sickest spots you will ever see in wrestling is when Edge hit Jeff Hardy with a spear off a 20 foot ladder. Also at the end Matt and Bubba got pushed off the top of the ladder through 4 tables. Winners and new World Tag Team Champs Edge and Christian. Match Rating 10/10.10. Edge and Christian vs. The Hardy Boyz vs. The Dudley Boyz vs. Chris Beniot and Chris Jericho Fatal Four Way TLC Match for the World Tag Team Championships- Here yet again is another TLC match and even this one did not disappoint. The only downfall of having this on tv is we did not get to see the whole match but we got to see all the sick spots. This was also the first time 4 teams competed in a TLC match. Lots of good action here but the best part is when Jeff Hardy put a ladder between two tables and jumped over it and hit a leg drop on bubba that put him through the table. Winners and still World Tag Team Champs Chris Beniot and Chris Jericho. Match Rating 9/10.11. Edge vs. Christian Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Championship- This was a decent ladder match but a step down from what I was expecting. I was hoping for a 5 star match cause of how many matches they have been in it was still good but could have been better. There were some nice spots in this match including a reverse ddt off a ladder. At the end of the match Edge hit a sick conchairto on the top of the ladder. Winner and new Intercontinental Champ Edge. Match Rating 8/10.12. Eddie Guerrero vs. RVD Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Championship- This was another solid match and this type of match really worked well in RVD's favor. This just involved a lot of high flying action but also Eddie worked on RVD's leg a lot as there were tons of chair shots to the leg and the back of rvd. There were some nice moves including a rolling htunder attempt on the ladder but that missed. Rvd hit a splash off the top of the ladder which was sweet. Nice match. Winner and new Intercontinental Champ RVD. Match Rating 8.5/10.13. Undertaker vs. Jeff Hardy Ladder Match for the Undisputed WWE Championship- Now this was a little bit different. The match itself was solid. The match was supposed to be Hardy begin the underdog and would not give up no matter how much punishment he took. Nice match a lot controlled by taker. A sick chockslam off the top of the ladder was sweet. Winner and still Undisputed WWE Champ Undertaker. Match Rating 7.5/10.14. Kane and The Hurricane vs. RVD and Jeff Hardy vs. Bubba Ray Dudley and Spike Dudley vs. Chirs Jericho and Christian TLC Match for the World Tag Team Titles- This was another nice TLC match and the second one ever on tv and featured 4 teams. This match was very well paced there were some nice spots including a leg drop off a ladder by Jeff Hardy that put Kane through a table. Rvd also hit a sick Van terminator from corner to corner. Winners and still World Tag Team Champs Kane and The Hurricane. Match Rating 9/10.15. Chris Jericho vs. Christian Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Championship- This was a decent ladder match. Nothing new that we haven't seen before. For me I was not all that impressed by this match that might be just me not great but worth a look. Winner and new Intercontinental Champ Chris Jericho. Match Rating 7.5/10.16. Chris Beniot vs. Chris Jericho vs. Edge vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Christian vs. Kane First Ever Money in the Bank Ladder Match- Now this was a great match to kick off the third disk. From the start I could tell this was going to be a good match. There were lots of nice moves including a T-Bone suplex off the top of the ladder. Also in the match Shelton hit a running clothesline running up the ladders one of the sickest things you will ever see. Also a nice head but off the top of the ladder from Chris Beniot. Winner Edge. Match Rating 9/10.17. Eddie Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio Ladder Match for the Custody of Dominick- This was yet another solid match. This also told a good story that if rey lost he would ose custody of his son domincik to eddie. There were just some nice moves including a backdrop off the top of the ladder onto another ladder. Also the 3 amigos suplex on the ladder good fast pace action and you will enjoy this one. Winner Rey mysterio. Match Rating 8.5/10.18. Edge vs. Matt Hardy Loser Leaves Raw Ladder Match- Now this was a different type of ladder match. These two also had a feud going for a lot of months over edge stealing lita. Usually when you have a ladder match unless it's a tlc match you will not see a lot of other weapons. This one had tables chairs and Kendo sticks. There were some nice spots in the match including a diving crossbody on Hardy through the table. Some nice Kendo stick shots as well. Decent match for tv. Winner Edge. Match Rating 7.5/10.19. Edge vs. Rick Flair TLC Match for the WWE Championship- Now this match was off the chain for tv. I would have never thought in my life that rick flair would be in a TLC match and that it would be accualty good. This match had a lot of sick spots including a body splash off the top of the ladder from in the ring to the outside of the ring thorugh a table. Also inside the ring EDGE got backdropped off the ladder and went through the table. A sick suplex off the ladder on flair as well. Winner and still WWE Champ Edge. Match Rating 8.5/10.20. John Cena vs. Edge TLC Match for the WWE Championship- This was yet another good match. These two have also had a feud on and off throughout the year. Great match here and the crowd was all behind edge and cena got booed out the bulding which adds to the match. Just some great spots that I will let you see but u have to check this out. Winner and new wwe champ John Cena. Match Rating 9/10.21. Jeff Hardy vs. Jonny Nitro Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Championship- This was a decent raw match. I think if you check it out you will like it as it is a very fast paced match and lots of high flying action thanks to jeff hardy. Winner and new Intercontinental Champ Jeff Hardy. Match Rating 8/10.22. Paul London and Brian Kendrick vs. MNM vs. The Hardy Boyz vs. William Regal and Dave Taylor for the WWE TAG TEAM TITLES- This match was supposed to be Paul London and Brian Kendrick vs. Dave Taylor and William Regal in a normal match but it turned out to be 10 times better. This match was all over the place non stop action. In this match you will see one of the sickest shots to the face ever in your whole life on Joey Murcery of MNM it is sick. Winners and still WWE Tag Team Champs Paul London and Brian Kendrick. Match Rating 8.5/10.Well that raps up another. I would give the History of the Ladder Match a grade of 182/220 which is a 83% which means this is a perfect dvd. I really cant stress it enough that anyone that likes wrestling and the ladder match needs to pick up this dvd cause you cant lose. It is better than the history of the wwe title and I think if you don't watch it all at once you will like it more cause it could get boring. A great dvd pick it up and if you can tell me if my review was helpful or not I would appreciate. Thanks for your time."],["This dvd has the best matches. The price very reasonable and great. I love how you guys made arrive on valentines day"],["If you're into omg moments, classic WWE memories, an overload of worth your buck matches, and over the top entertaining wrestling then this purchase is for. Main reason I bought this movie was because I discovered it featured my favorite match of all time. BENOIT & JERICHO VS THE DUDLEYS VS THE HARDYS VS EDGE & CHRISTIAN TLC 3. To be able to relive this match back when randomly one Friday watching smackdown with my friends back in 2001 with our jaws dropped to the floor made this purchase mean much more. From shawn vs ramon to rvd vs Eddie you will never regret buying this. I give this dvd nothing but a high recommendation."],["Hearing of this release a few months back, I was skeptical.  I know that since WWE acquired WCW and ECW, it has only shown a small dose of what they have to offer.  The ECW DVD's are the greatest example with great matches, but still lacking.  I buy this on the hope it's great, given it's advertised with great matches.  The first match on it sucks, but I think they put it there to show how it evolved from a crappy match with Junkyard Dog and Jake Roberts all the way to main event status for The Hardys, Dudles, Edge/Christian and even Jericho.  So far, I'm only half way into watching it, but so far, the best match on here is the only WCW one with 'Shane' Helms and Shannon Moore (even has a young Jamie Noble and Jimmy Wang Yang).  This DVD is by far the best compilation DVD that WWE has released to date.  A must buy for those fans who can handle the hardcore, brutal and ruthless matches it offers."],["This video was bought for my grandson who is a huge Wrestling fan.  He sayshe enjoyed every minute.  Wish I could expand more, but I have not seenthe video.  As long as my grandson is happy, then so am I."],["I don't think I need to bore you with another review of each match, there is enough to read around here already.What I will say is that this focus' on only WWF/E matches, and one WCW match.  The WCW did have some great matches with Rey Mysterio and Billy Kidman which arenot anywhere to be seen here. They may not have been the best ladder matches of all time, but they where a lot better then the Undertaker VS Jeff Hardy match that has been included in this collection, which apart from the ladder being in the middle of the ring, it was hardly a great \"ladder\" match.Also missing are the extreme ladder matches from the old ECW days. Perhaps Terry Funk pushing cactus jack off a ladder into a barbwire rope barricade and landmines was considered to violent for a WWE release? I think we would have enjoyed that match being included wouldn't we?And I do not see why they did not include the first HBK vs Razor Ramon ladder match. It may not have been the first ever ladder match, but it's the match that really innovated the ladder match into the WWF, you only see a couple of highlights from it before the rematch they had that is shown on this dvd.so, with matches missing, it can't be the perfect 5 star release.Overall, the TLC matches are all included here, they are worth the price of purchase alone."],["This is, without a doubt, one of the best WWE videos I've ever owned, and I've been buying them since 1990!  Every match is shown in it's entirety, including wrestler entrances.  You'll get to see old school classics like HBK vs Bret Hart from July 1992, HBK vs Razor Ramon (Scott Hall) at SummerSlam 1995, and Rock vs Triple H at SummerSlam 1998.You also get some of the best TLC matches with Edge & Christian, The Dudleyz, and The Hardyz.  They even included recent matches like the first Money in the Bank from Wrestlemania 21 and Edge vs John Cena at Unforgiven 2006.So they basically included every classic ladder match from the mid-70's to the present time, except for matches that we've all seen a million times (like HBK vs Razor Ramon from Wrestlemania 10).  I think there are 21 total matches.  This video is less than $20 but I probably would have paid triple that amount, because the quality of the matches on this DVD is simply outstanding.  THIS IS A MUST BUY FOR EVERY WWE FAN - GET IT NOW!!!"],["This set includes a vast array of ladder matches...I'd strongly recommend this set for those, like me, that want DVD quality of rare matches (like the HBK vs. Bret Hart ladder match; previously only available on tape)...This set is dynamic in that it shows a different side of wrestling,evolving it along the way, and how that side itself has evolved...compare matches from the beginning of the set (i.e. - Hart vs. HBK) to more recent ones like Nitro vs. Hardy.  Whereas in the past the ladder was just used as a gimmick and the matches were effectively a normal wrestling match with the rare ladder spot, nowadays the match itself is competition to upstage a previous ladder match (some times more wrestling occurs on the ladder than in the ring)...To those complaining about certain matches lacking the reason is simple:  WWE has released many of those matches multiple times on DVD (HBK vs. Ramon from Wrestlemania X for example)...if you want those matches, look for them on other sets (Wrestlemania Anthology and HBK's Inside the Vault)...other's were truly that good (most ECW ladder matches were garbage matches...with a ladder thrown in)...This, along with the steel cage DVD set \"Bloodbath\" truly shows how WWE can put forth an AMAZING collection of themed matches...A big recommendation to order it..."],["This is a great compilation of @ 20 great matches. Though I will never understand why they decided to show only clips of Shawn Michaels and Razor Ramon's first classic ladder match, all the other matches are shown in their entirety. The only other match that had clips was the ladder match from WrestleMania 2000. Which is okay, because all the high risk spots are done in the other matches anyway. Great DVD."],["Was very happy with my purchase, was delivered quickly and my grandson is perfectly happy! Thank you If my grandson is happy I am happy! :)"],["An Awesome, action-packed DVD that covers every great ladder match of the last 20 years!

Also, the interviews for the upcoming match usually ruin the ending for the match you wanna watch. Really annoyed."],["I loved seeing the very first ladder match, before WWE adopted it. The matches were exciting. The cast of wrestlers included some classic names from the past. Audio & video quality are excellent.I love this stuff! My goal is to eventually buy all the wrestling videos Amazon offers."],["The Ladder Match over the years has produced many, many heart stopping and breath taking moments throughout Professional Wrestling's history. WWE did an awesome and wonderful job picking out some of the most tremendous and show stealing Ladder Matches that has ever been.This three disc set is hosted by Todd Grisham and throughout the presentation you will hear from susperstars commenting on their experiences and thoughts about competing in the Ladder Match that includes Shawn Michaels, Edge, Chris Benoit, Jeff Hardy, Kane, John Cena, Shelton Benjamin, Gregory Helms, Johnny Nitro & Joey Mercury, & the \"Nature Boy\" Ric Flair.Canadian Stampede WrestlingNorth American Heavyweight Champion Jake Roberts Vs. Big Daddy Ritter(Junk Yard Dog) - This match was very unique. It isn't like the usual Ladder Matches we see today. Roberts and Ritter was using a one sided ladder and with help from the referee would climb the ladder for the championship belt. Nothing really special but basically here only for history value only. 3/5Shawn Michaels Vs. Intercontinental Champion Bret Hart - This was during Bret Hart's second I.C. Title run and it during the early stages of Shawn Michaels becoming the \"Heartbreak Kid.\" Michaels and Hart mostly kept this match on the ground and used the ladder to infelct pain on one another. Not a bad match but doesn't top their future bouts for the WWE Championship. Mostly here to display how WWE took the Ladder Match concept and re-invented it. 4/5SummerSlam (August 27, 1995)Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels Vs. Razor Ramon - Really glad WWE chose this match to put on here and not Michaels' and Razor's Wrestlemania X Ladder Match because most people forget that this match took place. Razor and Michaels put on a complete different match then from what they put on at Wrestlemania X. This match doesn't disappoint and it delivers. 4.5/5SummerSlam (August 30, 1998)Triple H Vs. Intercontinental Champion The Rock - The Rock and HHH topped their match from Fully Loaded a month earlier here. Even though Austin/Undertaker was the main event for this SummerSlam, HHH and The Rock stole the show. The Rock and HHH told a good story with HHH competing with an injured knee and over coming the punishment inflected on him and The Rock being the most ruthless he has ever been up to this point in his career. Mark Henry and Chyna playing significant roles in the match as well. This match would be the rocket ship for both The Rock's and HHH's careers that led to both men becoming big stars and World Champions in the future. 5/5No Mercy (October 17, 1999)Edge & Christian Vs. New Brood (Hardy Boyz) - This is the match that eventually put both teams on the map. This being the first tag team Ladder Match, all four men put on a great performance while putting on great and nonstop action all the way through. Never a slow moment in this match and this match delivered and then some. 5/5 [Also Available on \"Edge: Decade Of Decadence\"]SummerSlam (August 27, 2000)World Tag Team Champions Edge & Christian Vs. Hardy Boyz Vs. Dudley Boyz - This was the first TLC Match and it provided new and more unpredictable spots then from their Ladder Match earlier in the year at Wrestlemania. So many breath taking and exciting spots in this one that are too many to call. Awesome match and just one of those firsts that can never be over done again. 5/5Starrcade (December 17, 2000)Shane Helms & Shannon Moore Vs. Jamie Noble & Evan Karagias Vs. Jung Dragons - This match was for a shot at the WCW Cruiserweight Champion Chavo Guerrero Jr. All six men were at their prime here and they put on nonstop action all the way that was really the match of the night for Starrcade this year. Not really spotfesty like the TLC Matches in the WWE but these six men put on one heck of a perfromance that produced a great and exciting match. 5/5 [Also available on \"Starrcade: The Essential Collection\"]Royal Rumble (January 21, 2001)Intercontinetal Champion Chris Benoit Vs. Chris Jericho - Honestly, this match is one of the most brutal and violent one-on-one Ladder Matches of all-time. Benoit and Jericho just went out there and beat the holy hell out of each other. Both Jericho and Benoit takes soem hard bumps and Jericho's chairshot to Benoit when he dives through the ropes is very hardcore. This is one of those matches that when you look back on the PPV, this match was the match of the night. Just a show stealing match and a classic at that. 5/5WrestleMania X-Seven (April 1, 2001)Edge & Christian Vs. World Tag Team Champions Dudley Boyz Vs. Hardy Boyz - TLC II followed the exact same procedure as from TLC I only with the exception of Rhyno, Spike Dudley, & Lita all coming out and getting involved to a degree. The match was highlighted by Edge leaping off a 20 foot ladder and spearing Jeff Hardy (who was hanging off the hooks holding the belts) out of mid air to the floor. Another great TLC Match and one that will never be forgotten. 5/5Smackdown (May 24, 2001)World Tag Team Champions Chris Jericho & Chris Benoit Vs. Edge & Christian Vs. Dudley Boyz Vs. Hardy Boyz - Definitely the most forgotten and rare TLC Match in history. Mainly because of Edge not including this match when he says \"I have never lost a TLC Match\" and Benoit & Jericho just winning the Tag Team Titles on the previous Raw in the match where Triple H suffered his first quadricept injury. Benoit & Jericho bringing out new and unpredictable things to this TLC Match that we haven't seen before including Chris Benoit going through a table after trying to hit his diving headbutt off the top rope and suffering a con-chair-to to his already injured ribs from E&C; that led to having neck surgery a month later. A \"lost forgotten classic\" here. 5/5No Mercy (October 21, 2001)Edge Vs. Intercontinental Champion Christian - Its interesting to see Edge and Christian going head to head with each other in a Ladder Match but this one doesn't top Edge's and Christian's later Ladder Matches and also doesn't come close to their prevoius ones. But still a good match to check out. 4.5/5Raw (May 27, 2002)Intercontinental Champion Eddie Guerrero Vs. RVD - Eddie and RVD surpassed their match from Backlash. The ladder really meshed well the styles of both men which allowed RVD and Eddie to take their regular moves and make them more devastating by using the ladder. RVD and Eddie put on a wrestling clinic while producing a tremendous Ladder Match in the process. Classic match and without of a doubt one of the best Ladder Matches in history in my book. 5/5 [Also Available on \"Cheating Death: The Eddie Guerrero Story\"]Raw (July 1, 2002)WWE Undisputed Champion The Undertaker Vs. Jeff Hardy - The back story to this match was to display the beating the Undertaker gave Hardy and Hardy refusing to give up and actually having the chance winning the Undisputed Championship. A good match but Jim Ross' commentating really made it more then what it was. 4.5/5Raw (October 7, 2002)World Tag Team Champion Kane Vs. Chris Jericho & Christian Vs. Bubba & Spike Dudley Vs. RVD & Jeff Hardy - Kane was going it alone in this TLC Match and he did a fantastic job holding his own against the other three teams. Lots of exciting and breath taking spots in this match that includes Hardy dropping a leg drop to Kane through a table from the top of the ladder, RVD hitting the \"Van-Terminator\" to Kane, and Kane chokeslamming Jericho from the top of the ladder. Lots of hard and impactive shots in this match where one includes Bubba Dudley suffering a concussion where he doesn't remember the match to this day. 5/5 [Also Available on \"RAW: 10th Anniversary\"]Unforgiven (September 12, 2004)Chris Jericho Vs. Christian - This Ladder Match was for the vacant Intercontinental Championship. Christian topped his previous match with Edge here as Christian and Jericho told a good story just like what HHH/Rock and Jericho/Benoit did. Brutal match where both Jericho and Christian takes a lot of hard bumps. 5/5WrestleMania 21 (April 3, 2005)Kane Vs. Chris Jericho Vs. Intercontinental Champion Shelton Benjamin Vs. Chris Benoit Vs. Christian Vs. Edge - This was the first Money In The Bank Ladder Match and to me it still holds the title as being the greatest MITB Ladder Match to date. Shelton Benjamin created his own highlight reel as he stole the show here. Benoit told a great story with his arm being injured and nearly winning the match with Edge becoming the \"Ultimate Opportunist\" character that we see from him today. Terrific match. 5/5SummerSlam (August 21, 2005)Eddie Guerrero Vs. Rey Mysterio - This was a great Ladder Match but the whole \"Dominic Is My Son\" storyline was just so stupid. A good Ladder Match where Eddie & Mysterio brought out some new innovative moves tot he match. Interferences from Vickie Guerrero & Dominic himself. Still a good match with the idiotic storyline. 4.5/5Raw (October 3, 2005)Matt Hardy Vs. Edge - This was a \"Loser Leaves Town\" Match as hardy and Edge ended their rivalry here. This was another great Ladder Match but just doesn't come up to par with their previous Ladder Matches with each other. But still another great match among the two Ladder Match veterans. 4.75/5Raw (January 15, 2006)WWE Champion Edge Vs. Ric Flair - The back story to this match was to display Flair can still take a beating along with Flair possibably winning the WWE Title in his hometown of Charlotte, North Carolina. Flair gets very bloody here but he held his own against the ladder match veteran Edge. Another good TLC Match thats worth a view. 4.5/5Unforgiven (September 17, 2006)WWE Champion Edge Vs. John Cena - I give props to Cena here. Being booed like crazy in Edge's hometown of Toronto and competing in Edge's match, Cena did an outstanding job. Both brought their best stuff and they deliver a fantastic TLC Match. 5/5Raw (November 20, 2006)Intercontinental Champion Jeff Hardy Vs. Johnny Nitro - This match gave Nitro the title \"The Superstar On The Rise.\" This was Nitro's first Ladder Match and he did a wonderful job hanging in there toe to toe with Hardy. Another great match in their series. 4.5/5Armageddon (December 17, 2006)WWE Tag Team Champions Paul London & Brian Kendrick Vs. The Hardys Vs. William Regal & Dave Taylor Vs. MNM - We all know what the Hardys and MNM can bring to this type of match but they produced a great Ladder Match with the daredevils London and Kendrick with Regal and Taylor not quite being \"a fish out of water\" with their mat based style of wrestling. Joey Mercury takes one of the most violent & sick shots from the ladder which crushes the face of Joey Mercury just in seconds from being hit with it. Another fantastic and off the wall Ladder Match. 5/5WWE did an AWESOME job with this DVD. I HIGHLY recommend this set to anybody who is a wrestling fan. If you want to see breath taking and the \"OH MY GOD\" moments, then this DVD set is for you."],["You clearly like Ladder Matches - why else would you even look at this product? Just buy it! 3 discs! All complete matches! Be honest - you want to see guys falling 20 ft through tables. You want to see Jeff Hardy get speared while hanging in mid-air above the ring. You want to see wrestling that no one can just brush off as 'fake'. You can't fake gravity. Own it, love it, but don't try it at home without health insurance."],["The WWE's compilation DVDs have remained of fantastic quality no matter how much the quality of the modern product has suffered in the last 5 years. This latest set includes some of the most spectacular ladder matches that have ever been seen. Rather than featuring a documentary with bonus matches like some of their DVDs, this set thankfully keeps to the matches themselves, although most matches have some footage of the build-up to them or even a brief interview with one of the participants (eg Edge or HBK) which is quite useful. Unfortunately the matches are introduced by the ever-annoying Todd Grisham.The matches are listed in another review and there are a number of classics on there. The evolution of the ladder match is clear to see from the comparatively tame (but still great) 1992 match between HBK and Bret Hart into the TLC spotfests which are truly awesome to watch. TLC has now evolved again into Money In The Bank which has become a new Wrestlemania tradition and is something to look forward to each year. This collection covers all of that.The match selection is almost flawless but there are a few matches which should have been on there. The WM10 match between HBK and Razor Ramon is mentioned on the DVD as the best ladder match ever and then not featured, instead they show their Summerslam rematch. I can sort of understand this, because the WM match is on the HBK collection but some people won't have seen this. I would have also picked the WMXVI triangle ladder match between the Hardyz, Dudleys and E&C; over their 2nd TLC match (which was essentially a repeat of the first TLC). It would have been cool to see an ECW ladder match to see how they used to do them, but instead we just get one WCW match.Overall though I can't see anyone being disappointed by this set and it is essential viewing for any wrestling fan. I would suggest checking the price on [...] rather than [...] because my set cost me less than half what it is going for on here."],["I love this DVD, the only downfall I can think of is that it is mostly just Edge, Christian, Jeff, and Matt in almost every match from disc 2-3"],["One of the best dvd's out there as far as ladder matches go. Entertaining and worth watching. Awesome dvd buy."],["Definitely, one of the best DVD realeases this year.

Lucky me, hell we're all lucky to see all these matches. For me personally, it was a chance to see the classics (like the TLC's), matches I haven't seen in years (Smackdown's TLC, RVD vs.Guerrero), and matches I've never seen period (4 way tag team match at Armegeddon, Benoit v. Jericho at Royal Rumble).I've seen maybe half of all the matches so far, and I'm constantly picking my jaw up off the floor. So many highlights, I won't even bother to go into detail. Clearly, the is THE best dvd has ever put out, bar none.My only gripe is the very first match, Jake Roberts (he's not even \"The Snake\" yet) v. Big Daddy Ritter (aka, Junkyard Dog). It's probably on here for nostalgia, to see these guys early in their career. Not a fun match, watch it once, then pretend it never happened. One of the funnier things I  noticed on the Shawn Michaels/Razor Ramon match is an advertisement for Shawn's sunglasses and his poster, only 21.99, sadly the 800 # is blurred out. I have a feeling Vince will eventually put out some WCW stuff b/c their match on here is outstanding.Anyway, stop reading this and start watching the dvd.."],["Great DVD. Definitely worth the money.

They were an excellent duo together and should have added a tag match with them in the set.  Rey's run in WWE is different from his WCW run.

They mixed the classic lucha libre/crusierweight style with a mix of extreme action to create a different type of action never seen before in ECW & american...to the point that it caught Eric Bischoff's attention in WCW.(Also available on \"ECW: Path Of Destruction\")ECW 2/96: vs. Juventud Guerrera - This ISN'T the match that Heyman talked about on the \"Rise & Fall Of ECW\" as this was a very short match & not their best ECW \"extreme lucha\" performance.  If you want the best one, check out the \"ECW: Hardcore History\" DVD.Great American Bash '96: vs. Crusierweight Champion Dean Malenko - This was the match that put Mysterio & WCW's crusierweight division on the map in the United States.  Malenko's groundbased style mixed perfectly with Rey's lucha libre to put on the first crusierweight classic match since the Pillman/Liger series 5 years earlier.(Also available on Rey Mysterio \"619\")Nitro 7/'96: vs. Crusierweight Champion Dean Malenko - Very similar to the previous match except it was shorter & Rey got his first crusierweight championship win.(Also available on Rey Mysterio \"619\")Hog Wild '96: WCW Cruiserweight Title vs. Ultimate Dragon - This was a match where they kept trying to outdo each other by doing the same moves to each other at various times.  This was more of a ground based match as the high flyin' didn't come into effect into the end.Fall Brawl '96: WCW Cruiserweight Title vs. Super Calo - Before I get started, I love Calo's mask with the hat & sunglasses in.  They kept going back & forth between the two rings that were setup for the War Games later in the night.  Check out the West Coast Pop from one ring to the next which hasn't been seen since the days of Brian PillmanHalloween Havoc '96: WCW Cruiserweight Title vs. Dean Malenko - This was my favorite match from their series of matches in WCW & one of the greatest crusierweight matches in WCW. They were fast paced & very intense.Starrcade '06: vs. Jushin Thunder Liger - Very similar to the Ultimate Dragon match earlier where there was a heavy focus on mat wrestling as opposed to high flyin'.Spring Stampede '97: vs. Ultimate Dragon - This was more fast paced & impactful than their previous match with Dragon working a stiffer style with suplexes, slams, and kicks while Mysterio still did his airal based offense.Halloween Havoc '97: Mask vs. Title Match vs. WCW Cruiserweight Champion Eddie Guerrero - Most peopel concider this the best match in WCW crusierweight history. The storytelling here was right on point with Eddie going after Rey's mask from time to time while showcasing the high flyin' & ground based lucha libre style. Classic match, no questions asked.(Also available on Rey Mysterio \"619\" & \"Cheating Death, Stealing Life: The Eddie Guerrero Story\")World War 3 '97: vs. WCW Cruiserweight Champion Eddie Guerrero - Ranks right up there with their previous encounter but is always overshadowed by the previous match.Thunder 1/98: vs. WCW Cruiserweight Champion Juventud Guerrera - This is the first WCW Thunder match on DVD.  Mysterio wins the title once again in possibly his best match against Juvi in WCW.Souled Out '98: WCW Cruiserweight Title vs. Chris Jericho - This was at the beginning of Jericho turning heel & showing what he's capable as an entertainer. These two meshed well & gave the best performance of this PPV event with Mysterio's knee being worked on thoughout the match.Road Wild '98: vs. Psychosis - This was a big slow at times to where you hear a couple of \"boring\" chants from the crowd. Just an average encounter between these two.  I would have prefered their \"One Night Stand\" match more than this one.Nitro 2/99: vs. Blitzkreig - Blitzkreig was a wrestler who was actually quicker than Rey but has the same type of offense as Rey.  High flyin', high risk, and high impact moves here.  One of Rey's last matches in WCW with his mask on.SmackDown 7/02: vs. Chavo Guerrero - Mysterio's WWE debut. Chavo just being a body for Mysterio to showcase what he can do against with Chavo getting a few a few moves in here & there.(Also available on Rey Mysterio \"619\")SummerSlam '02: vs. Kurt Angle - This was completely off the hook and went past the call of duty of being a match to get the crowd hooked. This was fast paced & high impact with Mysterio & Angle giving you everything from technical to lucha wrestling. Awesome opener & if you watched Mysterio's \"619\" DVD, there is a funny story behind the opening of this match.SmackDown 6/03 - vs. Crusierweight Champion Matt Hardy - I was at this match live & I can tell you that this was one of the best crusierweight matches in the history of WWE. This is the only time I can remember the Crusierweight Title main eventing SmackDown & with the fued having so much buildup as it had. Hardy showcased why he was so underrated at the time while Mysterio wouldn't give up with his bad leg & eventually the title.SmackDown 1/04: vs. Crusierweight Champion Tajiri - Good back & forth match with Tajiri working on Rey's leg along with using interfearence from Sakota & Akio a.k.a. Jimmy Wang Yang.  Mysterio wins the Crusierweight Title once again.Great American Bash '04: WWE Cruiserweight Title vs. Chavo Guerrero - These two rarely disappoint in their encounters & this was no exception as eventhough WWE was starting to \"ground\" the crusierweights at this time, they still put on a performance that show the show at this PPV.No Way Out '05 - w/Eddie Guerrero vs. WWE Tag Team Champions The Bashams - All four men worked well together here & with Eddie pulling off his \"lying, cheating, and stealing\" towards the end, this was a very entertaining match.Judgment Day '05: vs. Eddie Guerrero - Another great match between these two with nice in-ring storytelling. This is the best Eddie has ever been as a heel. One of the top matches from their series.Eddie Guerrero Tribute Show: vs. HBK - Unfortunally, it took Eddie passing away for this dream match to happen. Both men had similar styles & it was a very memorable match with Shawn working with someone who was alot smaller than him which is a rare in itself.WM22: vs. World Champion Kurt Angle vs. Randy Orton - Let me summerize this, Kurt Angle DOMINATES the whole match with the other two occassionally getting some spots in before Kurt is knocked outside the ring & Mysterio scores a quick pin on Orton. It's nonstop action for those 9 mins but it was disappointing for a World Title Match at WrestleMania.Judgment Day '06: World Heavyweight Title vs. J.B.L. - This match was a step below their match months ago at No Mercy because throughout Mysterio's whole title reign, he was booked as the underdog because of his size instead of being able to hold his own. JBL dominated the match with Mysterio making the big comeback.No Mercy '06: Falls Count Anywhere Match vs. Chavo Guerrero - This was more of an entertaining match than a wrestling match because they mostly brawled all over the arena which is something you rarely (if ever) see them do. But the only downfall was that it was the same type of brawl you see from everyone else when they go into the crowd but it wasn't bad.SmackDown 10/06: I Quit Match vs. Chavo Guerrero - Very similar to their pervious match in that they stuck to more of a brawling style in this match and didn't fight all over the arena. If you liked their previous match, you'll like this one as well.The only negative is that some of the matches get repetative but besides that, I recommend this one for sure."],["Great wall to wall wrestling matches of Rey Misterio of the whole disc !Elizabeth L."],["Good service.

I just think they should've took the same approach they did with this dvd. I mean Rey didn't just have one great match with people like Dean Malenko so there's more than one great match of theirs here. However my only problem is that there's no matches on it of his with people like Billy Kidman, Super Crazy or RVD. He has had fine matches with them as well. Matches where he teamed with Edge were also good.While I complained the HBK dvd has some rare matches but not enough of his big matches. This dvd has more big matches than it does rare matches. Yes Rey had awesome matches with Kurt Angle but I didn't realize until recently that he also had some great matches with Beniot that he actually won. I know there's no chance the WWE would've released that though. Even rarer is a match fresh out of WCW and in another league unmasked as well vs C.M Punk and Eddie Guerrero in a Triple Threat match. I didn't get fully through the set but I don't think Rey has any matches on it where he is unmasked though. Which is no surprise since he never wanted to lose the mask in WCW and Bischoff forced him to with a \"if you don't, you're fired\" threat.One rare match I am happy to see here though is his Eddie tribute match vs HBK. Plus besides his match vs Angle at SummerSlam, they could've had their match on Smackdown before SummerSlam that Rey actually won. Rey has also had good matches teaming with Edge and that culd've been here too.

And that's a shame, because this is one of the best DVDs that's come out from the E in recent memory.First, Rey getting the three disc treatment is impressive in itself, but what's more impressive is the sheer number of matches spread over three discs. I think one of the things that makes the DVD so great is that there are so many matches that haven't appeared on WWE DVDs prior since they are from WCW. I also like that its a DVD that highlights action-filled, fun matches. Much of what you see in Rey's WCW matches was just so fresh at the time and it all holds up very well. The collection does a great job showcasing his time in all three promotions.There are a few omissions, but little are extremely notable. The most glaring is that no matches are included from his unmasked time period in WCW (1999-2001), which is unfortunate as he was a major player in the organization until its demise, but also understandable as both he and McMahon tend to ignore this period for different reasons. Still, the inclusion of perhaps a match for the short-lived Cruiserweight Tag Team Title would have been nice.Also, although the many championship reigns he's had make it hard to include matches from them all, it would have been nice to see matches from his time with Edge and also with RVD. In the case of the Edge reign, it's truly unfortunate that one of Rey's greatest matches, from No Mercy 2002, was against Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit, the latter being the obvious reason for omission.Still, a great set and highly recommended."],["all you'' get is just the video noy the other items that came with this ultamite fan set, no shirt, no armband no nothing , IF THIS IS ADVENTISED DON'T YA THINK inluding the items listed would help boost your ranking"],["good dvd......but i dont recommend it for kidz because it have too many bad words."],["i would recomend this for anyone who is a reymysterio fan rey mysterio 619 only has ten matches this has alot more with rey telling u about each match as u go along"],["My nephew AJ wanted this DVD,in the worst way,and no stores had it, so AJ went on to amazon.com and researched the video and found it, so I ordered it and was amazed that I recieved it in two business days, way to go amazon!!!!

I started watching wrestling in 1985 and by that time his career was winding down in the NWA-Mid Atlantic area and his short comeback in WWE. I have heard stories about him but this is the first real look I've had at him and I enjoyed it.Basically, the story starts with his childhood to his first exposure to Christianity. From there, he got involved in bodybuilding and athletics before meeting the late Stu Hart in Calgary and later the late Dr. Jerry Graham.After traveling to the AWA, Florida and Texas areas, Graham ended up in the WWWF (now known as WWE) and became their heavyweight champion. He definitely changed the way wrestlers should look as almost no one had his physique or his charisma. His interviews were actually more entertaining than his matches. Honestly, he wasn't the most skilled wrestler out there but it didn't matter as people paid good money to see him.What was also interesting was that though a heel, he got as many cheers as boos! He was almost (in a way) a predecesor to guys like The Road Warriors, \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin and The Rock in the sense these guys were supposed to be heels YET they got lots of cheers when they hit the ring!From his height, he fell from grace as drugs and a sour attitude took its toll on him. From his crusade against WWF/WWE to his near death in 2001 to his redemption and reconsiliation with both God and WWE, Billy Graham's journey is anything but boring!Here are the extras:MATCHES:*Vs. Armando Rodriguez - This is from AWA All Star Wrestling (8/25/73). A squash basically.*Vs. Angel Rivera - Also from AWA All Star Wrestling (10/6/73). Another squash.*Vs. Bruno Sammartino (WWWF Title Match) - April 30, 1977 was the day that \"Superstar\" would cement his place in wrestling history as he defeated \"Da Brune\" in Baltimore, MD.*Vs. Ivan Putski (WWWF Title Match) - A title match from Madison Square Garden against \"Polish Power\" Ivan Putski, one of the few men that could match power with Billy Graham at that time!*Vs. Dusty Rhodes (WWWF Title Match) - A title match dubbed a \"Texas Death Match.\" A wild match! Rhodes was one of the few that could match Graham in terms of electrifying the crowd and both these men has the MSG audience at a fever pitch!*Vs. Bob Backlund (WWWF Title Match) - This is actually a match years later in November 21, 1982. By that time, Graham had gone to a \"karate\" gimick and to be honest, it looked terrible!

The DVD is good enough, but that is not good enough if you know what I mean because he was a very special personality and performer and that squared circle.I read this only three stars because I did learn some things about superstar Billy Graham that I did not know about before from his early days. However it was obvious that the WWE had to get their 'cheap shots' in by blending in a mixture of statements from various WWE personnel including Vince McMahon himself that the little Superstar Billy Graham, but gave it a 'sedative effect' by giving him kudos as well. Perhaps I can see that sometimes it's justified but at the same time we'd like to remember him for the good memories he provided us all with.back in those days I remember the August of 1977 match with Ivan putski because I was there that night in the 12th row on the floor. What was special about that was I was 12 years old and we lived 350 miles north of New York City and I beg my father to take me there during his summer and with friends there and he did the ticket cost in 1977 $9.00 which wasn't a king's ransom today, but boy that was a lot of money when you include my father's ticket and my sisters too! in the sole reason I asked him to buy those tickets was to see Superstar Billy Graham.I saw him again in Rochester New York in the early 80's but he was not the same and the karate gimmick was bogus.However this man was indeed well ahead of his time to be certain and we all appreciate the precedence that he set for more great performers to come in the future such is Jesse 'the Body' Ventura and Hulk Hogan to mention a couple. What an incredible wife he has as well because she survived many of these hard times as well as enjoy the ride during the times of 'peaches and cream' in the business.she is a big part of this film because she is a super support system for him and also an obvious a caring woman who defends her man in every opportunity in this DVD. I truly enjoy my purchase but one of the things it lacks are the abundance of extras. Many other great interviews could have been included in this package and perhaps also matches or situations like back in the day when he attacked High Chief Peter Mavia with his ukulele, which set up their future feud...things of this nature are greatly missing here or some other wonderful matches. However the both of the matter is the story that was told an overall it was informative but definitely had WWE filtered quality all over it.still if you're a fan of the Superstar,get this DVD because no one else is going to make another one ever again that I can see.&#34;"],["In the 1970s (1975 to 1978 to be exact) I was fortunate to be old enough to really experience and follow the phenomenal era that was defined by the way too brief arrival of one Superstar Billy Graham's era in the WWWF (even met the man once in Pennsylvania as well as outside the Garden before one of his record setting 19 sell-out MSG performances). I can not begin to explain nor describe the ENORMOUS impact Wayne Coleman (aka Superstar Graham) had in the field of Pro Wrestling in the 1970s! I recall some of the last Graham/Sammartino matches booked at NY's Madison Square Garden in the early summer of 1977 and can easily compare those events to the excitement generated by Ali/Frazier's historic battle in 1971! People paid to stand in the hallways and corridors of MSG in order to witness this wrestling Main Event...And like Ali/Frazier it didn't fail to entertain nor excite! If anything this book not only tells fans the way it truly was for Graham back in the day - like it or not - when he not only became a true mat legend, but a bodybuilding icon as well! Hell, even the legendary Arnold was transfixed by Grahams enormous 22 early on in their California days training as boduybuilers, and became one of his early friends in the process! With Grahams's enormous 22\" biceps Arnold trained and befriended the young grappler early in their careers before each became the leaders in their own unique professions. Since the mid to late 1970s, there has been nothing like Superstar Graham and that inlcludes the contrived and monotonous '80s version of the phenomenal advent of \"Hulkamania\" that was all but born out of Superstar's way too short but still enormously influential reign as WWWF champion from April '77 to February '78. If anything, this book defines the horrible price one unfortunate, yet oddly blessed man was always willing to risk (regardless of how reckless those risks were) in order to achieve ultimate fame and fortune on his own terms, only to have it systematically taken away from him, by design, when he easily  became the most famous pro-wrestler in the world! Graham does't hold anything back and tells it like it is and was! He comes clean with the destructive lifestyle and reckless habits that brought about his rapid downfall after losing the WWWF title to young, talented, but largely uncharasmatic contender named Bob Baclund in 1978. Whether or not you are a wrestling fan, this book will excite you, make you laugh, make you cry, and make you understand the enormous loss of genuine talent when it is eventually neglected."],["SBG really started what we see on wrestling today. This DVD was a real surprise. It was really well made and has tons on history on wrestlers and the business that has changed many times over the years. I met the Superstar at a resturant in Chandler AZ. and he was a true gentleman. This is a must see for wrestling fans of all generations."],["I am a huge superstar fan going back to his late 70s / early 80s heyday.  While I certainly enjoyed this dvd's footage of da man, I was also disappointed by the somewhat \"light\" content and especially the slant that McMahon put on this one.  Obviously, since it is WWE produced, this is no suprise.  As a previous reviewer said, this is way to short to properly chronicle the superstar.  Many of his territories, angles, big matches, etc...were completely left out.  It showed the WWWF as the main and really only stage for him, again understandable as they produced this.  But he was really great outside of the WWWF, what about the NWA, AWA, CWF, Mid-Atlantic, his huge match vs Harley Race?  What troubled me was the way McMahon portrayed him towards the end.  He made the superstar look like a low life who crawled back for forgiveness, and McMahon was very smug and unsincere when he said that he decided to forgive him because he (Vince) was at the top and Graham at the bottom.  He also said that if he was as low as Graham he would not forgive anyone.  The fact that he called Graham a derogatory explative that I will not repeat here -  and a con-man on this dvd, which should be a tribute to Graham, is a disgrace.  When Graham's wife was trying to explain that he is not a con man, and he has alot of character, I found that sad that she had to try and explain.  Sure, Graham admits he lied because he was frustrated, but what about the fact that he was fired from the company, when I have read many times in the past that he said McMahon told him that he would always have a place in the company and there would be a place on the payroll for him?  McMahon fired him when he was very sick and needed support, and after all Graham had done for the company for many, many years?  I don't blame Graham for putting up with this current treatment and biting his tongue on many issues, as at least he is financially ok now as a result.  So, I would reccomend to get this dvd, but keep strictly Graham in mind (proceeds he will make from this), ignore the WWE treatment, and look elsewhere for \"unbiased\" material on him.  Graham's own website is really good by the way."],["I feel the documentary section of the DVD was one of the best WWE has ever produced. It encompassed not only his entire life, but also his entire career, and in addition to Billy's frank and honest commentary about his trials and tribulations out of the squared circle, it had many insights and anecdotes from his wife Valerie, and from many of his peers such as Ric Flair, Dusty Rhodes, Gene Okerlund, Jim Ross, Bruce Prichard and Vince McMahon. In addition, it was also nice to see Vince talk about Billy in the way that he did, giving him his due as a pioneering sports entertainer.However, the extras on the DVD leave much to be desired. The promos were great, but I have issues with the match selections because, in my opinion, they do not highlight the kind of performer he was or the electricity he could bring into a match. First off, to be fair most of what is presented is good with the exception of a number of the matches shown are squashes from his early AWA days, when he was still learning to wrestle. Next, I would have liked to see more from his comeback in 1987-88 (especially some of his matches with Butch Reed, particularly a steel cage match in the fall of '87 from Madison Square Garden) and also a little more from his \"karate gimmick\" run back in '81-'83. Even though the match shown was hard to watch, I would have liked to have seen the promo of him destroying Bob Backlund's championship belt on TV and the Lumberjack Match the two had at MSG, which was the culmination of their feud. Some of the footage from Florida would have been nice, too.Overall, I still recommend the purchase of this set mainly because of the documentary section. While it still has its drawbacks, it still presents a very good spotlight on one of the most imitated stars and legends in wrestling history."],["Before I review the DVD, I want to make something clear:Other than this DVD, I have no other knowledge or \"Superstar\" Billy Graham.  I didn't grow up watching him, so if anything significant is missing from the main documentary feature, I couldn't tell you what it is.I love WWE DVDs like this one.  20 YEARS TOO SOON is unlike any other WWE production released.  It uses the same \"talking heads\" and \"montage\" formats, but this apple is very different from the rest of the barrel.The most successful superstars of today often give credit to guys like Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair, or Dusty Rhodes.  I'm sure there are many others, but those seem to be the big three.  Well, Rhodes and Hogan will be the first to tell you that \"Superstar\" Billy Graham was the original pioneer of sports entertainment.  After watching this DVD, I'm sure most viewers will agree.  Even though there were many great wrestlers who got plenty over with the fans, Graham --- according the documentary --- was the first to break through and put a pop culture spin on the product.As with all other WWE programs like this, 20 YEARS TOO SOON highlights Graham's greatest matches, most famous promos, and struggles with success.The match highlights mainly include Bruno Sammartino and Dusty Rhodes.  There isn't much coverage in this area, but Graham wasn't an active competitor for very long (15 years, I think).  We do get to see some good footage of his rivalries, each very easy to understand why they important for their time.  I hate when WWE just assumes we know things from 20 years ago, don't you?  For example, later in his career, \"Superstar\" used a bizarre \"karate persona\".  I'll leave that one for you to learn about.The promos are as masterful as they come.  Graham wasn't an overly energetic personality like Hogan, Flair, or Rock.  He's much closer to Jake Roberts, where his chosen words and body language didn't require a loud voice.  If you want to compile a Top 10 list of the greatest talkers in televised wrestling, Graham easily deserves a spot.I've read that Graham had stints in other promotions, which aren't included in 20 YEARS TOO SOON.  If that's true, I don't know why they were left out.  Since I'm someone who didn't know much about Graham, I wouldn't have noticed that anything was missing.  But again, I don't think the pro wrestling itself is the heart of the story.The struggles that Graham endured are what I want to address the most, because they are the true core of what the \"Superstar\" wants to be about.  20 YEARS TOO SOON isn't a traditional WWE feature.  It's more of a biography, with wrestling in the background.  Whoever made the final cut of the documentary is to be commended for taking a unique approach to this material.  First off, \"Superstar\" Billy Graham is such a humble and grateful interviewee that it's impossible to dislike the man.  He shows no anger, bitterness, or jealousy throughout the program.  While he acknowledges how innovative he was for his time, Billy Graham equally enjoys seeing how his style influenced many of today's talent.The documentary does address Graham's battle with drugs, health, and being physically unable to recapture his magic.  I don't wanna get into a steroid debate, but Graham's story makes a good case for having a testing policy of some kind.  His health issues are easy to understand why they happened, how they affected his career, and how Graham adapted to them.Another strength in the documentary is that it doesn't focus too long on the negative aspects.  Sure, it gets pretty rough in a few spots, but we are always reminded of the light at the end of the dark tunnel.  20 YEARS TOO SOON is ultimately a celebration of life.  I don't wanna give anymore away, but I will spoil this tiny surprise.  Vince McMahon actually gets a tad teary-eyed when he talks about \"Superstar\".  I'll leave the rest of the gripping tale for you to discover.The 2-disc set includes a handful of matches, deleted scenes, and promo footage.  I like the selection of matches overall, but a few are a tad short.  None are exactly masterpieces, but I always like trying to pretend that I'm watching a 70s broadcast live on TV.  Fake nostalgia, I know.The deleted scenes are all great; I have no idea why they aren't just in the main cut, other than WWE showing this on PPV.  And as I said before, the promos and interviews are genius.  I dare you not to laugh when Graham talks about \"crushing coconuts\".20 YEARS TOO SOON is a DVD any fan will enjoy, as long as you're aware that the actual wrestling is secondary to the biography and historical details.  I'm convinced that \"Superstar\" Billy Graham is most responsible for sports entertainment as we know it.  He was ahead of his time and never got the incredible legacy he deserved.  But because his peers know how much he mattered, I'm convinced that pro wrestling is in good hands."],["All i can say is this is an awesome dvd of one of my all time favorite wrestlers,Superstar Billy Graham.The only problem i have with it is it should have been a 3 dics set rather then just one.Or at least 2 dics,they showed tons of great clips during the life story part of the dvd,that they could have added to a 2nd dvd an included all that footage in its complete form.Ether way if your a fan of the Superstar this dvd is a must have..."],["I lived in Minnesota from the early 70s to the early 90s.

The DVD shows the whole story, There is a promo he cut wearing a \"Arizona State\" T-shirt and his physique is absolutely superhuman.  Conversely, the DVD also shows him at his depths, the DVD has match when he wrestles Bob Backlund, and Billy looks to have lost 200 pounds, and seriously appears to be one-hundred years old.

Surprised, yet delighted.  I'm a new fan of this series, having seen it for the first time less than a year ago, and I can honestly say that it is my favorite Britcom.  I wish that they would list some more details than just Series 4-5 and the Specials.  I would like to know which specials are in here (presumably it will have To Hull and Back and A Royal Flush, as they were the specials for those 2 seasons, but will there be any more besides those two)?If you saw the first set and weren't overly impressed, just wait and keep watching.  Grandad died and was replaced by Uncle Albert in season 4, and I think he was a much better character.  All he ever does is drive people crazy with his reminiscing about the days \"During the War\"...  Uncle Albert was a great war hero who sunk every boat he ever sailed on, including the time he crashed into an aircraft carrier because he couldn't see it.  His excuse was that its lights weren't lit, but they said that it didn't matter because it was in broad daylight.Anyway, I can't wait for this set to come out, and will buy it as soon as it is available.

My collection is about 90 percent British TV. I purchase form Amazon.co.uk where they have so many of my favorites I will be Entertained when I want, and as often as I want , by one of the best comedies ever made. As I write this , the review and the comment I am replying to  are well over a year old . Most fans will already know about DVDs from the UK. Look for other Series with David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst , such as \"Open All Hours\" the first series with David Jason, \" The Darling Buds Of May\" with David Jason and the first roll for Catherine Zeta Jones , \" A Touch Of Frost\" a great police  drama with David Jason now in it's ( at least ) 15th season , \" Goodnight Sweetheart \" with N.Lyndhurst\" a very good and unique comedy/drama/sci-fi hit ( watch to see what I mean ) , \" The Piglet Files\" N.Lyndhurst comedy , many more series with both these great actors. I would be remiss if I didn't mention \" The Green Green Grass\" , a spinoff of OF&H . Another great British comedy \" Last Of The Summer Wine \"  the longest running comedy series in British TV History . It began in 1973 and a series will air in 2010 . If you want to fall in love with great characters and have at your beckoning , from Amazon.co.uk , hundred of episodes available in two series sets..1-2 , 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, 9-10, 11-12, 13-14, and 15-16 so far, with this many more sets remaining to be released , just take my advice and see what I mean. It would be , in my opinion , a tie between OF&H and LOTSW as the best comedy ever conceived . Johns Sullivan , who wrote OF&H ( also \"The Green Green Grass\" , most episodes , even sang the theme song to OF&H )  from beginning to end ,and Roy Clarke who wrote LOTSW ( also \"Keeping Up Appearances\" , \"Open All Hours\" ) are two of the most talented writers who ever took pen in hand. When a writer has complete control of a series and writes every episode , the characters remain \"true to their character\" . In any series written by a staff of writers , such as a lot of American series, you will see characters in one episode almost as a complete opposite of what they were in other episodes . EG; Do you recall an episode of \"Sanford And Son\" ( based on a iconic British series \" Steptoe And Son\" ) where a burglar was surprised by Fred and in the shuffle lost his gun ? In this episode , Fred was afraid to have anything to do with the gun . It was Lamont who , along with Rolo ,who wanted to sell it at pawn shop. Ordinarily Lamont was the law abiding , good citizen , who would have immediately called their policemen friends and turned the gun in . Fred was usually the type who would have jumped at the chance to sell it  , never Lamont. This is only one example of many writers who can change a character from episode to episode . British series are usually written by one , or a two member team, and when you watch the first show, you will know the character in the last . I like it like this ."],["This is my all time favorite British Comedy.  I own all of the episodes on Brit VHS and love them.  I fell in love with the Trotters when I was stationed in England in the early 90's.  I am sooo excited that they are bringing out the rest of the shows.I wish there was more info.  Which specials?  Will it include the Millenium Specials?  They are great!

This is a must have for any connoisseur of British humor.  I have DVDs and tapes of all of the well known Brit sits and I can't tell you how good this series is.

What a bunch of characters!You won't go wrong with this series.  It's watched over and over in my house.  I highly recommend the purchase.  ENJOY!!A note of caution - if you're not into a wry, definitely British sense of humor, this may not the series for you.  You more than likely won't understand it or find it funny."],["Well judging from my title you probably know what I am talking about.  With more character and plot development this comedy got better and better through the mid to late eighties.  You need a basic sitcom at the start that gets moderate attention as OFAH did, but its only then that you can start bending reality slightly to make something even funnier.  Don't get me wrong 1-3 were great in their own right.  Then 4-5 were the gateway to 6 and 7 and the other specials that really had the right formula and character development.  Remember Trigger will call Rodney Dave for twenty plus years.  Not funny in the first episode but by the time we get to 'Modern Men.'  Its the funnist 'in' joke of any comedy in history.I am an expat, and was devasated to have to sell all my OFAH videos before coming to the States.  Luckily, just a few years later, and to my overwhelming joy they have started to be released here. Now America can enjoy the hilarity of Del-boy Rodney and Co.This comedy ran for the better part of 20 years.  Why?  everybody asks.Answer?  John Sullivan.  For Sullivan knows the formula of great comedy, namely tragedy.  Del and Rodneys upbringing was tragic.  Sullivan himself has a phenomenal social awareness and can push the tragedy and comedy at almost the the same time.  Watch Grandads funeral, the first episode of season 4.  It starts off pretty grim, but then when they drop his hat into the grave and it turns out to be the vicars hat, then you should understand the co-relation of this comedy, tragedy thing Im talking about.One of my favorite lines ever is when Rodney says after his marriage is failing \"Ive got this horrible feeling that if there is such a thing as reincarnation, knowing my luck I'll come back as me!\"  Genius!To all Americans, this is the best comedy of all time on any continent, and if you give it time you will see why.  funny lines, as well as funny situations.  Not many comedies can say they can do both.  By the time you get to season 6 you actually start watching them to find out how these peoples lives will turn out, really you will.Of course you don't have to beleive me, just read all of the other high reviews of OFAH on this Amazon site."],["Only Fools and Horses is not for the faint of heart.  It is truly British comedy, filled with working class everymen speaking in Cockney rhyming slang and hustling to make a quid or two.  The writing is unimpeachable and the characters are full of life and brilliantly rich and colorful.  You will root for them all.And this is a great 4-disc set.  In addition to the complete series four and five, it contains four of the feature length Christmas specials:To Hull and BackA Royal FlushDatesThe Frog's LegacyThis set is a must-have for die-hard fans of British humor."],["This disk is as great as the first (series 1 thru 3) and is a delight to watch. David Jason is a delight to watch, and Buster Merryfield is great as Granddad's brother. The characters are ( Lennard Pearce, who played Granddad, and Buster Merryfield, who plays Granddads brother) are two different characters, and David Jason(Del-Boy) has a new foil to play off. If you enjoy British comedies, this series is great."],["Only Fools and Horses, which ran for over 20 years (1981-2003), was one of Britain's most popular (and, in my opinion, one of the best) comedies ever made.  Briefly, for those unfamiliar, David Jason (A Touch of Frost, The Darling Buds of May, Open All Hours, Micawber) stars as Derek \"Del Boy\" Trotter, a smooth-talking, street-smart, self-important dealer in goods of questionable quality and dubious provenance, to say the least.  He is assisted (though hindered may be a more accurate word!) by his not-so-street-smart (albeit better educated) younger brother, Rodney (Nicholas Lyndhurst).The first three series (contained in the first BBC boxed set) were produced between 1981-1983 and were the only ones to feature Grandad (Lennard Pearce, who sadly died, aged 69, of a heart attack in December 1984 just as the fourth series had begun production).  Though there were some truly memorable episodes and many hilarious lines in those first three series, I do feel the series as a whole became stronger with the commencement of the fourth series.  For one thing, the supporting cast became larger.Del's half-witted friend, Trigger (Roger Lloyd Pack--farmer Owen from The Vicar of Dibley), who cannot seem to get it into his head that Rodney's name is \"Rodney\" not \"Dave\"; and the pompous, sharp-dealing, used-car salesman Boycie--who would sell his own grandmother if there were a profit in it--are back.  Now, however, we get to meet Boycie's hilariously tarty wife, Marlene (Sue Holderness of Sandbaggers 3), who we get the distinct impression has slept with most if not all of Boycie's friends at some point!  The last episode in series three introduced us to two others who become regulars from series four on:  Mike the barman (Kenneth MacDonald, who remained with the show until his sudden death from a heart attack in 2001 (he was 50)); and Del's lorry-driving friend, Denzil (Paul Barber of The Full Monty), who is always letting Del talk him into doing something he really doesn't want to do.  Sadly, Denzil's wife, Corinne, is never seen after series three as the actress died of a drug overdose.The most notable newcomer to the series is, of course, Uncle Albert (Buster Merryfield, who remained with the show until his tragic death in 1999 from a brain tumour.  He was 78).  Where Grandad was so obviously a fairly frail old man in the winter of his life, Uncle Albert is full of life and energy--a rosy-cheeked, white-bearded, jolly old salt who enjoys playing the piano at the pub and recounting his war stories (to everyone's chagrin!).  Though a loyal British sailor, one can't help thinking the German's ought to have awarded him a medal for services rendered (albeit unintended, of course!).This boxed set contains the complete fourth and fifth series (thirteen 30-minute episodes from 1985-1986) plus all four Christmas specials from that period:  \"To Hull and Back\" (90 minutes--chronologically this episode follows series four), \"Royal Flush\" (80 minutes), \"The Frog's Legacy\" (60 minutes), and \"Dates\" (80 minutes).  The last three specials are from 1986, 1987 and 1988 respectively and follow series five.Just as a point of interest, the show becomes serial in nature with the \"Dates\" special (ie. the episodes and specials must be watched in order from then on).  Two final series followed it, which were produced between 1989-1991 (both with 50-minute episodes), and a host of Christmas specials were made which concluded (to date) in 2003.In conclusion, it's not often one finds a comedy of such quality as this classic series--a series which only gets better each time you watch it (and this set is particularly rife with hilarious episodes!).  It's one of my all-time favourites, and one which I recommend extremely highly to anyone who enjoys the very best in British comedy.  I only hope the BBC will release series six and seven and the remaining specials!"],["I purchased a region free dvd player so that I could purchase comedies like this from Amazon.co.uk (recently released Series 7 on DVD).  David Jason is his usual brilliant self as Del Boy and the characters of Trig and Boise are in the show more and are hilarious.  I notice in the description that there are some specials in addtion to the series and would love to know what they are (These are very expensive on Amazon.co.uk and need a region Free DVD Player).  If you like the comedy of David Jason, I would also recommend 'The Darling Buds of May' (Catherine Zeta Jones also stars).Keep an eye out for Series 6 (probably the funniest!) - Rodney wins a drawing competition and has to pretend Del-Boy is is father and he is only 16.Brilliant Stuff!"],["Finally I got series 4 and 5. Even better than the first three. Now that I have watched them I am ready for the next lot. This was one of the few comedy series that got better and better. The characters were developed further and became even closer to our hearts. If there has ever been a better show than this I'd like to know what it is. Why don't they just release all of the show here already. I know they are out in the UK. Maybe I should buy one of those Universal players. Any way, hurry up and release some more.

Of all of Fred Astaire's dancing partners Ms. Powell is by far the best match.  In this film the two greatest dancers in history give the world a film to remember, which sadly has been forgotten.  The film includes a wonderful Cole Proter score with the songs &quot;Please Don't Monkey With Broadway&quot; and &quot;I've Got My Eyes on You&quot;.  Astaire and partner played by George Murphy are dancers looking to hit the big time in New York, and Powell is the Broadway star they both fall in love with.  This is a classic feast for the eyes and ears that no musical or Astaire fan should miss."],["I just got through watching the film and I can see why it won. The dance sequences were beautiful. The Wedding of the Painted Doll was one of my favorite musical and dance scenes. I'm 30 but have always enjoyed black and white films and this one by far is my favorite. I plan on getting it on DVD. The dance and even the small amounts of comedy and wit during a few of the scenes had me laughing. I recommend giving this movie a try. It maybe an old film - but like a lot of things from 1929 - it's a classic and it is one that should continue to be acknowledged. The dance numbers were incredible, the acting was dramatic but it was supposed to be. In knowing that, I enjoyed watching."],["This is a great choice for someone who like classic movies.  The staging of the dance sequences is way ahead of its time.  It's an enjoyable viewing experience."],["Even though it was advertised as \"All Talking! All Singing! All Dancing!\", this movie, named the Best Picture of 1929, contains certain elements that point out that sound was still unfamiliar territory to most filmmakers. For example, this movie is still using title cards to announce the chapters. Also, the actors are still using exaggerated gestures to indicate what is going on as if nobody can hear what they are saying. For example, in one scene, characters indicate their drunkenness by hiccuping and wildly staggering about. They appear more like they are dying from some horrible poison than just suffering the aftermath of too much alcohol.  This unpolished musical was undoubtedly recognized more for combining drama with the musical revue than for its overall production value. The inclusion of a major production number, \"The Wedding of the Painted Doll,\" in Technicolor may also have impressed the Academy.The story is basically just a backdrop for the real attraction - the singing and dancing. The vaudeville act of Harriet and Queenie Mahoney come to Broadway where their friend, Eddie Kerns, needs them for his number in a show. Eddie was in love with Harriet, but when he meets Queenie, he falls in love with her. However, she is courted by Jock Warriner, a member of New York high society. It takes a while until Queenie realizes that she doesn't mean anything to Jock. It also takes a while until Harriet recognizes that Eddie is in love with Queenie. End of a very unremarkable story. This film's style is noteable because it is one of the first of many films where the players burst into song with music magically accompanying them and supposedly unrehearsed and complicated choreography appear from nowhere. Also note the brief appearance of two character actors early in their careers - William Demarest and James Gleason.The extras are Warner Brothers shorts that pertain to the talkies and musicals of the late 20s and early 30s. \"The Dogway Melody\" is a 16 minute-long spoof of the original The Broadway Melody with a cast entirely of dogs. You have to see this to believe it. It is funny in an \"Our Gang\" kind of way. There are also Metro Movietone Reviews consisting of five shorts less than 20 minutes each of some singing and dancing and comedy bits taken directly from the stage. \"Van & Schenk\" is a 5 minute short with Gus Van and Joe Schenk singing \"Chinese Firecracker\" and \"Way Down South\" with piano accompaniment sounding like they are singing through a megaphone. \"Broadway Trailer Gallery\" contains trailers for the four sequels to Broadway Melody. These films were Broadway Melody of 1936, 1938, 1940, and 1944. Overall, I'd say the extras were more enjoyable than the movie itself."],["CONSIDERING WHEN THIS MUSICAL WAS MADE, IT IS A GREAT FORERUNNER TO THE LATER BROADWAY MELODY FILMS. IT IS FAR SUPERIOR TO THE REMAKE WITH LANA TURNER AND JOAN BLONDELL. IN MY OPINION BROADWAY MELODY OF 1936 WAS THE BEST BROADWAY MELODY MADE. YOU CAN'T REALLY TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM BROADWAY MELODY OF 1929,  IN AS MUCH AS IT PRESENTED ITSELF WITH A LOT OF VIGOR, GOOD CAST AND MUSIC WHICH FOR ITS DAY SURELY HAD MOVIE GOERS WONDERING WHEN OTHER MUSICALS WERE COMING.  IF YOU ARE A MOVIE MUSICAL BUFF BE SURE TO INCLUDE BROADWAY MELODY OF 1929 IN YOUR COLLECTION."],["Sure, it's dated and schlocky and a real relic... but it's also the prototype for the MGM musical, in that it was a \"story musical\", with the numbers arising from situations in the narrative. Of course, it helps that the narrative is a backstage musical, where two sisters (Anita Page and Bessie Love), fresh from the country, come to New York City to make it on Broadway. Along the way, they encounter heartache and betrayal and tests on their sisterhood, but that way happens to be paved with numbers like \"The Wedding of the Painted Doll\", \"You Were Meant for Me\" and \"The Broadway Melody\". This was the big one for MGM: the all-singing, all-dancing, all-talkie musical which wowed 'em at the box office, and wound up with the Academy Award as Best Picture. To think this is a good movie by any stretch of the imagination takes more imagination than most people would care to give, but it is entertaining, and paved the way for \"The Broadway Melody of 1936\", \"The Broadway Melody of 1938\", \"The Broadway Melody of 1940\" and, finally, \"Two Girls on Broadway\" (1940), the remake that cast Lana Turner and Joan Blondell as stand-ins for Anita Page and Bessie Love. Though klunkier than any of the others, \"The Broadway Melody\" has an authentic show biz atmosphere which is certainly nostalgic. And the klunkiness of the numbers must be seen to be believed: the parodies in \"Singin' in the Rain\" are far more polished than anything in the original."],["Anybody fooled into thinking that \"The Broadway Melody of 1929\" is a full-fledged musical be forewarned.  This film is essentially a backstage melodrama with acting and story values that are not uncommon to your average daytime serial.  Certain allowances have to be made for this film because it is an early talking picture and the craft of working in this new medium had yet to be refined.  This is not to say that the film doesn't have anything to recommend it.  Bessie Love as Hank, the level-headed sibling of the film's featured sister act, gives probably the only full-bodied acting job.  Anita Page as Queenie, the starstruck sister, is extremely easy on the eyes.  There's a fantastic song score by Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown.  Ultimately one has to view this film more as a historic artifact and appreciate it for the ground it broke for future musical projects.  This DVD contains an amusing parody of the film, \"Dogway Melody\" performed entirely by canines.  As enjoyable as this short subject was it gave me a little bit of a pause because it appears as though the dogs are being manipulated by invisible wires."],["Thin plot, mediocre performances, and chronic melodrama.  What else but a large Hollywood musical, right?  Right, except this is generally considered the first, and thus the birth, of the genre.  If you're inclined to musicals, you'll find much to enjoy here.  There are large dance numbers, and quieter moments when the star-crossed lovers break into song.  Bessie Love steals the show as the fiery, determined showgirl hoping with her sister to get a big part in a Broadway musical.  We've become so accustomed to seeing the genre done bigger and better, that I mostly enjoyed it as a piece of film history."],["O.K. first a general comment:Can someone please explain to me why so many people refer to this film as \"dated\" to put it down...It was made in 1929... Thank you to the reviewer who pointed this out!If you want something more up to date, go rent \"The Terminator\" (!)Back in 1929 things were rather... 1929s'ish... (errrrrrr... duh...)That said, actually one reason the film is so relevant today is because of just how ahead of its time it was...Basically it was the first all talkie musical... it also had a colorized sequence (now lost), and was quite racy...Sure... it lacks the smooth Lush technical perfectionism of the G-Rated MGM musical greats that would follow...and has some strange quirks, some almost B-movie 50's sexploitationish... though there is no nudity, the film has almost constant \"beneath the surface\" as well as overt tease.  This coupled with the film's Jazz Age POV and  occasional zaniness make it... o.k. dated but in a funny way...All this said, the two leading gals (Bessie Love and Anita Page) in the film are HOT (not glamorous... hot...)Times were different then... the leading men are a bit fat... and the girls \"petite\" bordering on boyish,  yet still... as I said, hot...I also find the film interesting because the ladies have the lead... not the men... and the leading men are far from ravishing and suave (something that would become the standard in musicals to come!)And, the cinematography is quite edgy for the the times (its a nicely cut film, doesn't drag.)Another nice thing is that most the actors use American (NY/Broadway-esque) dialect... as opposed to \"proper\" (&lt;-- be sure to roll the \"r\" poshly) Queen's English.other points:As many have pointed out though, there is the strange use of title cards as segues, and while some people point out certain dated elements of the acting, the presence of seasoned veteran vaudevillians and stage actors and the film's effort to find its place in the post silent movie era also make it great to watch.So to conclude:  Yeah, this isn't your typical Academy award winning film... plot is definitely not so heavy... its sort of a light comedy with a few heavy moments, and song and dance routines now and then.  Fans of the later musicals will be disappointed by the relatively lackluster choreography that would become trademarks of the later MGM musicals, however, Broadway fans might appreciate the film's realism.  Another interesting thing about the film is that the actors at times seem to mouth the other actor's lines (!)(!)(!)  (Is this just my imagination???)All in all, a fun film...  not timeless, more of historical significance, but still great to watch.Incidentally, if you liked the recent musical \"The Drowsy Chaperone\" you might get a kick out of this... but as this film is definite \"Jazz Age\", its really the era right after Chaperone, when Victorian mores had already unfolded."],["The first talkie to win the BEST PICTURE Oscar finally comes to DVD, and it was well worth the wait.Warner Home Video has packaged a dandy new DVD of \"THE BROADWAY MELODY\" that looks better than any 75 year old movie has a right to.

The great songs of Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown debuted here including the famous title tune and YOU WERE MEANT FOR ME.As much fun as the movie is, the superb extras WB has assembled here are worth the price of the DVD alone. 5 METRO MOVIETONE REVUE shorts from the 1928-29 era, filled with long-forgotten vaudeville stars, shine here, proving that some of these  performers were really terrific and shouldn't be forgotten. Added to this, is a nifty little vaudeville short with the team of Van & Schenck who perform two novelty songs, one of which will have you rolling on the floor.Last but not least is the DVD debut of MGM's 1930 DOGVILLE COMEDY SHORT-The Dogway Melody. This 20 minute classic features an all Canine cast, parodying The Broadway Melody. It was co-directed by Jules White, who later helmed THE THREE STOOGES best shorts at Columbia.You'll love the movie, which is packaged with its original poster on the cover, and the extras make this an extra special treasure for any true classic film fan."],["I also received this dvd in just a few days from ordering itgood service from this vendorI have not watched the dvd yet"],["The acting is bad - no Barrymores here.

It's saving grace is the catchy tune that's still around today, \"Broadway Melody.\" And don't say that all of my gripes are because it was made in 1929 because \"All Quiet On The Western Front\" and \"The Champ\" are two very fine movies made during the same era.

But it's great to see all those 20's/30's fashions; hear the  Jazz Age slang; study the dancing styles and techniques of that era -- and of course hear THOSE SONGS again ( and again and again), some of which have become US Standards.But with all its defects, the story moves rapidly. We are also\" treated\" to some 1929 attitudes towards gay men and women, which although not complimentary is in keeping with the almost vaudevillian, outlook towards gay cliches. It is a pity that the 2-strip Technicolour musical sequence is missing, even though Technicolour is listed in the credits. Overall however this is a worthwhile, and important film in the development of US Cinema, although it may not have the \"artiness\", or the quality of the great silent films and some other early sound films. However, it was an MGM production and the values were high. The acting performances are in tune with the story and the times amd again we are transported back to  when our grandparents or great grandparents were \" playing up\" and rebelling, just as we did, and future generations will continue to.The DVD transfer is a little grainy and \" messy \" in parts, but the sound quality is superb.The features are of great historical and entertainment value, although I felt a little embarrassed by the dressed up\" talking \"  dogs ... but again that was great entertainemnt\" in those days \".

King made this movie, went back to Broadway to do musicals, and has been largely forgotten. He plays an almost stereotypically brash, Jazz Age American. He also had a pleasant voice. This film is stagy in many places (because of sound, cameras had to be stabilized - the result was long periods of static scenes that move slowly when someone isn't chattering away into the prehistoric microphones that sometimes altered vocal quality). The film also started lots of cliches: \"Go out there and come back a star!\" began in this film. A must for early film buffs, those who love film history, and musical fans.

I hope they'll continue to release early sound films (and also a lot more silents!).I really enjoyed the movie and thought the DVD image was very satisfactory. Clearly, they didn't have the camera negative to work from - but they did the best they could with what they had. A complete restoration would be nice, but, I guess, would be too expensive as yet.The movietone shorts didn't seem to be camera-negative, or direct print-down, either - though the short 'Dogway Melody' might have been - it often looked beautiful, if even the content was a little disturbing :)My one complaint is that no information was presented on the fascinating short films. I would have liked to know what year they were from, when MGM got serious about sound, who the acts where, if they made it into movies ... and so on.A highly recommended disc for all who love musicals and the early sound years. Thank-you again, Warners! Keep those rarities coming!"],["Movie: **1/2  DVD Quality: **1/2  DVD Extras: *****The legend is told that in 1928, M-G-M head Louis B. Mayer urged that his studio's production of \"The Crowd\" not be given the Best Picture Award because he preferred that M-G-M win the award the following year for their planned musical blockbuster, \"The Broadway Melody\".  Whether the story is true or not, it is almost certain that \"The Broadway Melody\" captured the public's interest and critical hosannas not because it was a great movie, but because it was an innovative one.  Here was the biggest, grandest, splashiest example of a brand new genre, the musical film; and musicals, which had only become technically possible a few short months ago with the introduction of sound, were very much in fashion.  Seen today, in proper historical context, \"The Broadway Melody\" is a film that commands respect, but not as much affection; for while it pioneered many of the conventions associated with the great Hollywood musicals, it has long been surpassed by the films that came after it.  Its backstage plot was bettered a scant four years later in \"42nd Street\"; its musical production numbers were trumped around the same time with the innovations of Busby Berkeley; even its wonderful score was reprised more beautifully in later films such as \"Singin' in the Rain\".  Today, \"The Broadway Melody\" is more an historical curio, something definitely worth a first or second look, but not a classic most viewers could or would watch again and again with sustained enthusiasm.That said, the DVD release of this artifact is genuinely a delight, primarily because the extras are so fascinating.  The movie itself is given a somewhat shoddy film-to-DVD transfer: the video is desperately in need of some digital restoration work in several spots; ditto, the soundtrack; and it would help tremendously if the lost two-strip Technicolor footage could be located and restored to brighten up the black and white print. As for the aforementioned extras, they include the Theatrical Trailers for the three subsequent \"Broadway Melody\" films plus the rarely seen Technicolor trailer for the 1944 \"Broadway Rhythm\"; the \"All-Barkie\" canine parody short film \"The Dogway Melody\"; and six other rarely screened musical shorts from the dawn of the sound era, all of which feature vaudeville veterans  performing their shticks for the camera - my favorites were the woman dressed in male drag who sang a spicy song about sailors, and a young lady who turned cartwheels while tap dancing!  Overall, despite my reservations about the main feature, this DVD offers a great package of unusual entertainment, and is definitely recommended to M-G-M musical completists as well as  to those who would enjoy the offbeat Special Features."],["I just wished to correct one review, which uses the name &quot;Jane Powell&quot;, as the equal of Fred Astaire; it wasn't Jane, it was Eleanor Powell who was terrific, in this particular movie; she could really hoof it!"],["\"The Broadway Melody\" was the movie that won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1928, which means this movie is officially older then my grandma. Now the funny thing about the Academy Awards is that is was created to add sophistication to movies. Some people were beginning to wonder whether or not films were healthy for people, whether or not they were morally corrupt, and whether or not movies could be considered art (and this was seventy years BEFORE the world was a witness to \"South Park: Bigger, Longer, & Uncut\"). So the Academy of Motion Picture Sciences was created, along with the Academy Awards, to help make films more respectable. Watching \"The Broadway Melody\" today with this history in mind is a revelation, as this film doesnt really support the fact that movies could be considered art AND entertainment! Now, Im going to try and put myself in 1928's shoes while I describe reasons I think this film won.This was the first musical to be filmed. It was a major box office hit, making a little bit more then $4 million dollars. It was the first movie to have a scene in Technicolor (though using only two colors). And for all the techniques this film helped create, for all the firsts this film had, watching it today feels like watching a dinosaur worse then Barney. The movie just feels OLD! The storyline involves two sisters who are both dancers, who go to New York to become Broadway stars. Along the way there will be trials, tribulations, and jealousy spouts. This is really all there is to the story, as the musical numbers are always the center of attention for this film. There will be long scenes of musical numbers, followed by two minutes of dialog, followed by ten minutes of dancing, followed by three minutes of dialog, and so forth. In total, there is maybe thirty-five minutes of actual story in this movie, hardly worth debating in my case.What is worth debating are the dance sequences. Now, I understand this was the first musical filmed, but that doesnt quite explain all the poor camera shots. During musical numbers the camera will pick a spot to film, and stay there the entire scene. Never mind if the dancers are moving, the camera stays still. There are scenes where the dancers will dance off camera, and the camera will star at an empty stage for a couple of minutes before the dancers come back. Sometimes the camera is in such a poor position, that we cant really see whats going on. There is one musical sequence that is shot from overhead, and I cant figure out what is going on since this sequence in a TAP DANCING sequence! Brilliant, they decide they want to have a tap dancing scene, so they put the camera in a place where you cant even see the dancers feet. Why, why did the director think this was a great idea? Even though I have eighty years worth of movies to benefit me in my experience, didnt the director feel scenes like this looked just a LITTLE funny back then?!Back in 1928? Maybe the director was thinking of how he would watch a Broadway show in the audience, where you got to your seat, and for the whole production you basically saw the show from one point of view. I dont know if this was what the director was thinking, but I do know that even in the audience of a live show I have the ability to turn my head at the very least. Viewing problems aside, there isnt really anything to like about the movie nowadays. The acting, like most acting in the old days, is severally melodramatic and wildly overblown, where even simple things as asking for a cup of coffee is often shouted with exaggerated body motions that follow. I cant say any of the music is really all that catchy anymore, and if I were you I wouldnt be expecting a craving to get the soundtrack when the movie is over.  All in all, it's interesting to see where the movie musical got its start, but it feels like such a fossil these days."],["The staging in ths film is amazing.  It's not as dated as you might think.  Definitely an enjoyable viewing experience."],["The Broadway Melody Of 1929 scored a coup at the box office; it was also the first \"talkie\" to receive the Oscar for Best Picture. This incredible film was very modern for its time even though the story today would never suffice as a movie plot. The acting is convincing; Bessie Love and Anita Page shine as the sister act Hank and Queenie Mahoney. Just one look at Charles King as Eddie Kearns tells you he's the good guy who can't help being human; and Kenneth Thomson turns in an excellent performance as the rich playboy Jacques Warriner. Arthur Freed himself gets a small role as a bystander in the rehearsal room for Francis Zanfield's latest Broadway production. Clearly the character of Francis Zanfield refers to the great Flo Ziegfeld--excellent!The movie opens with sisters Hank and Queenie arriving in New York to seek fortune and fame as a Broadway act. They talk it over with Eddie, who loves Hank until he gets a glimpse of Queenie now that she's \"all grown up.\" Eddie tries to get the sisters into the latest Broadway revue production staged by Francis Zanfield. Things begin to happen both for the better and for the worse as Eddie realizes that he loves Queenie and not Hank anymore. Queenie tries to escape Eddie by dating a rich playboy named Jacques so that Hank, her sister, could be happy with Eddie. However, Jacques' money may not be enough to win Queenie's true love. Queenie must then decide between Eddie and Jacques; and her decision effects Hank's life, too.The shades of black and white complement the fine acting perfectly; and the superb musical numbers strike you as infectious even today. The movie score boasts the infectiously happy \"The Broadway Melody;\" \"You Were Meant For Me\" and \"Truthful Parson Brown.\" These numbers are sung with the great sensitivity you expect from a MGM musical and the musical arrangements reflect forethought, too.The cinematography is quite good for it's time. The opening moments feature beautiful aerial views of Manhattan; the lighting is good and the subjects are well framed within the screen. You get excellent sound and the strength of the choreography shows in the dancer numbers as well as the brief fight scene between Eddie and Jacques.The DVD offers wonderful extras, too. MGM spoofs its own movie with \"The Dogway Melody.\" The trained dogs act out a story that is remarkably similar to The Broadway Melody of 1929--excellent! There are five \"Metro Movietone Revues,\" too, which showcase other talented acts in the form of short movies. Van & Schenck get to display their talents in their own musical revue as well.As for Broadway Melody itself, sure, the plot might be corny, contrived and predictable--but, then again, who cares? These characters show their human sides well through fine acting and the musical numbers exceed your expectations. The movie holds your attention throughout and the themes of love, humanity and wanting success will remain forever relevant to us both today and in the future. Kudos to MGM and these superb actors for producing such a treat as The Broadway Melody of 1929! Great job, everyone!"],["The storyline here is as cliche-ridden a backstage expose as Showgirls would be 70 years later. Eddie, a song-and-dance man, sells one of his tunes to the \"Zanfeld Dollies\" (a very thinly disguised Ziegfeld Follies) and invites his long-distance girlfriend - now touring the country in a second-rate sister act - to come to New York and share his Broadway good fortune. When the sisters arrive, Eddie, who hasn't seen the kid sister since she was, well, a kid, falls head-over-heels for the grown-up version. Eddie is really one of the most despicable heroes in all of musicals. Oh yeah, this is a musical, and while, a year or two later, MGM would be mounting fantastically lavish production numbers, the musical numbers in this primitive effort are almost hysterically bad, featuring hoofer ballerinas and dancing girls hopping on one leg in front of cardboard sets.

Everyone agrees the music is good (\"No skies of gray on the Great White Way / That's the Broadway melody\"), but the reviews I found trash most of the rest of it. I agree the film isn't a classic, but without it there could have been no \"42nd Street,\" \"All About Eve,\" \"Cabaret\" or \"Chicago.\" In these films, actors' lives take a backseat to their professional work. Bessie Love's lead performance is heartbreaking; she keeps going after losing her sister & future husband to one another. Gay themes include a swishy costumer played for laughs, & a relationship between the sisters that verges on incest.

I found the Metro Movietones selected for inclusion to be extremely odd and below average compared to others that exist. This includes \"Dogway Melody.\" If Warner Home Video had only chosen SONGWRITERS' REVUE (1929) to the exclusion of all else, viewers would be treated to a 35-year old Jack Benny introducing songwriting teams of the day playing and singing their own material--this includes Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed themselves, with Freed singing \"Wedding of the Painted Doll.\" This would have been the perfect extra for this DVD edition. Warner also might have considered lifting song numbers from HOLLYWOOD REVUE OF 1929 for inclusion, particularly the first film production number of \"Singin' in the Rain.\" However, I personally will never settle for anything less than a complete edition of the latter on DVD. HOLLYWOOD REVUE OF 1929 remains the only one of the star-studded studio revues in which all reels survive. It is also the only one in which all reels survive in beautiful condition--in this case 13 reels. Other studio revues boasted color sequences. MGM's HOLLYWOOD REVUE is the only one in which all it's color sequences survive with their color intact---not black and white copies. Anyone wishing details on these all-star revues may contact me. I have gathered quite a lot of information.Back to BROADWAY MELODY. I wonder how many have noticed that the print used for the DVD is different from the one used for the VHS edition, and possibly edited. This is really quite clear. I had noted another Amazon.com reviewer's comment on the graininess of the DVD release before I purchased and viewed mine only two days ago. This is true. The only other major difference that I noticed was in the very beginning, during the opening credits. In the VHS edition, the strains of \"The Broadway Melody\" are heard over the entire opening credits. The credits dissolve as George M. Cohan's \"Give My Regards to Broadway\" begins, and that accompanies the shots of the city. In the DVD edition, only the latter part of the \"The Broadway Melody\" music is used, and is replaced by the Cohan song before the credits are half over. During the overhead shots of the city the sound of an automobile horn has been dubbed in. This is nowhere to be heard in the VHS version. Between the DVD and VHS editions, I suppose the jury is still out on which is the better print."],["This was one of the first movie musicals.

In fact it's down right hoaky. At best, it's a time capsule best explained by the footnoted commentary of Frank Sinatra in the original \"That's Entertainment!\" anthology film. There Sinatra comments that the film \"may not tell you where our heads were at, but it certainly tells you where our hearts were at.\" Anita Paige and Bessie Love as Queenie and Hank Mahoney are a couple of starry-eyed dreamers in a \"hey kids, let's put on a show\" yarn that by now is tired and old hat. But at the time, MGM's \"The Broadway Melody\" was the first of the big brassy musicals to boast \"100% All Talking! All Singing! All Dancing!\" - thanks to that new fandangled sound system that had been previously introduced in portions of Warner's \"The Jazz Singer.\"The maudlin story, even by 1929 standards, has Queenie and Hank take to the great white way during the twenties and...stop me if I'm spoiling this one for you... they make it big in showbiz! Lest we forget that this was the decade when a gal could become Broadway's newest and hottest property simply by standing on a pedestal or staircase. In this case the chorus girls are fat; chunky little vixens with more sass than class, and the crooners belong on street corners - not film. But it's the cavalcade of Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown songs that continue to sell this stinker, including \"You Were Meant for Me\" and, of course \"The Broadway Melody\" - sung with genuine epileptic enegy by Charles King. Both tunes would subsequently turn up in MGM's \"Singin' In The Rain\" to much better effect three decades later.The dramatic weight of this drawn out melodrama in melody is left in the hands of silent starlet, Bessie Love - who gets remarkable mileage out of predictable material and was even Oscar-nominated for her efforts. What is particularly disappointing about \"The Broadway Melody\" is director, Harry Beaumont's flat camera handling of the musical sequences. There's no spark and no energy in their staging. Instead we are treated to a series of rigidly flat and one dimensional spectacles of kitsch and coo buttressed by some genuinely painful performances that, in retrospect, belong on the cutting room floor. Today \"The Broadway Melody\" is best left as a museum piece to those in film school who will rediscover and acknowledge it as the primitive prototype for the glory and the ecstasy that was to become the MGM musical during the late thirties and beyond.Warner's DVD is just middle of the road. The image quality is considerably dated and, at times, poorly contrasted. Scratches, chips and tears are present throughout. The Gray scale is poorly rendered with considerable grain and heavy shimmering throughout. At times the image almost gets to a place where one can sit back and sort of try to enjoy the film for what it is, but it just as quickly degenerates into a muddy mess of weak blacks and not very clean whites. The audio exhibits remarkable clarity for a film of this vintage - the result of at least some minor clean up and restoration.

My ONLY negative for this DVD is that you don't have an option to watch a full, uncut version.  Not that big of a deal though.There's also an early set Louie did in '95 at the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival in Apsen -- Young Comedians Special -- that's about 20-30 minutes itself.  It's interesting to see how his act and stage presence has evolved.

Great performances and wonderful cameos by some legendary performers.A welcome addition to my collection."],["Excellent comedy would recommend this movie to anyone. If one is looking for some old fashion humour this is it"],["After Sidney Poitier proved himself time and again as one of the more accomplished actors of his time in such dramatic films as A Raisin in the Sun (1961), In the Heat of the Night (1967), and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967), he tried his hand at comedies, which he not only directed, but also starred in with funny man Bill Cosby, who, at the time, established himself in television series like \"I Spy\", \"The Bill Cosby Show\", and \"Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids\". The result was a trio of films, this one titled Uptown Saturday Night (1974) being the first (and most popular), with Let's Do It Again (1975) and A Piece of the Action (1977) to follow. Also appearing is singer Harry Belafonte (Island in the Sun), Rosalind Cash (The Omega Man), Roscoe Lee Browne (Topaz, Super Fly T.N.T.), Paula Kelly (Soylent Green), Harold Nicholas (The Five Heartbeats), Calvin Lockhart (Let's Do It Again), Flip Wilson (\"Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In\"), and the late, great Richard Pryor (Car Wash, Silver Streak), in a small role as private detective Sharp Eye Washington, a part Bill Cosby was originally interested in playing.Sidney Poitier and Bill Cosby are Steve Jackson and Wardell Franklin, respectively, a pair of working class stiffs (Steve works in a mill, while Wardell drives a cab), looking to get a piece of the action...er, wait, that's the title of their third film...anyway, one night, the two men decide to visit an `after hours' club, essentially an exclusive nightclub featuring illegal gambling, called Zenobia's. The place is jumping, full of fly guys, foxy mamas, and hot, funky music...and gambling. Just as the pair hits it big on the dice table, a gang of masked gunmen raid the joint, robbing the place blind. The next day Steve discovers he's won $50,000 dollars in the lottery, but guess what? The winning ticket was in his wallet, which was taken during the heist. Steve and Wardell hit the streets in an effort to find the persons responsible for the robbery, and hopefully, recover the winning ticket, and exercise which has them come into contact with all sorts of underworld types, including a pint-sized karate expert named Little Seymour (Nicholas), a smooth hustler named Silky Slim who's looking to make a name for himself, and an established crime kingpin named Geechie Dan Beauford (Belafonte). Eventually Steve and Wardell do find out who was responsible fir hitting Zenobia's, and concoct a crazy scheme involving setting the crooks up to steal non-existent diamonds, all in an effort not only recover Steve's wallet (with the winning ticket), but also to jam up the gangsters with whom the pair are now in hot water with, culminating in an outlandish finale at a church picnic.While Uptown Saturday Night was the most popular of the trio of comedies Poitier and Cosby did in the 1970s, I always thought their second feature, Let's Do It Again (1975), was actually the funniest of the three. That's not to say the other two aren't funny, as they most certainly are, but the second always seemed to stand out as the best, in my opinion. This film works for a number of reason...the story is relatively solid, the script sharp, the direction highly professional, the cast exceptionally talented (the writer states he originally wrote the film with Redd Foxx and Richard Pryor in mind to play the leads, but Poitier and Cosby were chosen instead because of their ability to generate box office sales), and finally just by the fact the filmmakers allowed enough leeway for Cosby to do a lot of what he does best, and that is improvise, as shown in some of the funniest scenes in the film, of which there are many. Watch as Cosby takes it over the top near the beginning, during the gambling sequence where he's actually winning as a female patron has the hot hand with the dice...and then there's the bit where Cosby and Poitier's characters are trying to act all tough as they enter a bar known to be a hangout for a criminal which they got a tip on...this is followed up by Cosby producing the most cockamamie line of BS as the pair find themselves in over their heads. In this particular scene, the writer mentioned in a featurette on the DVD that the boys were supposed to run out of the bar when it appeared they were going to get the beating, but then the scene was changed to allow Cosby to try and schmooze his way out of the sticky situation to no avail as the pair eventually get the beating in a hilarious fight sequence. Also, I think Bill Cosby's ratty beard should have gotten its own credit in the film, as it was almost a character unto itself...and who knew Sidney Poitier could pull off a comic role as well as he does? Sure, most of the time he was more or less the straight man, setting Cosby up, but still, he had his moments. I guess an excellent actor can perform well in any genre, given the material is there. I'll tell you what, had I not seen Harry Belafonte credited as playing the character of Geechie Dan Beauford, a comical representation of Marlon Brando's portrayal of Don Vito Corleone, I wouldn't have recognized him at all. And then there's Flip Wilson, as `The Reverend'...he's got some great lines, the best being while he's preaching to his congregation...\"Friends, we need more romance and less hot pants!\" Richard Pryor also has a small, but funny, role as a nervous private eye Poitier and Cosby's characters seek out to help recover the wallet. He's got a couple of great lines with regards to how African American private eyes are portrayed on screen versus reality. All in all, this is a solidly funny film, with a lot of crazy characters, quotable lines, and funky 1970s fashions and hairstyles (check out Bill Cosby's afro, complete with a part down the middle).The anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1), looks very good here, given the age of the film. It doesn't leap out at you, but probably looks as good as when it was originally released. As far as the Dolby Digital mono audio, I have no complaints. In terms of extras, there are a few, including an audio commentary track featuring Dr. Todd Boyd, USC professor of cinema and television and author, a short featurette titled The Lowdown on Uptown: A Retrospective (7:06), and a theatrical trailer. If you liked this film, I would suggest checking out the two films that followed, Let's Do It Again (1975) and A Piece of the Action (1977). The movies aren't actually sequels, so the order in which you watch them isn't really important.Cookieman108By the way, as I write this, I noticed Warner Home Video, the studio that owns the film, is planning on re-releasing this movie onto DVD as a double feature with A Piece of the Action (1977), at a very attractive price. If you're interested, it might be worth it to look for that release rather than buy this stand alone version."],["This was Sidney Poitier's first real try at comedy, and it was great.  He and Bill Cosby began a good partnership."],["I also sent this along with a few other DVDs to my Uncle for his 76th birthday.  This is one of my favs and surely one of his.

A must have for your 1970's film collection."],["You can debate the significance of \"Uptown Saturday Night\" in terms of it's place in African-American cinema but there is no debating that this film is just plain fun first frame to last.  Director-star Sidney Poitier, who subsequently proved himself an adept comedy director with \"Stir Crazy\", is essentially a straight man to the assembled talent on hand here.  But what talent it is!  The plot essentially centers around working class Steve(Poitier) and his fast talking buddy Wardell(Bill Cosby) trying to recover a wallet containing a winning lottery ticket that was stolen during a hold-up at a swanky after-hours club.  The plot takes a back seat to the comic vignettes that follow.  Cosby is smooth as Wardell.  Richard Pryor nearly steals the film in his one scene as private detective Sharp Eye Washington.  A nearly unrecognizable Harry Belafonte in a spot-on \"Godfather\" spoof is hilarious as Geechy Dan.  Roscoe Lee Browne has a terrific bit as a doublespeaking Congressman.  Paula Kelly is deliciously brassy as Leggy Peggy.  Calvin Lockhart exudes menace as Silky Slim.  In a curious bit, Flip Wilson plays it straightforward as the Reverend.  Some thirty years on this film holds up remarkably well which should qualify it for classic status."],["This film with have you laughing the whole time.  Good family fun!!!  Love the 70s!!  Also, enjoyed the church scene with Filp Wilson!"],["Love this movie, and wish I could find other old movies just like it.

I watched it as well and it brought back so many memories!"],["A stone cold classic from the 70's era, top notch rollercoaster ride from start to finish.  crosby and pointtier is at their best"],["It shouldn't surprise anyone that UPTOWN SATURDAY NIGHT doesn't really hold up as a contemporary picture. Doesn't mean it's not a good and funny film, but you've got to take in the context and the period and the 1970s culture, and specifically the 1970s black culture. This movie showcases an amazing cast, a roster full of what back then constituted big names in the film industry. Being an old fogey, I checked this out back in the day, in the 1980s when I was a kid, and back then I thought it was great. Nowadays, I still think it's great. It's a treat watching Poitier and Cosby (but mostly Cosby) front and jive and hustle. Yeah, this sucker's dated, but it comes with a ton of quotable lines. \"Nobody loud talks Little Seymour.\" \"There will be no joy juice allowed.\" Etc.The plot fixates on two blue-collar fellas caught in the wrong place, in the wrong time. Saturday night and it's all right, and straight arrow Steve Jackson (Poitier) and fast-talking Wardell Franklin (Cosby) sneak away from their wives to check out the exclusive and happenin' after-hours nightclub Zenobia, something which they'll come to regret. Especially when four masked robbers storm Zenobia and hold up the place. The next day, flipping thru the newspaper, Steve realizes that his wallet - confiscated by the bandits - contains a winning lottery ticket with a $50,000 pay-off. So it's on, as Steve and Wardell desperately canvas the city's seedier joints on the trail of that lottery ticket. Follows a series of episodic scenes as our two leads bump into one colorful character after another. This, by the way, eventually leads us to a classic and hilarious barroom shakedown, this scene shot years before Eddie Murphy would do his bar bit in 48 HOURS (except that, okay, Reggie Hammond actually got the result he wanted).UPTOWN SATURDAY NIGHT is the first in a trilogy of successful buddy comedy flicks teaming up Sidney Poitier and Bill Cosby. That the movie works is largely because of the comic interplay between these two stars. Poitier, who also directs the thing and acts as the straight man in this tandem, allows the Coz to riff and bring the energy and the flavor. Bill Cosby, performance-wise, basically drives the film. Folks who've only ever seen Cosby as Heathcliff Huxtable may be in for a startlement. Cosby's character in UPTOWN SATUDAY NIGHT isn't clean-cut and square and homogenized. His Wardell Franklin rocks that nappy 'fro and that bushy beard and, man, is his wardrobe colorful. His facial expressions are priceless, Cosby able to convey a slew of emotions with simply a half-smile or a mere pointed glance or two. His character also effortlessly lies at the drop of the hat, and it's a pleasure when his fast-talking embellishments become these extended, tangled bits of dialogue.This was made during the heyday of the black exploitation flicks, when cool cats like Shaft and Superfly ran this mutha. UPTOWN SATURDAY NIGHT certainly took advantage of this cinematic trend. Scenes are inhabited by hoods and hooligans, gangsters and jive turkeys, and the screenplay maneuvers our two semi-bumbling hustlers in and out of this shady environment, vernacular flying fast and loose, various outrageous wardrobes threatening to clash.Flip Wilson's reverend is the only character I wasn't into, his sermon going on and on and forever to a day. Everyone else rocks it well.  Harry Belafonte as mob boss Geechie Dan Beauford does a nice riff on Don Corleone, complete with cotton in cheek. Roscoe Lee Browne plays a black congressman who sometimes (depending on his audience) dons a dashiki, and this congressman certainly knows which side of his bread is buttered (apparently, it's both sides). Diminutive Harold Nicholas (of the terrific early century dance duo, the Nicholas Brothers) made milk snort out my nose when he popped in as Little Seymour and proceeded to kick the what out of Cosby and Poitier. \"Here's a little somethin' for n------ who loud talk Little Seymour.\" Take that.But you have to give it up for Richard Pryor as skittish shamus Sharp Eye Washington. Hands down, he's got the best cameo in this flick.The DVD's bonus features include an entertaining track commentary and perspective by Dr. Todd Boyd, USC professor of cinema & television and author if AM I BLACK ENOUGH FOR YOU: POPULAR CULTURE FROM THE 'HOOD AND BEYOND; \"The Lowdown on Uptown,\" the 7-minute retrospective; and the theatrical trailer."],["This is a classic film. This film has good actors. Funny funny funny movie. Can't compare this movie. Its one of the best"],["Uptown Saturday Night was one of the first films I looked for when I acquired a DVD player a few years ago.  Finally it is available.  Nonetheless, one of the major reasons I purchase DVDs is to ascertain what extras and supplements might be included to complement the film itself.  I was a little disappointed with what Warner Bros included as &quot;Special Features&quot; for this great film.  The commentary by Dr. Todd Boyd is insightful in accurately setting this film in its proper social, cultural, historical context.  However Boyd's commentary provides little insight into the making of the movie, the depth of its actors, and behind the scenes dynamics that went into making the film.  Like so much commentary available on DVD &quot;extras&quot;, Boyd's comments do nothing more than provide a cheering section to the film (i.e. this is a classic scene,  I loved this scene, etc.).  It would have been nice to have had more input from Richard Wesley who wrote the screenplay, Sidney Poitier who directed and starred in the film, as well as comments from Bill Cosby who is the key comedic figure in this caper film.I was also disappointed in the &quot;documentary&quot; included as a &quot;Special Feature&quot; entitled &quot;The Lowdown on Uptown: A Retrospective&quot;.  This &quot;lowdown&quot; is a little too brief and even suffers from false advertisement.  On the back of the DVD package, the consumer is led to believe that this retrospective would include comments by Denise Nicholas and Jimmie Walker.  I saw or heard nothing from either of them.  Again where was Poitier, where was Cosby?Enough complaints however because this is one of my favorite films of all time.  I particularly like the character roles of Roscoe Lee Browne, Richard Pryor, and Flip Wilson.  The film also includes great displays of the lives and concerns of Black folk in the mid 1970s.  All I have to say as with all DVDs ... bring on more &quot;special features&quot; and &quot;extras&quot;."],["This is a kind of film that people like to keep around. It's not Shakespeare but it's fun and light and it features some pretty wonderful performances. In here we have Steve Jackson (Sidney Poitier) and Wardell Franklin (Bill Cosby) are two working stiffs looking to have a good time uptown.  They tip out on wives Sarah Jackson (Rosalind Cash) and Irma Franklin (Ketty Lester) and go to Zenobia's, a joint - named after Madame Zenobia (Lee Chamberlin) - where the high fallutin' high rollers hang out for a little casino action.Unfortunately, they lose their shirts (literally) when robbers force them and everyone else to strip and give up their valuables. Thugs Zenobia's not only take all the patron's money and jewels, but also Steve's wallet, which he later discovers held something more valuable than he ever imagined.  Steve and Wardell seek the help of numerous neighborhood characters - including \"Don\" Geechie Dan Beauford (Harry Belafonte), The Don's rival Silky Slim (Calvin Lockhart), local hood Little Seymour (Harold Nicholas), inept private investigator Sharp Eye Washington (Richard Pryor), and a corrupt Congress-critter (Roscoe Lee Browne) - in retrieving the wallet.Uptown Saturday Night is a special movie, capable of striking that delicate balance between not funny and not interesting. It is, however, not to be dismissed out-of-hand. The film is a visual treat, to be sure. Cosby parting his hair and his moustache for a big night out on the town is truly a sight to behold, as is the red piping on his dinner jacket. He's also pretty tough in this movie. Cosby's Wardell is a little less refined than his I Spy guy, and a lot less refined than his ugly sweater Huxtable. Comedic co-star, Sidney Poitier looked to be out of his field, especially compared to Bill \"Shave And A Haircut?\" Cosby and the rest of the crew.  Much of the time, Poitier seemed to be barely hanging in there, trying to keep up with Cosby's antics, with a look of terror in his eyes whenever Cosby tore loose (though admittedly, that may have been Director Poitier, panicking over losing control of Cosby).  But even Cosby himself took a back seat to Paula Kelly, Richard Pryor, and Roscoe Lee Browne. Kelly, who I loved in \"Sweet Charity\", was Large as Leggy Peggy without being unnecessarily Loud; Pryor was understated (for him), and had one of the best, spot-on, lines in the movie; and Browne wore his two-faced Afro [when it suited him]-American [when it didn't] politician role like a shining coat of armor. The real surprise for me was discovering that Harry Belafonte was one of the bad guys (\"Geechie Dan\"). One hopes he was wearing alot of makeup, because otherwise, he looks close to death. Overall it's a goo/decent film that I recommended to  all Bill Cosby/Sidney Poitier fans, or anyone looking for a decent classic movie to watch, may want to pick \"Uptown Saturday Night.\""],["Very funny and most enjoyable.

I'm being facetious, obviously I've seen him in earlier works, most notably the tv series \"I Spy\". But there's an amazing energy, a youthful exuberance to his performance as taxi cab driver and general troublemaker Wardell Franklin. It was like seeing a different person, a completely unknown actor remarkably more dubious  and devious than the one most remember in 'The Cosby Show' or hawking Jell-O Pudding. The 'everyman dad' is gratefully non-existent in this vibrant hip performance.And even Sidney Poitier metaphorically let his hair down by embracing his comical persona, Steve Jackson, a blue-collar factory worker who loses a winning lottery ticket to a bunch of thieves. And if it were a straight mugging - all would be forgiven. But in 'Uptown' our man loses said ticket while sneaking away from his wife and kids to go party at an illegal underground hotspot of drinking, gambling and cavorting with women of the night. There isn't going to be a police report. He and Cosby are on their own.Kind of wish Poitier had done more comedies like this. And likewise, I wish Cosby had done more 'street' roles and delivered less of the erudite professional.And I can't praise to Harry \"Geechie Dan\" Belafonte enough. The true test of any actor: Can you completely become someone else? Can you submerge your own persona so deeply that no one recognizes you? Honestly had *no* idea Geechie Dan was in fact Belafonte until the credits rolled. And he's sooooo funny! Definitely my all-time favorite performance of the actor.This production was a ton of fun, immensely enjoyable and easily explains why the pair did two more buddy-buddy movies within an amazingly brief three-year span: 'Let's Do It Again' and 'A Piece of the Action'.Still, trying to recapture lightning in a bottle rarely works. And having screened both follow-up films, I have to say that they really couldn't top this initial production for pure panache, energy, style and laughter.Poitier and Cosby really led what can honestly be called an 'all-star cast' with the likes of Roscoe Lee Browne, Paula Kelly, Calvin Lockhart, Flip Wilson and in a small, but insanely funny, cameo role: Richard Pryor as con-man \"Sharp Eye Washington\" - loved the handwritten cardboard signs! :-DAnd boy, we could really use Pryor today in 2011. He would tear this ridiculously twisted politically-correct world a couple of new holes and knock it down a few notches from it's holier-than-thou pedestal. I thought Chris Rock might lead the charge, but I'm sadden to see him knuckle under to the P.C. Police.Fun enjoyable comedy that stands the test of time."],["I love this picture, reminds me of good times in my life, funny and clean,the way people use to act, and had fun with it, very less shootin, thats the way it was back in the 70s and some 80s sidney and crosby very funny"],["This script is fun, made even more so by the Who's Who cast (even Flip Wilson!) and the allusion the Godfather movies.

Everyone in this movie will have you busting your gut laughing. Bunch of fools (but in a funny way). I guess when you lose a lotto ticket, you go thru a lot trying to get it back. But if these clowns had been where they were supposed to be, instead of partying up at Zenobia's, they wouldn't have found themselves in such a mess. I guess they thought the wives wouldn't know they'd been up to no good.They went from getting robbed, to get beaten up by a 4 foot 10 guy, to getting hooked up with some gangsters to ending up jumping into the river all because they were hard-headed.

It's certainly not a bad one; the dialogue just seems a bit stilted and overly dramatic at times.  In lesser hands, this would've been stuffed on a back shelf awhile ago.  Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn are extremely talented, though, both alone and as a team, so the end result is a cheerful, electric little romantic comedy.  The subject matter -wife has more prestigious job than husband- is actually rather controversial for its time (I wonder how the ending would have changed if it was remade now).

They were never hotter than in this, their maiden effort. It's a classic Boy Meets Girl tale, Tracy/Hepburn style.Tracy's sports' writer, Sam, is salt-of-the-earth, gruff yet tender. He only has eyes for Tess, a political pundit, who is worldly and confidant, clearly the center of her own universe. This is a problem when they attempt marriage. Tess harbors a refugee on their wedding night, spends oodles of time with her obnoxious secretary, unilaterally adopts an orphan, and generally louses things up. Sam fumes, but lets her get away with it because he loves her. The affection between these two is obvious (and very hot) whether they're canoodling on a couch or breaking up. The way their early encounters were shot is suprisingly erotic, even today. We all know life was imitating art, and it's a joy to watch. Check out how Spence eyesexes Kate upon their first meeting in the office, as delicious a moment as was ever put on film.It's the little things that make this movie work, the blink-and-you-miss-them-moments. Tess, whose world has been thoroughly rocked, walks into the doorframe after the first kiss in the airport. Sam peers around the aunt to catch one last look at Tess as she departs for the plane.

Between Katherine Hepburn's purring delivery of her lines and Spencer Tracy's staunch presence, the two had a very special thing going on.  Sam Craig (Spencer Tracy) and Tess Harding (Katherine Hepburn) are a pair of rivaling journalists who end up falling for each other.  Tess is a die hard feminist and she proves to be too much for Sam to handle, at times.  So much so that her strong convictions put their relationship on the line.What works so well, here, is the combination of human drama and warm humor.  You also feel the true (and believable) love between the couple and it doesn't feel so much as a movie as a tribute to the relationship of two incomparable actors.  For more great Tracy and Hepburn films, I reccomend that you see ADAM'S RIB, GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER, and PAT & MIKE."],["Katharine Hepburn already established the headstrong aspect of her screen persona in 1938's \"Holiday\" and 1940's \"The Philadelphia Story\", but she adds a worldly intellect and a beguiling sexual ardor that prove most fetching in her portrayal of multilingual political journalist Tess Harding in this 1942 film classic. In her first teaming with lifelong off-screen partner Spencer Tracy, she sets off palpable sparks with the normally taciturn actor, who plays sportswriter Sam Craig working at the same newspaper. Written by Ring Lardner Jr. and Michael Kanin, the plot is about the characters' whirlwind courtship from an immediate sexual attraction to an impulsive marriage, all the while struggling with each other's priorities. Needless to say, given that it's a product of its era, it becomes a matter of time before Tess bends to Sam's will but not until some intriguing observations are made about sex roles in a basically fractious relationship.However, rather than the comic fireworks generated by their later collaboration, 1949's \"Adam's Rib\", this film treads in unexpectedly sentimental melodrama, especially in the episodes where Tess has to let go of a Greek orphan she wants to adopt and in the climactic scene when she tearfully recognizes her wifely responsibilities as her aunt Ellen marries her father. Still, the pair's familiar bantering occurs when Sam explains the rules of baseball to Tess and in the final feminist reversal as she fails miserably in her attempt at domesticity. George Stevens directed the film, and he displays his sure hand with actors and an acute sense of craftsmanship throughout. Intriguingly, for a Tracy-Hepburn vehicle, it feels much more like her movie than his, and consequently their rapport is not quite up to their normal standard here. The supporting characters also feel more incidental here, even though Fay Bainter shines briefly as Ellen. It's not my favorite of their films together, but it is certainly required viewing for their fans. There are no extras with the 2000 DVD."],["Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy team up for their first of about nine films in a wonderful story about a sports writer, Spencer Tracy, who falls for his lovely and intelligent co-worker, Hepburn.  The drama unfolds as the two get married but Hepburn's character sometimes forgets to make room in her life for her new husband.  This film is one of the best of the pair's films and should be amoung those that should be seen by all people from every generation.  Truly a timeless classic."],["WOMAN OF THE YEAR stars Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn in their first film together, his Sam Craig matched with her Tess Harding; his subtle, underplaying acting style with her stylised, personality-driven performance. It's an acting tour de force, to be sure--the two of them make the best of (and often far surpass) a somewhat limited script and interesting but stiffly played-out plot. In fact, their chemistry in this film is palpable. When someone speaks of cinematic magic, of chemistry sparking off (if not engulfing) the screen, *this*--Tracy, Hepburn, Tracy and Hepburn--is what they are talking about, even back in the days of the Hays Code. It's all mostly chaste kisses and long eye contact, often carried out in semi-darkness, and yet the two main players establish a relationship more sexual and believable than so many of the relationships portrayed in films these days. (Take the tiny moment in the cab--not the drunk scene that everyone loves, but that moment when he says, \"I've got to get something off my chest\", and she mumbles, \"I'm too heavy\", and raises her head. When he gently pulls it back to where you feel it would always belong, you know that these actors are doing something incredible.)This isn't to say that the film is without flaws. Far from it. The writing is clipped and most of the words on their own have little spark. (It takes Spencer Tracy's glowering eyes, or Katharine Hepburn's radiant smile, to add life to those words.) Even the relationship between Sam and Tess isn't set up in the most fluid of ways, leap-frogging from moment to moment, from scene to scene, without quite making the necessary connections--if you believe in Sam and Tess together (and I do), it's only because you can truly believe in Tracy and Hepburn together. The film occasionally feels like a play cobbled together from various scenes, until it hits its stride midway through the film (after Sam and Tess get married).Script aside, the plot is interesting, and certainly quite radical for its time. However, the ending (a hilarious set-piece of comedy though it might be) leaves things largely unresolved. We have a wonderful, strong female character in Tess Harding--this is clear enough in the first half of the film. But her strength, her forceful personality and go-getting attitude, become her weakness in the second half, so much so that she becomes almost a caricature of the original Tess Harding. Some of the things she does (her 'humanitarian' wholesale adoption of Chris, for example; her rudeness and blithe ignorance of Sam's worth) are truly reprehensible, and the point the writers are making is clear--a female who tries too hard to be a male loses her feminity, and cannot ever really be fulfilled. In this sense, the gender politics, as other commenters have pointed out, is 'deplorable'.And yet there is a grain of truth in it; if one *can* be brought to believe that Tess could really treat Chris and Sam in the way she does, one can't help but applaud Sam's decision to leave. The role reversal is almost complete--Sam himself comments on the fact that she 'makes love' to him to smooth over their quarrels. She charges on her own merry way without asking him about his life, his opinion, or anything that remotely matters to him. Their union was neither perfect, nor a marriage, as he justifiably charges.The uneasy tension between the admirable and the deplorable Tess Hardings comes at the end: you most certainly get the impression that the film itself didn't quite know whether or not to affirm the Tess character. In fact, by all accounts (even Hepburn's own), the film originally ended with an unqualified affirmation of Tess's character--promising to be more involved in her husband's life, Tess is depicted at a baseball game, cheering alongside Sam, getting louder and louder and rising higher in her seat above him. It was both an affirmation of Tess the character, and a lingering question mark about the Harding-Craig reunion.Test audiences didn't like it. (Apparently, it was the *women* who felt threatened by the character Hepburn portrayed on screen. She was too strong, too beautiful, too *everything* all at once.)What transpired in the end, then, was a re-shot ending that muddied the moral of the film in suggesting that women could not really be fulfilled without their men. Sam wants her to be Tess Harding Craig; she wants to be Mrs. Craig; she wants to change; he thinks (and probably knows) she can't. The logical ending would have seen Tess, cast as she had been in the traditional masculine role, wooing Sam back, only to cast doubt over whether her atypical (for the time) strength as a female would unequivocally threaten the typical male figure as embodied in Tracy's character. The original ending would have better borne out the logic of the film--a valuable DVD extra if ever there was one. You can perhaps applaud the spirit of the film, without accepting the fact that it seems to let that spirit fade away in the end.So what is there of worth in WOMAN OF THE YEAR, with its original ending gone, and its revolutionary potential muted by a slapstick scene in a kitchen with exploding waffles, too much coffee, and a woman who just can't seem to figure out how to separate eggs? Well, the answer is simple, and it's already been given. This is a movie to watch, and to watch *again*, because it is the first cinematic pairing of Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. For a couple of hours, you're allowed to watch these two great, mythical actors playing two people in love... while falling in love themselves. That is most certainly a rare privilege, if ever there was one."],["Audrey Hepburn didn't disappoint as a brilliant female journalist in the 1940's attempting to juggle a vibrant career and marriage."],["Everything you've heard about WOMAN OF THE YEAR is true.  This was the first pairing of Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, and, yes, the chemistry IS evident.  Michael Kanin and Ring Lardner's script is intelligent and the dialogue is snappy for the most part.  It does touch lightly on \"issues of the day\" (the war, obviously--and of course, the proverbial \"battle of the sexes,\" the subtext of just about EVERY Tracy-Hepburn film ever made).  And,yes, the baseball scene is pretty darn great.But the film is not an unqualified success.  The kitchen disaster scene towards the movie's end is cliched and just too darn slow.  The flying toast, the boiling over coffee and that cussed watched pot that keeps boiling over are enough to try the patience of almost any contemporary viewer.  Tracy is consigned to shameless mugging throughout the entire proceedings.  Probably not his fault.  I'm sure he was dutifully taking direction.  But director George Stephens' sense of pacing--so effective in the baseball scene--fails him here.The entire scene seems lifted from a THREE STOOGES short and is totally out of place with the sophisticated tone of the rest of the film.Many have pointed out that the shift from breezy comedy to near-melodrama is a bit jarring at times.  I would have to say that the writers deserve some credit for making the script a bit more nuanced than it might have been otherwise.  Hepburn's change-of-heart at her father's wedding is not entirely convincing, but interestingly enough Tracy is not entirely convinced either.  He calls her out on this very point.  Is it a true change of heart or merely another of her many self-dramatizing whims?And speaking of whims, am I the only viewer who found the segment with Chris, the young Greek orphan, kind of disturbing?  That Kate's ambitious Tess Harding character would feel almost obliged to adopt a young refugee (and foist the child on her unsuspecting husband) is dubious enough.  That she would neglect him on top of that, however, risks making her once charmingly eccentric character almost monstrous.In fact, I kept wondering about the kid even after the big reconciliation scene between the principles.  Did anyone think about going back to the orphanage and fetching the youngster and maybe starting a \"real\" family.  By the film's end, you feel that Sam and Tess Harding Craig are coming to terms with themselves and their marriage.  They get to start anew,and you're glad for them.  But what about that poor kid?"],["It's nice to see this couple in a movie that is similar to  true life they share.

Lardner Jr was, to his credit,  a gifted writer, having won the Oscar for this film along with MASH in 1970.Lardner read Woman of the Year's original, more feminist, ending at a meeting of the New York City literary group, the Writer's Voice.

It's the first pairing of the legendary Hepburn and Tracy, and from the moment when he first sets his eyes on her (actually, her legs - a great shot!), you can feel why they were such a perfect match on screen.  They star as newspaper columnists coming from different backgrounds and perspectives, who despite the odds, fall in love, even though they have no idea how to fit into each other's worlds.  Both stars give their usual top performances, compensating for some slow parts and dated elements in the story.  I enjoyed the film, as I have enjoyed all their films that I have seen.  Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy were two of the best in the business, so any opportunity to see them together should be taken!"],["Sam Craig (Spencer Tracy) works as a sports writer at the New York Chronicle. Overall he's a solid, unflappable fellow, but when he hears international columnist Tess Harding (Katherine Hepburn) support the abolition of baseball during wartime, he can't resist retaliating in print. The battle is soon joined, and it's not long before the editor calls them together for a cease-fire. One look at Tess, though, and Sam is a goner. Their mutual attraction can't be denied, and it's not long before they're married.But what is Sam in for? Tess' career has a life of its own, and he can barely get a moment with her alone. Most of the time, he's trailing in her wake along with countless diplomats, refugees and other international figures. While Sam is successful at his work, it's a world Tess has little time for - and it's not long before the relationship feels the strain.\"Woman of the Year\" happily manages to avoid many of the pitfalls inherent in stories focused on sexual politics. While Tess' career is not endorsed as inherently fulfilling, typical gender roles aren't offered as the solution (however much Tess would like to believe they are). Indeed, the film asks for compromise and balance from its characters - in fact, no clear solution is reached by the film's end. It's up to the viewer to hope that they'll find one.One of the film's delights is that's precisely what you do wish. It's easy to see from their debut why Hepburn and Tracy went on to become one of cinema's most indelible teams, making eight more films together. Their deep mutual affection for one another (on and off the set) lights up the screen. It's a terrific, palpable energy.The screenplay won the Oscar for 1942, and it's a wonderful complement to the cast.

Perhaps, due to hearing so much about the sparks that flew during this now near-mythic first teaming for so long, I was afraid the actual movie couldn't live up to the hype. How wrong I was.\"Woman Of The Year\" is a fantastic movie! The attraction between Hepburn and Tracy is very evident. So much so that, at several points, you feel that they are are honestly and sincerely saying the words to each other, not just characters reciting lines.Neither Hepburn nor Tracy was considered conventionally attractive in their time, but here, both are at their most witty, charming, and yes, sexy! Hepburn is even downright girlish when flirting with Tracy, who exudes a quiet but very strong masculine presence. Even though he is considered one of the greatest dramatic actors, Tracy shows quite an instinct for comedy. Just as with his dramatic roles, he is so natural and effortless, he hardly seems to be acting at all!The heat generated in the scene where the two are alone in Hepburn's apartment could rival just about anything Hollywood calls \"sexy\" today.Watching this movie is like simply observing conversations between two people, thanks to George Stevens' superb direction. Notice how throughout much of movie, there isn't even backgroung music! The strength of the dialogue between Hepburn and Tracy carries everything, which is to take nothing away from the supporting players, who are equally strong.Hepburn is brillant in the final scenes, trying to act as if she knows her way around a kitchen, all the while, the breakfast she's making is falling apart, while Tracy just sits and watches her cluelessness.

When it comes to the Spenser Tracy/Katherine Hepburn pairing, the word \"chemistry\" is used quite often.  The thing about it is, though, that this stuff goes way beyond chemistry.  This is real, honest-to-life drama.Spenser Tracy's character is utterly relatable.  He reacts and he does what it seems any guy of the era, or even today, would do in such a situation.  His character is torn between his absolute adoration of Tess, and the knowledge that not only will he never amount to what Tess is, he also is pretty much emasculated by her self-actualization.And for Katherine Hepburn, who plays Tess, there couldn't have been a better role.  Hepburn, who was naturally independent anyway, plays the role of a knowledgeable Woman's Woman without needing an extra breath.The thing about the films with these two are that they actually present a relationship, not just a courtship and a \"and then they lived happily ever after, for all time\" ending.  They show the real issues with communication, work, space, and borders, everything that must be understood about a person to make it work.  And they are absolutely adoring of each other.Just like in the later film, Adam's Rib (1949), this film presents the issues and friction in their relationship almost spectacularly well from both sides.  I can't say that this film was as good as Adam's Rib (George Steven's directing is just a tad off-balanced and the pacing is a little uneven), but at any rate it's a real joy to watch, from the beginning courting to the slapstick ending.--PolarisDiB"],["This is the first of the nine movies Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn made together. The on-screen romance was carried over into their private lives that lasted 25 years. New York Times in its obituary column wrote \"Her life and career were dominated by her love affair with Spencer Tracy, which created one of the great romantic legends and brilliant movie pairings of their day.\" Katharine Hepburn's independent life and strong-willed movie characters made her a role model for generations of young women for more than 60 years. Hepburn and Tracy became one of Hollywood's most recognizable couples. Hepburn had an agile mind and distinctive New England accent, which was complemented by Tracy's machismoWoman of the year is a light hearted romantic comedy, which examines the lives of professional couples and how it affects their private lives. As you can guess there is certain amount of drama in the midst of a love story. The beautiful, brilliant and independent journalist Tess Harding (Katharine Hepburn) and the macho sportswriter Sam Craig (Spencer Tracy) clash over whether athletic events should be suspended for the duration of the war.  She insists that sports column be abolished during war, but Sam believes that it is essential for morale. The editor brings them together to make peace but the pair when they see each other for the first time, they fall in love! When they start dating, things don't go easy on them. When Sam takes her to a ball game, Tess like the game, but when Tess introduces Sam to her international friends, he is not too thrilled. Nonetheless, they marry, but he quickly discovers she is so busy with her profession and that she has no time for him. When she adopts a war orphan without discussing with him, he realizes a drastic step must be taken, because she has no idea of being a wife and mother.There are some very funny scenes in the movie; one of my favorite is when Tess drives back to Sam's apartment while he is sleeping; she decides to prove herself as a wife and a good cook. Using a recipe book she prepares his breakfast, which awakens Sam, and he silently watches as everything goes wrong for Tess, she breakdown when coffeepot and waffle iron both overflow, and the kitchen get messy. Sam then embraces her and says he doesn't want to change her; he merely wants their marriage to come first. The ending is somewhat discomforting for modern day feminists as it sounds too anti-family to be an independent professional woman. After all, this movie was made for audience of the year 1942, and they wouldn't have a liked it any other way than a woman learns a lesson, finally, that she has to be a caring wife, and not just a professional journalist and a political activist.1.The Hepburn & Tracy Signature Collection (Woman of the Year / Pat and Mike / Adam's Rib / The Spencer Tracy Legacy)2.TCM Greatest Classic Films Collection: Romantic Comedies (Adam's Rib / Woman of the Year / The Philadelphia Story / Bringing Up Baby)3.Katharine Hepburn Collection (Morning Glory / Undercurrent / Sylvia Scarlett / Without Love / Dragon Seed / The Corn Is Green [1979])"],["Aside from Hepburn &amp; Tracy's debut as a team, all credit should be given to director George Stevens for putting together this very complicated story so seamlessly. Mr. Stevens finally won an Oscar in 1951 for &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; and again in 1956 for &quot;Giant&quot;. After &quot;Woman ofthe Year&quot;, Stevens was nominated for &quot;The More the Merrier&quot;, another complicated plot that he handled with brilliance (remade in the 60's as a Cary Grant romp). Tracy &amp; Hepburn are wonderful (Kate getting a nomination), and Kate's pant-suits certainly must've made a fashion statement; Kate was certainly more comfortable in those clothes than the glamour girls of the time, and though not a great beauty, she was glamorous. I still don't understand why Kate became &quot;box-office poison&quot; in the late 30's; I thought she was brilliant in &quot;Stage Door&quot;, &quot;Holiday&quot; and &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot;.

I think it's most entertaining."],["What's surprising about this film is it's age. Despite the enormous social changes that have occurred since this film was made (6 decades?) it's funny how these two characters could still be genuinely portrayed today. This character study of a socially and politically sophisticated woman, very well respected locally and globally for her charm, brains and political savvy ways, and her odd love for a regular guy who almost becomes a novelty to her after their marriage is not far cry from what could be made today. Spencer Tracy, as a newspaper sportswriter, crosses into the world of a social sophisticate played by Katherine Hepburn through an argument over some glib comments she makes about baseball which makes it into her radio address. Despite their differences there is a spark. That spark is nurtured by both of them until it becomes a passion leading to a brief but poignant romance. Once married, however, they are too different from each other. This wouldn't be so bad but Hepburn's character, rather than resolving the issues between them decides to resume her life and it's time consuming pace leaving her understanding but frustrated husband to his own pursuits while he evidently would rather have more of her attention. It comes down to a question of what a person wants. Hepburn's &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; is used to doing things her way and doesn't understand her commitment to making a marriage. This comes to head and the film makes a brave attempt to resolve these differences. Katherine's character is not an ice queen but a motivated person who's used to having her own life. Spencer's character is a sincere guy who's married to woman who has a demanding life who doesn't balance her time between home and career. In the end she realizes that she's not the perfect person and tries to bring her marriage back from the brink of failure. He cautions her that life is not as simple as just walking away from commitments and learning how to cook and expects her to make compromises not sacrifices.While there is some silly kitchen scenes at the end it's really an effort by the director to point out the futility of a person suddenly trying to reinvent herself. Her husband doesn't expect too much even if he's not a great motivational speaker. He also doesn't blame her for her plight but lets her know that she has options she has to consider. Reverse these rolls and it's easy to see how this film works on the two levels. If this were a man there would be no doubt that the woman was making sense. This film is almost revolutionary.

Between the laughs is mixed in a pair of messages:  (1) that success in life can feel somewhat empty if you have no one to share it with, and (2) a domestic home life can prove to be a daunting challenge to even the most accomplished of public figures.Newspaper columnist Tess Harding (Katharine Hepburn) is drawn into a good natured war of words with a co-worker over comments she made during a radio show.  Although entertaining to readers, the printed jabs hurled between her and sportswriter Sam Craig (Spencer Tracy) comes to an abrupt end when their boss makes it clear he wants his newspaper writers to maintain a united front to the public.  During this announcement, the two writers meet for the first time and become smitten with one another.  Although Tess and Sam seemingly have nothing in common, they grow closer and eventually marry.  However, problems begin almost immediately as Tess is unable to comprehend the importance of being married and Sam becomes frustrated with her inability to keep her work life and home life separate.  Tess, however, soon gains some valuable insight into her situation when she attends her father's wedding and soon Tess and Sam are reunited with a much better understanding of their relationship.Watching Hepburn and Tracy work their magic on screen gives \"Woman of the Year\" a special charm.  Yet the film produces some mixed reactions.  Despite the quality of its performances and its addressing of relevant social issues, its messages come across as a little misguided.  The film implies that a successful career and a fulfilling domestic life are incompatible for women.  To make matters worse, the screwball manner in which Tess is portrayed in the last third of the film causes the film to lose more of its luster.  It seems that the intent was to add in more comedy to the final act to help offset the mounting drama, but the comedy comes at the expense of undermining Tess' character.  The positive role model she created for women up to this point is washed away as the bumbling Tess finds it difficult to accomplish such simple tasks as lighting a stove or making toast.  Yet, despite this unfortunate turn of events, \"Woman of the Year\" is still an entertaining film.  The writing is sharp for the most part and the baseball game sequence is a classic.  Tracy's final scene in the film is also great as he finally lets Tess' personal assistant know what he really thinks of him.  Chalk up \"Woman of the Year\" as a film that fell short of its aspirations but is still solid entertainment nonetheless."],["This is the movie that started my life long love affair with Tracy and Hepburn. Wonderful movie and the acting is so true that you forget that it is a movie. Both the stars are at the top of their game in this one and it certainly delivers the laughs. In my humble opinion, the best of the many from these two."],["Woman of the Year is billed as a comedy, but it is not.

I'm not particularly a fan of this genre, so it takes something really special to appeal to me.  If this describes you too, skip \"Silk Stockings\" and go directly to Fred & Ginger's earlier films \"Top Hat\" and \"Swing Time.\"  Although this film with Fred & Cyd Charisse has its moments (Janis Paige gets some laughs, Charisse has a terrific solo dance number where her dour Communist character finally gets into those silk stockings, and this is the only place you'll ever see Peter Lorre sing and dance), ultimately it just drags.  One could never say that about the above-mentioned Fred & Ginger classics.Even the score by the legendary Cole Porter has zero memorable tunes...again, unless this type of film is your cup of tea, in which case it'll appeal to you.  As for me, by the final half-hour I was continually amazed the film wasn't over yet, as another scene and then yet another scene started up while I was hoping for \"The End.\"  And it's actually surprising to me to find that this film is considered a comedy; other than Paige, I got zero laughs out of it.  And Astaire, now middle-aged in 1957, is a shadow of his former self.  Ultimately I just shut it off before the ending because I was falling asleep, so even though the film has its moments I give it only one star.  A sleeping pill deserves no more."],["Silk Stockings is a thoroughly enjoyable musical treat and we don't get many of those today. Fred Astaire is as ever peerless and Cyd Charisse is lovely. The light comedy by Jules Munshin, Peter Lorre (would you believe) and Joseph Buloff is corny but good. The musical score is pleasant the plot is dated but more than adequate (I have not seen Ninotchka). Possibly my highlight is the dance routine to Red Blues it is wonderful, although Janis Paige and Fred doing the \"Glorious Technicolour Breathtaking Cinemascope and Stereophonic Sound\" number is fabulous. No Ginger Rogers sadly but a super addition to any Fred Astaire fans movie collection."],["LOVE it!  Great story.  Tough broad, learns to soften but who wouldn't with Fred Astire around!  Story that holds up to movies today even."],["There are a number of good things about Silk Stockings, but there also is a professional finality about the movie that makes it easier to observe than to be delighted by it. It was one of the last of the big MGM musicals coming from Arthur Freed's production unit. It was the last musical Fred Astaire made as the lead. It was the last film directed by Rouben Mamoulian. It was based on the last Broadway musical Cole Porter wrote. Silk Stockings also was used to make a statement about the excesses some thought were ruining films and music...the advent of rock and roll and the technological changes in films with wide screen and stereo sound. It even takes a crack at the fashion for ballet in many musicals. You've got to be very clever and original to successfully parody things which are already self-parodies. Silk Stockings, even with its many entertaining moments, isn't that clever.The story is based on Ninotchka, the female Soviet commissar who comes to Paris and finds romance reluctantly...and then enthusiastically. Paris is presented as a place where decadence was never more innocent and persuasive. Steve Canfield (Fred Astaire) is a Hollywood producer in Paris who plans to make a film starring a famous film star (Janis Paige), using the music of a famous Soviet composer who isn't thrilled at returning to Moscow. Three Soviet bureaucrats (Peter Lorre, Jules Munshin and Joseph Buloff), bumblers all, have been sent to retrieve him...but they fall prey to the charms of Paris, too. So one of the toughest, most dedicated commissars is sent to bring them all back. She is Nina Yoshenko (Cyd Charisse), and she is as humorless as a training manual. Canfield piles on the charm, Ninotchka finally softens, romance blossoms. And then, of course, a misunderstanding arises. Ninotchka returns to Moscow, but a bit of sly dealing by Steve gets her back to Paris. The misunderstanding is solved, love blossoms anew, and East-West relations, at least for Steve and Ninotchka, warm up considerably. Marriage is just a kiss and a dance away.One of the things that seems so odd is that, for a Fred Astaire film, Astaire spends a good deal of time doing knee drops, full-length on-the-floor sprawls and athletic dance moves that limit the sophisticated and smooth Astaire style. He was 59 when he made the picture, and this might explain the relative shortness of some of the sequences. Still, while he is assured and immensely watchable (and while he can still do wonders with a cane), three major dance productions he is in just seem choppy.Most of the songs from the Broadway show were retained and Porter wrote a couple of new ones. It's become routine with Porter to say that whatever his latest show was, the score was never one of his best. In this case, it's true. The romantic songs are great, but the topical speciality numbers just seem tired.--\"Too Bad\" is a raucous song and dance involving the three Soviet flunkies, Steve and three ladies Steve brought to convince the flunkies they don't need to hurry to go back to Moscow. There's a nice sequence involving Astaire dancing with each of the women. Watching Peter Lorre gamely taking part, however, I didn't find very funny. He had health problems, was over-weight and it showed.--\"Paris Loves Lovers\" is a charming song Astaire sings to Charisse, and then she counterpoints in the reprise.--\"Stereophonic Sound,\" for me, just isn't particularly clever or funny. Janis Paige plays a character who has no subtlety, and she delivers the song the same way. This is the first of the production numbers that have Astaire sliding under desks and dropping onto the floor.--\"It's a Chemical Reaction, That's All.\" This clever little throw away is used by Ninotchka to explain to Steve that love is nothing more than predictable chemistry.When the electro-magnetic of the hemaleMeets the electro-magnetic of the female,If right away she should say, 'This is the male,'It's a chemical reaction, that's all.And though you fascists may answer with kissesThe same applies when you're mister and missus.Hey diddle diddle with middle class kisses.It's a chemical reaction that's all.--Which leads immediately to one of Porter's first-class songs, \"All of You,\" which includes the naughty line that sends schoolboys to sniggering every time they hear it. The song is sung by Astaire to a skeptical Charisse.I love the looks of you, the lure of you.I'd love to make a tour of you,The arms, the eyes, the mouth of you,The east, west, north, and the south of you.I'd love to gain complete control of youAnd handle even the heart and soul of you.So love at least a small percent of me, do.'Cause I love all of you.--\"Satin and Silk,\" a speciality number for Paige.--\"Silk Stockings.\" This is one of Porter's great brooding, throbbing latin melodies, danced by Cyd Charisse.--\"Without Love\" is such a paean to the wholesome hetero love of a woman for a man that Porter must have had a great time writing the lyrics.--\"Fated to Mated\" is a jaunty song sung by Astaire to Charisse which leads into an extended dance routine for them. The dance is the second number that winds up more athletic than we're used to.--\"Josephine,\" another speciality number for Paige, much abbreviated from the Broadway version.--\"Siberia,\" a not-too-funny specialty number for Lorre, Munshin and Buloff.--\"The Red Blues.\" This is probably the second least inspired number by Porter. It's redeemed by a driving arrangement, vivid choreography and a knock-out performance by Charisse. She was a skilled, precise dancer who could handle any steps they gave her. She does a great job here.--\"The Ritz Roll and Rock.\" Astaire is said to have asked Porter to come up with a big finale number that would poke fun at all the changes in the musical scene that had been happening in the Fifties. This was the result and, to my view, it simply isn't very good. The song lacks cleverness and wit. Astaire was always expert, but this has him starting out in a classic white tie and tails pose, then sends him spinning on the floor and finishing by smashing his top hat with his fist. As Cyd Charisse said years later in one of the extras on the DVD, \"Though Fred was wonderful, it was clear that the age he had come to emulate was over.\" This number just doesn't do the job.Astaire, as always, is first class. Charisse is easy to look at and a fine dancer. George Tobias, as a commissar in Moscow and Ninotchka's boss, gives a sly and dead-pan performance. Some of Porter's songs are very good. Mamoulian brought the film in on time and under budget. And Silk Stockings was a success with ticket buyers.The DVD transfer is excellent. There are several light-weight extras, the best of which is a 1934 musical short based on Porter's Fifty Million Frenchman. It stars Bob Hope and a singer-dancer named Dorothy Stone. It only runs 21 minutes but it features four fine Porter songs from the show, including Hope singing \"You Do Something to Me.\" At any excuse for a cue, a group of chorus girls and boys prance in to dance with that endearingly clunky style of early musicals."],["For years we had heard of 'Silk Stockings', but had never watched it. We loved watching Gred Astaire and Cyd Chareese dancing - they are our favorites. And a fun storyline - never seen Peter Lorre in a comic role before, and he was great, as were all the other actors. Do yourself a favor and watch this very fun musical."],["Takes Ninotchka to a higher level.  With Cyd Charisse doing the Greta Garbo role this is a terrific movie.  Astaire does his usual great dancing and his acting is yeoman as well.  The story was certainly germane to the time it was filmed with the Cold Was still raging.  It was a kick to see Peter Lorre both fat and funny...different role for him."],["This 1957 MGM movie produced by Arthur Freed was the film version of the 1955 Broadway musical, itself a musical reworking of the 1939 MGM comedy film Ninotchka, starring Greta Garbo in the title role. Here our heroine is played by Cyd Charisse, with Fred Astaire as her dance partner. Nina is sent from Moscow to check up on three Russian emissaries, delightfully played by Peter Lorre, Jules Munshin and Joseph Buloff, who fall into wicked capitalist ways, to which Nina also eventually succumbs, with Janis Paige in a supporting role. The Russian commissar is played effectively by George Tobias in the film, in the earlier stage version and in the 1939 film. Didn't I mention already? The music is by Cole Porter. While most of the tunes were not `standards', they were entirely appropriate vehicles for the spectacular dance numbers and the script has all the comedy of the original film. If you like musicals, this is irresistible!"],["With the passing of Cyd Charisse last week at age 86, it's worth seeking out what is probably her finest work on celluloid. Granted as an actress, she was bland, and as a singer, she was dubbed (this time by the sonorous-sounding Carol Richards). But as a dancer, she was extraordinary. Along with Vera-Ellen, the ballet-trained Charisse was in the top echelon of the female dancers that MGM showcased during the studio's golden years of which this film is one of its final stops. The clearest evidence of this claim can be found in the title tune when she dances with beauty and precision elegantly changing from her drab street clothes into silk and satin. It's a remarkable number, no small feat since her co-star is Fred Astaire. Directed by early musical maven Rouben Mamoulian (Love Me Tonight) in what turned out to be his last film, the movie also marks Astaire's swan song as a musical comedy leading man. Symbolically, he smashes his top hat at the end of his final solo number, \"The Ritz Roll and Rock\". The wear barely shows in his dancing where he pulls off some of his most acrobatic numbers, but other than the professionalism of the two leads, the inspiration seems sadly missing.The film is a partial remake of Ernst Lubitsch's 1939 classic comedy,Ninotchka- in fact, some scenes are repeated verbatim - although certain elements have been altered to accommodate Cole Porter's musical score. This musical translation first showed up on Broadway two years earlier, but further revisions have obviously been made to tailor the story to the dancing talents of the leads. Charisse has the unenviable task of stepping into Greta Garbo's shoes as top Soviet envoy Ninotchka Yoschenko, who is sent to Paris to retrieve three lesser envoys swept up by the City of Lights. They had already botched their mission to lure famous Russian composer Peter Boroff back to the mother country. At the same time, American movie producer Steve Canfield wants Boroff to score his next picture, a musical bowdlerization of Tolstoy'sWar and Peacestarring comically curvaceous Peggy Dayton, a parody of an Esther Williams-style swimming star whose been in the pool too long. As Dayton uses her feminine wiles to entice Boroff, Canfield tries to seduce Ninotchka, a far frostier proposition though the eventual thawing is inevitable. Porter's music tends to have that effect or so we're led to believe.Playing another variation on the worldly photographer he played in the same year'sFunny Face, Astaire is still at the top of his game, but his dance numbers are less elegant and appear markedly shorter than usual here. Charisse cannot compare to the legendary Garbo when it comes to line readings as a stoic communist. However, her dancing truly transcends - not only the title tune but also \"The Red Blues\", an impressive ensemble number showcasing Charisse in a variety of dance styles, and the two duets with Astaire to \"All of You\" - the first a romantic defrosting of Ninotchka and the second a jauntier, rhythmic pas-de-deux. I wish the rest of the film was as good, but sadly, the energy wavers and the pacing flags during its 117-minute running time. The rest of the cast is serviceable, in particular, Janis Paige on familiar ground as Peggy (nicely paired with Astaire on the energetically cynical \"Stereophonic Sound\") and George Tobias as the deadpan Soviet commissar. Peter Lorre (M) and Jules Munshin (Ozzie inOn the Town) show up as two of the bumbling envoys. The 2003 DVD has some interesting extras beginning with a ten-minute short featuring a 2003 interview with the still-elegant Charisse in \"Cole Porter in Hollywood: Satin and Silk\". Because of the Porter tie-in, there is also a 1934 Bob Hope short, \"Paree, Paree\", a silly musical comedy with Hope wooing singer Dorothy Stone. Also included is the original theatrical trailer, as well as \"Poet and Peasant Overture\" with Alfred Wallenstein conducting the MGM symphony orchestra playing the Franz Von Suppe piece as an overture to the movie."],["I liked it better than \"The Band Wagon,\" because the Fred Astaire character has more to offer the Cyd Charisse character than in \"Silk Stockings.\"So the audience has more reason to root for the couple to wind up together."],["Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse create movie magic in Rouben Mamoulian's beautiful and snazzy screen version of Cole Porter's broadway hit.The transfer to DVD is simply stunning (especially considering it was filmed after the demise of Technicolor) with a bold, fresh host of hues, and sharpness and detail beautifully handled in the conversion from film to tape. The 5.1 surround track truly kicks it, too!Highly recommended."],["Fred Astaire has always been a performer who's work is very close to my heart. The last real Fred Astaire movie (excluding his geriatric non-singing, non-dancing or non-starring roles) is 1957's \"Silk Stockings\".I was a little afraid to watch Silk Stockings at first. Sure, it had a Cole Porter score supervised by Andre Previn, and Hermes Pan choreography, and, sure, Fred made fabulous movies even at that age (\"the Bandwagon\", \"Daddy Long Legs\"), but I knew it was Fred's last, and I didn't want to know why. Now I know what a pleasure I was depriving myself of.\"Silk Stockings\" is a musical remake of \"Ninotchka\",  a 1939 Greta Garbo picture. It's about a serious stern young  russian woman, sent as an envoy to nab a russian composer living illegally in Paris. The composer is betraying his russian classical heritage by writing music for a low brow movie musical. The director of this movie, played by Fred Astaire, distracts the pretty young russian (Cyd Charisse) with the wonders of Paris, classy night clubs, and dancing to jazz. In falling for him, her strict heartless personality melts away.This movie was produced at the height of the cold war, and the height of Hollywood blacklisting, and it's commie-bashing could make some uncomfortable. To me, those jokes are anything but propaganda. The cultural stereotypes are played for laughs, and should be taken with a grain of salt. Of course, I'm a big fan of the top hat and tails ritzy romantic culture that Astaire's character teaches Charisse's character the joys of, so it's easy for me to say.With the exception of the classics \"All of You\" and \"Paris is For Lovers\", Cole Porter's songs are comic, here. But, that being said, they are hilarious. This was towards the end of Porter's career too. Infact, this was towards the end of the movie musical as America knew it.Rock and Roll was taking over. To me, the most moving moments in this movie are not the dramatic love scenes shared by Astaire and Charisse, they are the self referential moments, where Porter, Astaire, and choreographer Hermes Pan acknowledge that their era in over.Porter wrote special material just for this movie. One highlight is a tune called \"Stereophonic Sound\". In it, the singer quips about how moviegoers used to be content to see talented performers do their thing, and a nice love story, but these days all they want is \"glorious Technicolor, breathtaking CinemaScope, and Stereophonic sound!\" The song puts down all the gimmickry of the modern Hollywood, and even has one verse quite obviously about Fred Astaire himself. Porter writes that these days a great hoofer in tails is not enough, they want a ballet (alluding to Gene Kelly's ballet dance number fad).Fred Astaire's last MGM dance number is to the song \"Ritz Rollin' Rock\". It's Porter's parody of this new music called Rock and Roll, ironically borrowing from Irving Berlin's dated \"Puttin' On the Ritz\". This sequence, choreographed by Astaire's long-time collaborator Hermes Pan, ends with Fred writhing on the floor, wearing his 1930's tails and top hat. As the horns hit the last big chord, Fred removes his trade-marked top hat and smashes it flat with his fist.The message Porter, Astaire and Pan slipped into this novelty number, is very powerful, if you know what you're seeing.Pop entertainment changed in the sixties, and the the old kings abdicated their thrones to... well... the King, I suppose.Anyway, if you're a Fred-head like me, and you're afraid to see Fred's final fling, \"Silk Stockings\", don't be. You'll be reminded why he and his period of Hollywood was great."],["Beautiful Cyd Charisse is Ninotchka, romantically convincing when she dances, her Russian character rounded out with the grace of the ballerina. The three kommissars and Borov the composer provide appropriate satire on the old Soviet values, and Fred Astaire and Janis Paige represent the crassness of USA as only Hollywood can serve as a presentation of the rewards of the American Dream. Fred Astaire plays Fred Astaire as usual, ( I am more of a fan of Gene Kelly), but Janis Paige, marvellous as she is, has to play a character which has similarities with the actress who needed elocution lessons in \"Singing in the Rain\". There were a few moments when I detected, in her eyes, a hint of Melina Mercouri's style, and this makes me feel that she could have brought more depth to her part.Her songs, satirical \"Stereofonic Sound\" and lingerical \"Satins and Silks\" are perfect for her character, but they did not impact on me as I had remembered from years ago.Overall the music, dances and songs are perfect for the story and I have watched this film twice since it arrived.It is a marvellous representation of what Hollywood produced musically all those years ago.It will definitely watched again."],["I love all the Fred Astaire movies and this one is second only to Funny Face with Audrey Hepburn.  This movie pairs Mr. Astaire with the lovely and elegant Cyd Charisse.  She was a wonderful actress and brilliant dancer.

Three Russian envoys are sent to convince the composer to return to France, but they get caught up in the beauty and life of Paris. Another envoy, a woman, Ninotchka Yoschenko, played by Cyd Charisse, is sent to bring the four Russians home. Her serious demeanor is met by equal attempts to woo her by Steve Canfield. Eventually the woman is won over by the city and the man. All goes wrong, however, when Canfield turns the composer's classic music into popular music for the production. Insulted, all the Russian nationals return home. Once home, all letters from Canfield to Yoschenko are censored by the Russian goverment. Eventually, the original three envoys are sent back to Paris and Yoschenko must return to retrieve them again. Once in Paris, she realizes that Canfield wants to marry her, therefore keeping her from returning to Russia. It's a beautiful happy ending with LOTS of musical numbers, comedy, and romance. It's a perfect girls night in movie."],["This is the last musical Fred Astaire made and he did go out on a high note with this musical remake of Ninotchka.  Fred Astaire is up to his usually high standard. His numbers with Cyd Charisse are sheer perfection.  I agree with one of the early reivewers of this film who called for congress to mandate Astaire and Charisse to make a film every two years. Along with Astaire and Charisse, there is also Janis Page who steals every scene that is not nailed down (and sometimes even then).While the plot of the movie is meant to follow that of the old Melvin Douglas Greta Garbo movie, this movie is a departure in many ways. First of all instead of a cache of jewels, the two protagonists argue over a Soviet composer, is he Russian or is he French.  This sets things in motion. Since the jewels are out, so is the Countess Swana, instead there Janis Page who plays a kind of Esther Williams swimming musical star, Peggy Dayton who is trying to grow professionally by playing Empress Josephine in a crazy film version of \"War and Peace\" which apparently is not about \"War and Peace.\"  She is not so much a rival for Cyd Charisse, but a frequent and wonderful distraction.  Her numbers like \"Silk and Satin\" and \"Stereophnic Sound\" are wonderful.  The funniest number is \"Ritz Roll and Rock\" in which Fred Astaire attempts to get down in a kind of pastiche of teen rock and roll musical numbers popular at the time.This is an excellent movie, loads of fun, with stand out performances by all concerned."],["Good acting, but what's great about the movie is the dancing.

The timelessness comes from Fred and Cyd Charisse in a great musical romantic comedy. The dated aspects are most of the digs at the Cold War Russians, but it's all part of the fun.In this retelling of &quot;Ninotchka&quot;, lots of comedy mileage is gotten from the Cold War and the sad state of the Russian citizenry (&quot;You mean you want to get IN to Russia? Of your own free will?!&quot;). Three whole numbers are dedicated to the misery of being a Russian under Communist rule (&quot;Siberia&quot;, &quot;Too Bad, We Can't Go Back to Moscow&quot;, and &quot;The Red Blues&quot;). Some other tunes like &quot;It's a Chemical Reaction, That's All&quot; pit the Commie view of love against the good ol' red white and blue all-American view.Two numbers, &quot;All of You&quot; and &quot;Silk Stockings&quot;, are both well worth the price of admission. There has never been a finer example of the pure grace in the art of dance than when Cyd and Fred perform in &quot;All of You&quot;. In the &quot;Silk Stockings&quot; number, Cyd solos in a balletic dance showing how the Russian robot becomes seduced by the luxury and femininity of Paris.The Cole Porter songs are okay, but hardly his apex. &quot;Ritz Roll and Rock&quot; is an interesting curio if nothing else, as Porter and Astaire try their hand at rock n' roll. Even though the song is so-so, the dance number is pretty good, and when the curtain rises on Fred in this one, you know he and he alone owns the dance floor... before the dance even starts!&quot;The Poet and Peasant Overture&quot; is included as a short subject, apparently to show off the new miracle of the CinemaScope widescreen process. As an odd, but added treat, an early Bob Hope short &quot;Paree, Paree&quot;, rounds things out. Bob gets second billing to the (now) forgotten actress Dorothy Stone in this 1934 musical tidbit. There's even a strange, Busby Berkeley look to the impromptu dance numbers, with a score of leggy dancers forming ever-evolving star and pinwheel patterns.A good disc by far for Fred fans, and a keeper, regardless."],["Classic Astaire & Charisse. Together they're magic! Unexpectedly, Peter Lorre shows a touch of comedy here."],["Besides featuring the talented Cyd Charrise and Fred Astaire, this film has a great dance routine featuring three girls as another reviewer quoted, \"definitely know how to dance.\" These gals must have rehearsed with Fred for weeks just for this 3-minute routine but it adds significant value to the movie.Dancers are Tybee Afra as Fifi (dark hair in red dress), Barrie Chase as Gabrielle (brunette in gold dress and long gloves), Betty Uitti as Suzette (the blonde in the dropped-waist beautiful dress).Tybee is from Cuba and this Latina definitely has the cha-cha moves. Sadly she passed away in 1982. Barrie went on to be Fred Astaire's TV program partner. No other info on Betty.What also makes this dance very spectacular are the beautiful dresses wore by Tybee, Barrie, and Betty. Such fashions are no longer seen in Hollywood these days which illustrate how much women's fashions have gone downhill since then. Compared to this, dance routines on VH1 these days are boring.Would be great to see a presentation/tribute featuring Tybee, Barrie, and Betty at a PDS Gypsy Awards."],["Not the sassy, saucy and brilliant Cyd Charisse I've grown to adore.  Fred Astaire is fine here, but I'm not a big fan of his. If you haven't seen Charisse, I'd recommend the comedic \"It's Always Fair Weather\" or the romantic \"Brigadoon\" - both with Gene Kelly - as vastly better displays of her acting talents. Also, check out \"The Band Wagon\" with Fred Astaire for perhaps her best on screen  dance performance.  The plot is reminiscent of some 50s and 60s TV sitcoms - playing on buffoons in military garb. \"Sergeant Bilko\" and \"McHale's Navy\" come to mind. Politically correct (Soviet style), a team of  military and intelligence officers travel on a mission to Paris, where they are promptly seduced by the hedonistic culture, replete with babes, booze and, of course, silk stockings.  The plot is entirely predictable and IMHO does not display the considerable magnetism and acting qualities Charisse possessed.  There are  some decent dance scenes.  Picture and audio were fine.  As a classic from the 50s, maybe worth a view.

Astaire plays, Steven Canfield, a rotten capitalist and movie producer who butts heads with communist, special envoy, Nina Yoshenko, who has been sent from Moscow to Paris to apprehend a wayward Russian composer.  The cast also includes Janis Paige in a hilarious and campy lampoon of an 'Esther Williams-type' actress attempting to play Napoleon's Josephine in a musical remake of &quot;War and Peace&quot;.  Peter Lorre and Jules Munshin are at their comedy best as two communist sympathizers wooed by the pleasures of Paris.AT LAST - a transfer worthy of the elegant Mr. Cole Porter.  Warner Home Video gives us a rich looking, robust sounding DVD that really celebrates the performances in this memorable musical.  Colors are deep, rich, gorgeous and consistant throughout.  Contrast and shadow levels are outstanding.  Fine details are amazingly sharp.  Edge enhancement, shimmering and aliasing are practically non-existant.  There is no pixelization or film or digital grain to speak of, for a thoroughly smooth but sharp visual presentation that will surely please.  The audio has been remixed to 5.1 and is marvelous, rich sounding and fully realized within the confines of its dated characteristic.Extras: Another Cole Porter/making-of featurette that is really a throw away, save the few glimpses of Cyd Charisse and Janis Paige that we get.  Theatrical trailer and cast bios and a couple of short subjects - not anamorphically enhanced, even though the film (thank heaven) is!Bottom Line: This disc is a must have and the only DVD of the Cole Porter bunch worthy of your hard earned money.  BUY IT TODAY!"],["MGM's production of &#34;Silk Stockings&#34; was vastly superior to the second rate Cole Porter Broadway musical on which it was based, to a great extent because the leading lady, Hildegarde Neff, could neither sing nor dance. Of course, Charisse is dubbed, as she always was, though her very infrequent stage appearances proved that the voice was on key, but too faint unless she was miked heavily. But the lady could sure dance. 'Dancing in the Dark' in :&#34;The Bandwagon&#34; also with Astaire, and the best musical ever made, is the most romantic moment on film, bar none. But the title song, as danced here by Charisse is as beautiful a number  as she has ever filmed.  (I have to block out 'One Alone' from &#34;Deep in My Heart&#34; as James Mitchell, finally given a chance to dance in an MGM musical, actually steals the number from her no matter how good she is.) Janis Paige is a hoot as a 'dumb' Esther Williams - Williams was not dumb. But Paige is great. And who would have thought that Peter Lorre would make such a good comedian?Astaire and Charisse are perfection together - they always were. But Astaire's final solo should have been dumped before filming. It is the only clunker in the movie's score - the worst of the Broadway show was long gone. He does what he can with it, but it is a losing cause as the song, 'The Ritz Rock and Roll' was dated when it was filmed and has become a pathetic piece of film now.Otherwise, they are magic- but not 'Dancing in the Dark' magic, which surpassed anything Astaire performed with any of his other leading ladies. Yes, including Ginger.For fun, watch Charisse's skirt become a skort, and then a skirt and then.....with really no reason except that the censor board must have hovered over the set making sure that neither the title song nor Paige's 'Silk and Satin' went beyond their limited line.  They both did. Never underestimate Arthur Freed when he was determined to get around them.So if this is not in your collection, add it.

SILK STOCKINGS is a remarkablly good film for it's genre.  Nothing could beat CYD and FRED dancing, even if the plot isn't strong.  Too bad there wasn't more of JANIS PAGE as one of her numbers seems to have been given the short shift.  Otherwise, the film is a standout and a must for musical lovers.  Any left?  I think so.  Give this one a try as well as the other Cole Porter releases.  Thanks for these, but we want more!!!"],["As much as I love Fred Astair and Cyd Charisse, it must be said that the original Ninotchka has qualities that this version lacks.  But then you don't get Peter Lorre singing and dancing in the original Garbo picture.  For a musical lover, or a Fred Astaire fan it is an absolute must.  Note that you will see much more of Charisse than Astaire, but we'll take what we can get, right?  The quality of the print is very high- overall a great addition to your classic film collection."],["This is possibly one of the last musicals in the old M-G-M studio tradition and one of their first in CinemaScope. Fred is no longer a kid, but his grace, class, charm, and style is just as fresh as always. People tend to forget that Fred was also one of the screens top leading men, I think because he didn't fit the standard mold of the time. The lovely, Cyd Charisse, makes for a wonderful dancing partner in this their second go round since \"The Band Wagon\" a few years earlier.The story is a musical version of \"Ninotchka\", a cold war story involving a young Soviet envoy, Miss Charisse as Ninotchka, going to Paris to bring back three bumbling comrades (who have fallen in love with the \"decadent\" city), and a famous Russian composer, who thinks his music is being used in a serious cinematic musical remake of \"War And Peace\". It's really being transformed into a big brassy musical that stars the wonderful Janis Paige as Peggy Dayton.Ninotchka's idea of a good time is inspecting steel mills! Once she meets Astaire, who plays producer, Steve Canfield, sparks begin to fly and we're in for a treat with great songs and musical numbers by the great Cole Porter!There are four standout musical numbers in this film, the romantic \"All Of You\", the sexy and character transforming \"Silk Stockings\" ballet that is beautifully performed by Cyd which also showcases those gorgeous legs, and \"Fated To Be Mated\" with Fred and Cyd dancing to both traditional and jazz choreography. And finally, \"The Red Blues\" in which Miss Charisse dances to music incorporating ballet, jazz, and traditional Russian folk dance. All in all a delightful film!The transfer is fine and the color makes you wish they made more movies like this!"],["This is a classic.  Tha actors are top notch.

Nevertheless: this film is a MUST for all the fans of Wim Sonneveld."],["I purchased this DVD for my Uncle Rod, who was unable to obtain it elsewhere.  He received the \"Silk Stockings\" DVD from Amazon.com earlier than expected and was very pleased with the quality of the DVD. He enjoyed the other DVD \"It's Always Fair Weather\" better, but that does not take away from the quality.  We are very happy with our purchases and will use the service again."],["If they advertised Ninotchka with the immortal ad-line 'Garbo laughs!', they should have plugged this musical remake with the legend 'Lorre Dances!' The human goldfish shares two musical numbers as one of three Russian commissars sent after a runaway Russian composer who, horror of horrors, is considering composing the score for an American picture to be shot in Paris.If his dancing is amusingly underwhelming, most of the rest of the numbers are in the charge of Fred Astaire as the playboy producer of Janis Paige's 'first non-swimming picture' - War and Peace (well, a bit of it). \"How do you feel about Tolstoy?\" ask the gentlemen of the press. \"There's absolutely no truth to the rumours, we're just good friends,\" she replies between smacking the water out of her ears. Ninotchka (Charisse), the humourless Russian commissar they send after their original commissars, takes a more disapproving view. \"This is an American  picture. You're liable to have Napoleon win.\" Even if you haven't seen the original, it's  not hard to guess which two characters fall in love.Nonetheless, the film is surprisingly entertaining for a later MGM musical (Fred Astaire's last at the studio). Cole Porter delivers a strong score (minus the lyrics to the title number, here used as background to Charisse's big dance solo), Janis Paige delivers a more streetwise variation of Jean Hagen's dumb blonde from Singin' in theRain and the script delivers plenty of digs at the movies in general (\"You know what prestige means?\" \"Yeah, pictures that don't make money.\"), CinemaScope in particular and Communism as a matter of course (\"Get me a copy of 'Who's Still Who.'\").Mamoulian doesn't always know how to handle the Scope frame, ruining a potentially priceless early joke where Lorre coaches his comrades to smile by shooting only the back of his head and not making best use  of the frame in Janis Paige and Fred Astaire's number celebrating 'Glorious Technicolor, Breathtaking CinemaScope and Stereophonic Sound', but elsewhere uses it well enough to make this widescreen version a particular treat if you've only seen the fullframe video or TV versions (the Russkies may have sent three commissars after Borov, but you'd only ever see two at one time on those!). The print used could have done with a bit more remastering but it's more than acceptable and there's a good range of extras - a 2003 behind-the-scenes featurette with Charisse, trailer, a weak early Bob Hope short Paree, Paree with Cole Porter score and and Scope short of the MGM Symphony Orchestra playing The Poet and The Peasant Overture."],["Get this DVD however you can.

Of course that was the wild and wooly wartime 1940s when anything could go, or almost anything, as long as the bad guys go theirs. In the tepid red scare Cold War 1950s thought the role of the myriad romantic pillow talk comedies featured, after a few scraps of course, married domestic tranquility in all its suburban splendors. The film under review, Vincent Minelli&#8217;s Designing Woman, puts paid to that premise, except the suburban part, as Ms. Bacall goes through very different paces.Here is the skinny Marilla (played by Ms. Bacall), a fashion designer, meets Mike (played by Gregory Peck), a top notch sports writer in California at some ill-defined party. It must be the California water or something because these two professional from New York City turn into teenage mush and rush off and get married after a couple of days of knowing each other. The problem is when they get back to New York City and their professional lives they find they do not really know each other, really have nothing in common. But fear not love will out. See Mike is one of those crusader reporters who is hot on the trail of corruption in the boxing arena. And the guy who controls that action does not like being under the microscope, not at all. Since he can&#8217;t get to Mike (he is in hiding) then he orders his boys to snatch Marilla. That does it as Mike finds that he loves his Marilla despite their lack of common interest. Ditto Marilla. See it was easy, very easy to resolve. And they lived happily ever after."],["Dore Schary, who was head of MGM at the time this 1957 comedy was made, has his signature style all over it.  He disliked musicals, because straight comedy was much cheaper, but he didn't mind putting Dolores Gray in the film and making her the lead in a Broadway show, which means we do get a hint of her bravura singing style but not much more.  Vincente Minnelli directed but without his usual flair -- he seemed a little hesitant at using Widescreen, but fortunately rallied by the following year with 1958's trimphant GIGI.The plot resembles a lower-energy remake of 1942's WOMAN OF THE YEAR (Spencer Tracy/Katharine Hepburn) but with Gregory Peck as the slightly rumpled screenwriter and Lauren Bacall, not a columnist but a very busy fashion designer.  They meet cute in California, marry quickly, head back to New York and get along great until the script separates them (a hint of IT'S ALWAYS FAIR WEATHER creeps in, but alas this movie despite much provocation never becomes a musical).  When Bacall and Peck are together they are fine, but overall there isn't a great deal of humor in the humor.  I could almost have given this slight disappointment three stars, but gave an upgrade for the insanely fashionable fashion designer's apartment, and the fact that the two principals, when together, look great.  Along with Dolores Gray, Peck and Bacall, take a look out for the supporting help which includes Sam Levene, Chuck Connors, Ed Platt and Jack Cole, the choreographer.  An amusing and occasionally charming movie but no classic.Woman of the YearIt's Always Fair Weather"],["To say that I'm not entirely familiar with Lauren Bacall is slightly embarrassing for me.  I've seen her in a few films but mostly know of her legendary status and gossip worthy reputation.  Still, her name makes me take notice and I long to see more and more of her films.  `Designing Women' was one of those films I snatched up since I was watching a lot of films from 1957 and it did manage some Oscar attention, so I decided to dive in.  Alongside Gregory Peck (in a delightfully loose performance), Bacall carries this film on her shoulders (which she needs to) and delivers a great performance in a film that is obviously beneath her.My issue with the film is that it is rather simplistic in its approach and thus comes off very amateurish.  The script is kind of awful to be honest, and I'm floored that it received an Oscar nomination.  The battle of the sexes here is played out in a really childish manner and none of the antics surrounding the misunderstanding between husband and wife is just nonsensical and takes away from the film.  The chemistry is great between the leads, and like I said, this is a surprisingly light turn from Peck, who can tend to feel stuffy and too serious in his roles.  Minnelli directs the film with finesse, it's just sad that the film's content doesn't live up to his reputation.  It's pretty to look at, full of great costumes and set pieces (and that choreographed fight sequence, no matter how silly, is certainly fun) but overall this is a so-so film wrapped in an expensive package."],["I really loved this movie. It is stylish, classy and funny all in one. The costumes are wonderful and the plot is funny. I am happy to have this movie in my library."],["I love Gregory Peck. I love him as the serious, morally righteous attorney, the dashing naval captain, you name it. So, really, I should have known that he could pull off a comedic role as well. No one, I don't think, could have known how well he'd pull it off.From his first hilarious hangover to the last &quot;cross-eyed&quot; fight scene, Peck is enchanting. He's completely believable in his role as a sports writer caught up in a new world of dresses and strange choreographers intruding on his poker night. And perhaps it's because he's not known as a comedic actor that he's all the more funny.Designing Woman seems to be a little known film, but I'm certainly glad I found it because it kept me laughing, which brought others into the room to watch it with me. Now I just wish that Peck had made more movies like this."],["Good chick flick. I always enjoy Gregory Peck even when it is a bit light hearted. He and Becall play off each other well."],["The great director Vincent Minnelli (Gigi, American in Paris &amp; Meet Me in St. Louis) does an outstanding job presenting us with the 50's comedy &quot;Designing Woman&quot;.

Her leading man Gregory Peck also in a rare comedic role pulls it off masterfully under the direction of Minnelli.This Warner Brothers DVD is very nicely done.

The original Odd Couple now realize they both had separate lives and different committments.

I hope eventually all of Vincente Minelli's films come outon Blu-ray. They deserve to be seen in every bit of their gorgeousdetail. Even this film's flaws make it richer. Gregory Peck's acting assportswriter Mike Hagen is stiff and lackadaisical and LaurenBacall also seems somehow preoccupied (possibly with her husbandHumphrey Bogart's poor health). But their personal malaise as actorsreinforces one of the central themes of the film, that is, the nearimpossibility of creating a truly compatible marriage. The sexuallyambiguous character of Randy Owens (Jack Cole) also undermines (in agood way) the gender stereotyping that Mike Hagen and his buddiesdesperately cling to. Dancer Lori Shannon and producer Zachary Wilderare the only true adults in the film; it's their eventual pairing atthe end of the film that gives it a sense of emotional completion.Designing Woman also presents a wonderful cinematic vision of New York;it evokes a time when the world of musical theater and Broadway playeda central role in American popular culture."],["In this film, Lauren Bacall hilariously portrays the quintessential high-society, high-fashion New Yorker.  While on a trip to Beverly Hills, she meets and spontaneously marries the wonderful Gregory Peck - an unassuming sports writer who has no idea exactly what he's married into.  Upon their return to New York, Peck's character discovers he's married the darling of New York society as his wife is a renowned designer (think Edith Head or Helen Rose).  What ensues is hilarious encounters between her society coterie and his down-home group of blue-collar writers, setting up perfectly for the witty repartee between Bacall and Peck that defines the movie.  The film culminates in a fashion show-boxing rumble, once again intersecting the seemingly divergent lives of Bacall and Peck.\"Designing Woman\" is a wonderful movie that gives ample opportunity for the magnificent Gregory Peck to show off his comedic skills, however subtly.  I saw this film after \"Roman Holiday\" and it cemented my image of Peck as a dashing and charming leading man who brings out the comedic best in his leading ladies.  The chemistry between Bacall and Peck is evident throughout the movie and is a testament to the adage \"Opposites do attract.\"This is a complete, well-told story with a solid set of supporting characters.

They are an odd couple, since Peck is a sports writer who loves boxing, poker games and horseracing; and Bacall is a fashion designer totally devoted to her profession, and they have nothing in common. This screwball slapstick was directed by Vincent Minnelli for MGM; the director is a master of musicals. His career includes making successful movies such as, \"Meet me in St Louis,\" \"An American in Paris,' and \"Gigi.\" This movie cleverly sneaks musical sequences into the story with Marilla as a designer of a Broadway show. Helen Rose, MGM's fashion designer, suggested this idea for the movie that was supposed to include Grace Kelly and James Stewart. Grace Kelly had to leave show business when she got married to the prince of Monaco, and Stewart declined the offer of the role of Mike Hagan.The Movie starts with the Mike and Marilla meeting at Beverly Hills Hotel in Beverly Hills, CA; they fall in love and get married and return to New York City where they live and work. She lives in a fashionable apartment with friends in high places and he lives in a simple apartment with working friends playing poker. The story has two interesting parts; Marilla struggles to find who Mike's sweetheart was, before her marriage; and Mike risks his life trying to do an investigative story for his newspaper about a mafia boss who rigs boxing matches. Lauren Bacall offers a brilliant comedic performance and Gregory Peck plays the role of a husband who would go to an extraordinary length to lie about his relationship with his previous girlfriend so that his wife Marilla never gets hurt. Dolores Gray, playing as the ex girlfriend of Mike is wonderful and gracious to Marilla when she confides to her that Mike was the kind of man she was looking for.The best dialogue appears to that of the odd couple; here are some of the witty conversations:Marilla Hagen: \"We never argue anymore. And when we do, it never lasts more than a week or two.\"Mike Hagen: \"Why is it that you can't stand the sight of blood on anyone but me?\"Mike Hagen: \"Liquor, I've found, makes me very smart sometimes.\"Mike Hagen: \"So, what's for dinner?\"Marilla Hagen: \"Lori Shannon.\"Mike Hagen: \"For dinner?\"Mike Hagen: \"I'm going into the men's room now to change into the bus boy's green pants.\"Marilla Hagen: [Seeing the mess in Mike's lap] \"What's that?\"Mike Hagen: \"Ravioli.\"Marilla Hagen: \"Didn't you care for it?\"Mike Hagen: \"Oh, no.
