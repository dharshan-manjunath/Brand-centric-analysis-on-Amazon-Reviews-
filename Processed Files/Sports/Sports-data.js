It can hold 3 cans upright or 2 bottles on their side with ice.  You can put 3 bottles in upright with ice but you have to leave the zipper top open which is okay if it doesn't take you over 2 hours to drink them.  They'll still be cold.  I haven't had any problems with cooler's liner yet.  It seems to be holding up nicely.  The mesh pockets are nice to keep your cell phone, a book, cigarettes and lighter(if you're a smoker), or whatever else you really want to keep close.

After our first trip this weekend where we had rain and temps in the 40s, this tent was perfect!  Plenty of room for two queen air mattresses and our bags.  The screened porch is wonderful for storing our cooler, plastic containers of food, and leaving our dirty shoes outside the sleeping area but keeping them away from bugs and weather."],["We just returned from our first weekend camping with this tent - through a few rain showers, the interior stayed perfectly dry! The tent was supremely easy to set up, and we're very happy with our purchase.As with any tent capacity, take &#34;8 people&#34; with a grain of salt - I wouldn't want more than two adults & two kids in there.To note, the screened &#34;porch&#34; area did get water on the floor, but that's because there are ventilation holes at the corners. Not an issue, but wanted to note that in case you think the screened-in area will stay perfectly dry."],["I wanted a bigger tent for me and my two sons while camping. This tent is big. There was room in it for the cots, the gear and we still had open floor space. The screened porch is what was appealing to me. The porch is a decent size. We kept our fishing rods, cooler and shoes on the porch. This made a huge difference in keeping the inside of the tent clean.There is plenty of room sit on a chair inside the screened area, and with the roof, we kept out of the sun in the afternoon. It was a pain to have to zip and unzip two times for every entry or exit, but the double barrier made it noticeably tougher for the bugs to find their way into the sleeping area.The tent had a couple of pockets on the inside walls and a loop for a light in the middle of the roof. Nothing overly special. I was disappointed that there was no electrical/cooler access port. We encountered a mild rain with some wind. We stayed completely dry and the tent had no problems in the wind.Set up took two of us. Not that difficult, but I do not think one person would have an easy time with the long tent poles."],["Definitely keeps the bugs out and very solid construction.  I was able to stand this tent up in 15 minutes with my seven year old son on our first camping trip.My only complaint, and this applies to just about every tent made, there is no way this tent will hold 8 people.  I can see it sleeping 6 with some gear but 4 with air mattresses.BTW - It is a big tent so keep in mind that this review is based leisure camping not back packing."],["I haven't got to put the tent through all it's paces yet but here's what I have so far.  As noted by others, set up was easy, just like any other dome tent.  The poles set up with a combination of sleeves and fast setup clips that's a breeze for two and do-able with one.  It rained the whole weekend on this maiden trip so I really didn't get a chance to try the screen porch.  It got wet out there but, setting close enough to the tent wall, some of the items stayed dry.  The tent didn't leak a drop and stood up to some 20 - 30 mph winds.  The zipper door from tent to screen was easy and we used it many times.  The screen porch zipper was fine and has one zipper down the middle so you can get in and out without undoing the whole thing and keeping bugs out.  I need to try it out in other weather and more expeditions but so far I thought it was a great product at a great price."],["I set up my new tent the other day.  I did it by myself (5'4&#34; female) in about 20mins, the flyis the hardest part.  And so far so good.  It has a ton of space, I love the windows and side walls that are screen at least 1/2 way down.The screen section in front is great, just what I was looking for!To be fair, I did not camp in it yet, so can't give it a 5.Another great Coleman product, love their stuff!"],["Wow, I just bought this tent (not from amazon) a couple weeks ago and set it up to waterproof it. I had a Coleman 10x10 for probably 8 years and love Coleman products. We were needing something bigger to fit our growing family. I really liked the screened in area on the front of it; it has a ton of room in there. The inside looks about the same size as my 10x10, I guess it's probably 12x12 and the screened in section is probably 3x12.It was well worth the money."],["I've been camping since I was little, but this is the first tent I've purchased on my own.  I couldn't be happier!  I can't think of one thing to complain about.  Includes directions for setup and takedown.  Setup was super easy.  It was dark when we arrived at our site and were setting up by the light of a lantern, still only took about 15 minutes.  The tent is roomy, love the screen room at the front, the amount of ventilation made the tent very breathable.  May not be the best tent to camp in cold weather since the back area under the rain tarp is all screen, but perfect for the summer camping we do.  Take down was equally as simple.  First time ever I've gotten a tent to fit back into it's original packaging for storage.  I would recommend this tent to anyone looking for something easy to setup and both nice and functional."],["We looked around a lot of places to find the perfect tent for our family and are completely happy with this one.

I would definitely recommend this tent."],["Taking this tent out officially for the first time next week but tested it in our backyard already. Fairly easy setup, it CAN be done with one person but I prefer to work smarter rather than harder so I had my wife help with the poles. There was room for us to sleep on a queen sized air mattress and our two dogs ( one 30 and the other 50 lb) with plenty room to spare. We slept without the rain fly on and it was such a beautiful view. Not bad on the height, I'm 6'2&#34; and just barely had to duck my head inside the main area of the tent. Which, looking back on it isn't really that big of a problem since you'll be sitting or lying down most of the time you're inside anyways. My wife and I both loved the screened in porch too. It gives you a nice place to just sit and relax without having to worry about bugs. We were able to fit one Coleman folding chair on either side with plenty of room to spare in the center. Taking it down was a cinch. The only complaint we really had was that it was a pain to get it folded the right way in order to fit back in the carrying case. Other than that though, we would definitely recommend this tent!"],["My husband and two boys took this camping for a Cub Scout camping weekend.

I was a little nervous about buying a new tent because of the fact that pretty much everything is made in china these days and I was reading reviews of various tents that seemed like many tents are of questionable quality.  I purchased the tent in August 2012 and it is now September.  I've put up/dismantled the tent 5 times.  We've camped in it twice.  I put it up more than camped in it because of course I needed to make sure that I could put it up before camping and then later I put it up after camping because we packed it damp/wet when we left the campgrounds so had to set it up again at home to dry.  It rained both times we camped, although it wasn't a downpour.  We did have an appropriately sized tarp below the tent as well to protect the floor.  We DIDN'T seal it at all.Pros:- Didn't leak (although we were not in a downpour we did get a fairly steady rain one morning).- Setup was easy to figure out and do.  I'm a 5'6\" female and I set it up by myself each time with the exception of the rainfly.  Full disclosure:  I am an engineer though. :)  I might have been able to do the rainfly myself, but I think it would be a pain.  The tent is rather tall.  The first time we set up the rainfly it was 10PM and after one little snafu we got it up (I recommend setting it up first in DAYTIME).- The bathtub style bottom did give me comfort when it was raining.- WE LOVED THE PORCH.  We sat three people in camp chairs in the porch.  Other times it was just nice as an entry way to keep the inside of the tent cleaner.  I threw a little rug down in front of the tent entrance and it worked out quite well.  The main reason sand got in our tent was the kids undressed out of their sand filled bathing suits!- It is HUGE.  It is so nice to have a tent you can stand in, move around in, and get dressed in.  Our kids would have fit in the tent with us, but we chose to have them camp in another smaller tent and we just kept all the clothes and supplies in our tent.- It has a little loop at the top of the tent you can hang a light on.- It has two nice sized pockets which is great for phones, etc.- We were able to stay fairly warm.  The coldest night was about 50 degrees and our sleeping bags were able to keep us warm.  It did heat up during the day, but not as bad as other tents I've been in.Cons:-  I have no idea how to pack the tent so it fits in the bag it came in.  I know it is physically possible of course, but really when you are dismantling a tent, have 3 kids to keep an eye on and are trying to leave a campground on time you want to be able to pack it quickly and easily without having to analyze the one way to fold it to get it to fit.  We just packed the tent in a very large duffel bag.  It isn't worth the aggravation to get it in the small bag.  The instructions are sewn into the tent bag so you'd probably want to use that bag for packaging other items so you have them for reference if you aren't able to remember how to put it up.- When dismantling the tent I found the metal ends of the individual poles would catch on nylon as you were pulling them through.  It was easily overcome by just giving a little tug on the material but it would just be nice if you could pull them through quickly without having to constantly address this.Just Observations:- This isn't a small tent so it isn't a light thing to carry (but if you want a big tent that is to be expected.  Although one of trips was to a music festival and my husband carried it no problem despite our site being quite a walk.- The only unknown is how long it will last of course.  Our old tent was obviously made quite well.  I'm not sure this one will last 20 years like our original but who knows?Happy camping!  It is a great tent."],["I bought this tent due to the fantastic reviews and I have to say that it seems like a really well made tent.  We have set it up in the back yard and has gone through a rain storm and it was dry as a bone.  It set really easily, two of us set it up in 15-20 mins the first time so I can only assume that it will take shorter the next time.  There is plenty of ventilation almost too much, I wish there was a zippable cover for the massive ventilation screen, during the rainstorm it was very breezy in the tent.  The front screened in area is kinda handy for keeping out dirt etc.  Anyway overall I would recommend this tent"],["While camping in this tent we got some heavy rain. The downfall I did not like about this tent is that the rain was coming in the screened in porch area do to the fact that the rainfly is not long enough and does not cover the whole screened in porch area.

Being able to store things easily in the porch is great if you want to keep your tent closed off from bugs, dirt, people, etc.  Its great to leave wet/dirty shoes in and the floor is easy to clean.Very easy to set up, I did with 1 person and it took maybe 10 minutes.I didn't even stake in the tent due to the rocky ground I was on and it was great.I have a queen size double high air mattress in the tent and it fit great with enough room to walk around and store other bags.Enough pockets to keep flashlights and glasses in.It rained pretty hard on us this past weekend and the tent held up perfectly, bone dry inside.The large mesh/open area in the back is great for ventilation and the rain cover, covers it completely.Windows are great inside, its just a perfect tent.If you want a tent under $200 this is the one.  If we didn't have the double high air mattress in, it could Very comfortably fit 4 people on 2 twin size mattress, and with no mattresses 8 people could Squeeze in.Very happy I bought this, Coleman is just a great inexpensive company for the weekend warrior type camper that I am."],["We used this tent and enjoyed it.  Was easy to set up and is a nicely made tent.  The only problem is the zipper on the door was hard to find at night; Especially when you need to get out fast and use the bathroom or something.  The back of the tent added no privacy unless you had the rain fly on the top of the tent to cover the window.  The screen in pourch was not large enough but was great to store supplies for camping.  The only reason that I gave it three stars was because of the open window in the back of the tent."],["The living quarters of this tent are exceptional! I sealed the sent using a spray sealer (no seam sealing) and experienced a night or torrential rain with lightning/thunder and high winds. We did take on some water (small amount) but anyone outside in a tent that night would have.However the screened in porch is very poorly designed and the reason I can't grade this tent any higher. It is slanted back which exposes the whole area to the elements. If it rains at all you will wake up with puddles at your front door (size dependent on amt of rain) that you will have to maneuver through to get out. Also because that portion of the rain fly is somewhat flat, water pools above and begins to drip down into the porch adding to the amount of water.If you are really interested in this tent there is a model that doesn't include the porch that I would suggest looking at instead. Sure you wont have the screened in area (which isn't really usable anyway) but you won't have a floor there to collect the water and it will have a chance to dry out.I am in the process of requesting a return for this product and will not recommend it to anyone."],["Got the tent as ordered and arrived timely. I did not unpack it as the storm was brewing and I did not want to set it up to check it out. Will write a new review in the spring when I take it to to use. I had ordered a different tent last spring and found it too small and it did leak. After a lot of reviews this seems to leak only in the screened area to be expected. It should be rooming enough that we don't get bored sitting out the rain. Will do a spring review."],["Great tent used it this past weekend in the rain it stayed dry the whole time not one drip in rain in the tent"],["The only downfall to this tent is that the back window is completely open unless you have the rain fly on it.  But aside from that I was in a terrible downpour and everything inside the tent was completely dry.  The front porch is really nice because we have dogs and this allows us to clean them off before they come inside without them or us standing in the elements while we do it.  We were also surprisingly warm in the October overnight storm even though there was only the rain fly covering the backside of the tent."],["we love this tent.  we have used it 4 times.  very easy to set up...after we recieved it we set it up in the backyard.  that made setting it up in the near dark very very easy."],["As soon as we recieved this tent we set it up immediately! It was large enough that we were able to fit 2 cots, 2 kid sized air mattresses and a large pack n play and still had room to get in and out and store our stuff. I was actually pretty impressed by the size of the screened porch since it didnt look very large in the picture. We are going to put our pack n play in it during the daytime hours to keep baby out of the sun and misquitos. I would recommend getting better stakes (they just pulled right out of the ground and were pretty cheap). The only negative thing I could comment on is that the sides of the tent to not stake down (just the 4 corners) therefore making the sides blow up slightly with the wind and there is no way to really prevent that. Other then that I would highly recommend this tent!"],["We are car campers and this is perfect for us.  Love the porch.

It rained the first night and the tent held up just fine. There was water collection in the entrance, but otherwise the inside of the tent remained dry...and it rained hard the entire night.

I was able to set this up with great ease just with the help from my 10 year old son. It is spacious and very comfortable. You won't be disappointed!"],["This is a great tent and very easy to set up - 15min by myself.  We camped for a week and experienced sun, rain and wind.  this tent stayed dry and anchored.  I did use 10 in. metal stakes instead of the ones that came with the tent. I especially like the fact that the screened porch has a floor.  Tent was well ventilated and roomy.  We had a queen and a single mattress and 2 coolers inside.  Still had room to walk and change clothes. Glad I purchased this tent!"],["We camped with this tent in the Shenandoahs, overall an excellent car camping tent.  Specifically,Great ventilation, 4 sided sheltered ventilation that prevents feeling stuffy and capture and funnels available wind without letting in rain.Nice vestibule, it's wonderful having a mudroom.  The vestibule has it's screen drains on the outer edges.  Most ground isn't perfectly flat, so just remember that portion should be the lowest.  Yes, the vestibule is not covered completely by the tarp, so it will be wet in a rainstorm, but it's purpose is really to provide you a bug free area to take off your shoes and de-mud yourself prior to entering the tentRoomy.  We had two inflatable queen sized air mattresses and this provided enough room for the air mattresses plus several feet at the bottom of the mattresses for bags, clothes, etc. and room between the mattresses as well.Simple to setup.  One person can do it in maybe 10 - 15 minutes, pounding in stakes, etc.  I did.  It basically is the same dome tent you've all had before, with an extra loop for the vestibule.  if you don't know, stake down the corners after you have unfolded the tent and prior to erecting it.Nice rainfly.  I like it when when a rainfly has good attachments, which this does, attaching to the poles with Velcro and hooks to the rings.  I'd like a bit bigger rings to attach more easily, but overall not bad.  It has also several lines that allow it to be held out for better ventilation and security.A dry experience.  We had a moderately heavy rain and the tent was dry inside, with good ventilation.It does store away well.  Remember how it comes from the factory and fold it in from the sides till you have a very long, skinny section the width of the bag.  Then roll it carefully up, taking your time to ensure the air is removed as you roll it tightly.  I haven't had any issues with repacking it and I've done it several times.oh, get some real tent stakes and dont use the tiny ones that come with it."],["It's nice for the price.  It sets up pretty easy and has the space we like. As for 8 people, sure ifyou are tiny people and don't need any gear except sleeping bags."],["This tent was great for the $119 price, the screened in porch is AMAZING. It creates great airflow with all the windows. But unfortunately we had staked down the rainfly super tightly just like we had read in the reviews, and the tarp flew off during the bad storms we had. I am sure if we would of used more heavy duty stakes it would of been fine, or perhaps the ground was just too wet to begin with.The tent is fairly hard for 1 person to setup, but 2 people it is a breeze.We will try this tent again when we aren't rushing around to get the tarp on in an unexpected storm in the woods, and use the heavy duty 10 inch steel stakes with better results.Update: August 8, 2013After two trips with the tent...the tent pole put a hole straight through the pole sleeve with not much pressure at all. It was quite windy, and even with our new stakes, one of the side seams ripped. I sewed it up with the emergency kit since we were in the woods for several days but I was disappointed with the quality of the seams.  Amazon however sent a new tent and hopefully this one works out better! Still a great tent even sewed up."],["Good size tent.  I don't think 8 people will fit in it though.  We fit 4 in comfortably, with added room for maybe 2 more.  The nice feature about this tent it the little screened awning part.  Makes it nice to be able to step in, take off shoes, sandals, etc and still keep the bedding area somewhat clean.  Sturdy tent, and pretty easy to set up and take down.  The rain flap was a bit odd to fold, but that's probably my error. :)"],["finely made tent for the price - but the rain cover barely does that. Rain came in the back of the tent (which is just screen window - no tent flap to zip up) and filled the front porch with water.

The screened/gate area is great for taking off/storing dirty shoes and drying towels/clothes.  Then you don't have to worry about bugs crawling in your shoes or clothes.  . The only issue I have with the tent is I can never get all the tent parts back in the bag,  They really need to make the storage bags bigger."],["This is an excellent tent.  I have tried many and owned four.  The unusual design intrigued me and their promise of keeping me dry prompted me to try it.  The air flow though the tent with the fly on, is almost as good as with it off.  One mistake with Colemans design is the screen area has a floor but it is not completely protected from rain, so the floor becomes a water collector.  I got a scissors and cut out the floor (in the screen area only).  This has no impact on the tents structural integrity and is, in fact, the way all screen tents are made.  The tent kept us dry in a drenching rain (2 nights).  It can be a tough job to get it back in the very nice bag when you break camp."],["Easy to set up, roomy and quality product. Rain-fly is great added feature.Only drawbacks: 1. two side windows zip up, but no privacy in the back. You can untie the rain-fly and let it fall down the side of the tent, but there's nothing stopping someone from lifting it up from the outside. 2. You have to make sure the porch zipper is closed all the way to keep bugs out. 3. there are two small holes in the floor of the porch to accommodate electric cords, so you're not completely sealed off, therefore not completely bug free.Overall happy with the purchase. Would buy again"],["I love the fact that this tent is super easy to put up and has lots of space.  I also love the built in floor in screened in porch.  The only down side to this tent is the lack of a zip up window in the back.  It means the back window (which is large)  is completely open at all times leaving you zero privacy.  If you have the rain fly on then the window is covered.  But if don't want or need the rain fly you are exposed.  Down here in Texas we often need as much air flow as we can get so we would only put on the rain fly when absolutely necessary.  I hate not being able to zip up a window while I change clothes, etc.  Otherwise this is a really great tent."],["Like many of the other reviewers, I researched and read a lot before making a decision on a tent.  I chose this tent for the following reasons:1. The screened porch.All the tents I looked into buying had a screened porch of some sort.  I really liked the idea of a place to get away from the bugs if need be.  I was indifferent if it had a floor or not.  Both has their advantages and disadvantages.2. The rain flyOne thing that I really liked about the rain fly on this tent was the awnings it created over the windows.  This allows the windows to be open while raining, thus maintaining ventilation.  I also liked the large coverage of the rain fly over the tent and that it followed down to the corners giving a path for water to run off.3. Shape & FloorAfter looking into other shaped tents (square, rectangle, \"L\" shaped etc..) I chose the traditional dome.  It has 3 poles. 2 for the main tent and one for the porch.  This shape is also best suited for windy conditions.  I also was drawn to the tub floor design.  I liked the idea that if water was pooling near the base that it couldn't come in.4. PricePrice was a huge factor in my buying decision.  I wanted to stay under $200.  Sure I found a handful of tents I would have liked to get over this one, but they would have cost 2 to 3 times more.THE TESTAfter it arrived, I set it up in the back yard for a trial run.  Me and my two children (5 & 7) slept in it that night.  Rain was forecast for the early morning and it did.  Here are the pros and cons from that night.PROS:1. SetupSetup is very straight forward.  2 poles criss-cross on the main tent and 1 pole for the porch.  The one piece sleeves really help when threading the poles through the top.  With this size of tent, 2 people make things go much smoother.  Putting on the rain fly almost requires 2 people.2.  RoomyI had a full size air bed that I slept on and the kids were on either side.  There was plenty of room between them and the walls.  Like all tents, the \"real\" number of occupants is 2 adults and 2 children or 3 adults.  I am 5' 10\" and can stand in the center.  I can almost stand in the porch which was a surprise.  The porch floor area was bigger than I was expecting and is a nice place to store a cooler overnight.3.  The AwningsI had both windows partially down and was able to leave them that way when the rain came.4.  Water resistanceI wanted to test the tent in the rain right out of the box.  I did not spray with repellant or did any seam sealing.  The rain started at 4AM and came down nice and steady.  The only water that came into the tent was where the top of the tub floor met the walls of the tent.  Water came in through the stitching so you definitely want to seam seal.  None of us was near the edge of tent so we all stayed dry.  I could see water on top of the rain fly through the mesh roof and nothing was dripping down through.CONS:1.  Porch designI experienced the same things others did when it rained.  There is nothing to keep rain from coming into the porch area and then the floor just collects it.  There was a significant amount of water on the floor of the porch (none of that water entered the tent ).  The flat area of the rain fly that covers the top of the porch had a huge pool that had formed (it was not leaking down through).  I think that if you are going to have a floor for the porch, you need to have a way to keep the rain out.  If it's an open floor, then mesh walls are just fine.  Either have zippered flaps or an extended awning.2. The back window.This is kinda a con.  From reading other reviews, I was somewhat concerned over the back of the tent being mostly open with no zippered flap.  My concern wasn't so much with privacy because I always put on the rain fly even if I know it's not going to rain, but my concern was about ventilation.  If it was a cold night, will we be able to stay warm?  On our test night it got down into the 60's and we all stayed warm in our sleeping bags. I had the door windows closed and the side windows were down a couple of inches.  At one point I opened a side window all the way to see if any rain would come in (it didn't) and I could feel cool air coming in.  So if you close all the other windows it cuts most of the cross ventilation off enough that you can trap some heat, so that's good.  My other concern is if you encounter some wind.  Will it blow right in and be drafty?  It would have been nice to just have a large zippered window instead.Final Opinion.Overall I am happy with the tent and my purchase.  For the price and the features, it's a good value for the money.  The negatives about this tent aren't deal breakers in my opinion and have some workable solutions."],["I ordered it Wednesday, 6/26/13 and, I kid you not, it was on my doorstep the next afternoon! I am completely enthralled with the speedy delivery! The tent looks awesome and I will be trying it out over the 4th of July weekend coming up this week! (you should know I did not spend anything extra to have it literally over-nighted! :)"],["I bought this tent because the one I wanted wouldn't make it in time for a holiday trip, and am pretty glad.  This tent is very roomy and the screened in area is a great extra space.  It is  a great bug free area to relax.  We can fit a whole queen size air mattress and a twin with more than enough room for all the bags.  This is a great family tent!  As far as set up went I don't think it gets much easier.  Three poles and one for the rain fly and it is up.  It is doable alone but because of the size of it, it is most definitely easier with two.  Overall I think it was a great purchase and would recommend to anyone!"],["Only took the tent out once so far but here are my initial observations. Very spacious. Easy set up. Withstood a few hours of light to medium rainfall with no problems. Plenty of air flow through the windows; even with rain fly on. Screen room is very nice to have for storage and keeping mud and dirt out of the main area."],["We camp a lot, in all kinds of weather, and in a variety of climates.  We just returned from our first trip with the Evanston 8.  Over the course of 12 days we had sun, wind, and rain.  We stayed dry inside the tent, however the gear in the screened vestibule didn't fair as well.  The rain fly doesn't sufficiently cover the vestibule.  This only affects your gear inside the screen.  NO water ends up in the tent itself.  My wife REALLY liked the height.  You can stand up in the center of the tent!  This is a huge improvement over the previous tents we have owned.  Set up and tear down were easy.  I can do it by myself in 10 minutes!  The door zipper on our last Coleman tent failed after a couple of camping seasons.  This tent has the same plastic/nylon zipper, so we will hold our breath and go easy on the zipper.  So far so good, but I wish Coleman would invest in a beefier zipper.  The rest of the product is great.  We like the space, the water-proofing in the tent itself, and the easy set up.  Would I buy it again?  You bet!"],["This tent goes up with minimal effort. It takes my 5 year old and I fifteen minutes o assemble. We had no rain leakage during a couple of heavy storms, and we even left the windows open!  This fits a king or queen mattress and luggage comfortably, and would fit a second only if you did not intend on storing anything else in the tent. My first tent had a needle woven through the ceiling, so I contacted Coleman. Three times. They never responded. I contacted Amazon, however, and they shipped me a replacement tent the next day, overnight. We camped with both tents and had no trouble with either."],["I've only used it for one trip so far but I really love this tent. It was easy to setup with two people - I think it would be a little complicated to do solo. The instructions weren't very clear (took us a minute to realize the significance of the colored poles, they're different lengths, duh) but there's nothing complicated about the setup. Once it's up, it's very sturdy.During our trip, it rained... a LOT... the whole weekend. Mud everywhere. We did end up with big puddles in the screened in porch area (due to the slant, the rain comes right in through the front screen) but we had the rainfly on the whole trip and the tent did NOT leak. With all of the mud, it was so nice to have the screened in porch to give us an area to take off muddy shoes. The tent fit our queen size air mattress with a ton of room to spare. There is a hook to hang a battery powered lantern in the top of the tent, and some storage pockets on the tent walls for glasses and incidentals. The screened in porch was a nice place to relax in when the rain came, it didn't start coming through the screen door unless the rain was coming down pretty hard. We had room in the screened in porch for two beach chairs.Minor complaint, the tent wouldn't fit back into the storage bag. But maybe it's me, I've never been able to get a tent back into one of those bags!"],["This was the first tent we have purchased new, and have to say we were not dissappointed.  The first night it rained on us, but the front porch gave us a place to let the dogs sleep without allowing them into the tent.  Also, the tent was large enough that we had a deluxe queen sized airmatress and our 4 year old's play tent set up inside with plenty of room to move around and store gear.  Good airflow if you leave the rain shield off; excellent waterproofing if you leave it on.  Very happy with our big green tent!"],["I did a &#34;dry run&#34; setup in the back yard... 15 minute setup by myself.  The tent is roomy, nice and tall in the middle, has good ventilation and we absolutely love the screened front porch.  We arrived at our campsite as it was getting dark.  Set up the tent in less than 15 minutes with my wife.  Plenty of room for 2 queen air mattresses + our bags in the main tent.  Really a great purchase at a great price.  Amazon pricing and delivery were the best I found.  Paid less than a used tent on craigslist."],["well bigger then i'm used to lol. big enough for at least 2 queen size mattresses. great construction. and i could probably put it up by myself. (havent had to yet) definitely go for a trusted brand and you will be happier with your investment! i certainly am!!"],["I've only used this once, but it held up fine in the light rain we experienced, though I didn't have the chance to treat it in advance.  It handled 4 rowdy boys just fine.  The screened porch was great.  The poles are a little thinner than I'd like, but only time will tell if they last."],["please...let me spare you the pain of buying this crappy tent.  we used ours 5 times, out for 3-4 days on each trip.  on the 5th trip, the main zipper broke.  so called Coleman for support, got nowhere.  since the tent was purchased over 1 year ago, all they would do was offer us 30% off a new tent.  so sad how poor Coleman quality has become and how little they care about customer service.  spend the extra $ and get a tent from LL bean or REI where they will actually stand behind their product."],["So I finally got to put the tent to use this weekend.  Just wanted to share that it was everything we needed it to be.  Having grown up with standard dome tents, I had it out of the box and up, by myself, in about 10-15 minutes.  Would be about 5-10 minutes now that I've done it.  The size turned out to be perfect, not too huge, but definitely big enough for a queen, and two child sized airbeds.  Could definitely fit two queens.  The screen room was everything I hoped it would be.  It adds a ton of flexibility to the tent.  Some people had complained that it was a bit small, but they were mostly commenting on the Evanston 6, which is smaller in general.  Because the 8 is bigger all around, the screen room is just about perfect.  It makes for a great place to throw gear without having to constantly go in-out of the sleeping area.  For example, you can stage gear just by throwing it into the screen room.  Then when you have your shoes off, you can move gear back and forth to the clean areas.  When we woke up this morning the world was wet with morning condensation, but the inside of the tent was dry.  It has very good ventilation, and lots of large windows to control that aspect.  However, those that have mentioned that this is a warm weather tent are correct.  The increased ventilation definitely means that you won't be trapping as much warmth during the night.  So take that into account when planning bags, blankets, etc.  I was nervous to go with Coleman, because frankly their tent reviews in the last few years have been slipping, especially on their other styles.  But I chose this one because the reviews were much better, and because I wanted to stick with a standard dome configuration.  We had a great time, and the tent performed well in every aspect.  The floor is well crafted and of good material.  The seams and zips were all well placed and well done.  No complaints.  Unless one of our kids damages the tent, there is no reason we shouldn't get quite a few good seasons from it."],["Big enough to stand up in, perfect design for airflow and easy set up. Has large open screen in the back covered by the pull over top but stayed dry the during heavy rains."],["Went camping with 2 adults and 2 kids.  We had a Queen air mattress and two kid size air mattresses and still had more than enough room.  This tent was awesome.  Screened in porch is a fantastic feature.  The back wall is about 75% screen with no zip flap, but the rain fly more than adequately covers the screen when installed.  Easy to put up, easy to take down and fold back into the bag all by myself.  No rain, so can't comment on that.  The front porch does have two \"drain\" holes on the back corners, so if it did rain, it would not flood, just would get wet....but it is only a porch!  The stakes are a little small.  I went out and bought 7 large stakes for the main tent.  All together we had 7 kids at our campground and this tent turned into their playground and it held up great!  If I had to do it again, I would buy this tent...100%."],["I did A LOT of research on Amazon and a few other websites before deciding this tent was the one! We have a toddler, so I needed a roomy tent that also wasn't a pain to set up, that could hold 3-4 people and all of their gear for a few days, as well as a pack n play and stroller. This tent was PERFECT for all of those things. It was just 3 of us, but it could definitely fit 4-6 people with plenty of room for all of their stuff and still have room to change, move around, etc. If you wanted to pack in a bit tighter you could probably fit more, I just happen to like my space when camping.  This tent takes 3-5 minutes to set up with two people that are not rushing.  I could probably have set it up myself in 5-8 minutes.  The front porch is great for leaving wet/dirty gear and shoes. The porch will NOT keep your stuff dry if it rains though, but you should be able to tell that by the pic. I imagine a strategically placed tarp could amend that if you so desired. The porch was also great for letting my toddler run around in the tent and to still be able to look outside. I would DEFINITELY buy again!"],["We had not been camping for a very long time, and as we are not getting any younger, really wanted a tent you could stand up all the way in and have room to move around.  This tent met our expectations.  I would give it 5 stars, but it rained all week and the rain fly did not keep the screened in area dry.  I would like to see the rain fly somehow extend a bit further over that part of the tent.  The rest of the tent was nice and dry.  We even had some small hail two days and the inside of the tent stayed dry.  Good tent, lots of room to move around in.  We liked it."],["This is easy to set up, durable and roomy, holds up well in the weather. My favorite feature is the way rain fly, you can leave the windows open at night and no one can see in because the fly covers up their view of you."],["Very spacious inside with our 2 cots and sleeping bag for toddler there was plenty of room for all our things and to move around. The porch was nice for storing our beach things outside the sleeping area. Bring a dust pan because it was hard to sweep out the tent with the porch area. Back window is completely open but is covered with fly on - might not be the best in cold weather. Did not get to test if waterproof, had no rain on our week long beach trip."],["Great tent, though as always 8 people would be a squeeze 6 is doable with not so large people; but there would be some tightness. The screened in area works out well; it gives you a place for shoes, etc when entering the tent and also allows for someone to sit there basically outside but without fear of bugs."],["Feel confident purchasing this quality Coleman Product.  I recently bought one based upon a recommendation from a colleague who had the older version of this tent (in preparation for a Sequoia camping trip).  My wife and I, along with our 4 year old and 2 year old, completed an earlier camping trip with a 4 man tent and struggled because the queen size air mattress took up nearly the entire tent.  The Coleman Evanstan 8 tent, however, has ample room for both a queen size mattress for the parents and a twin size mattress for the kids.  There is enough room left over to stand up (and I'm 6'1\" tall) while changing, and room for the bags and related gear.  The tent is really large; it helps to have two people setting it up as the poles are exceptionally long and flexible (as one would expect).  A great feature of this tent is the screened-in porch area, perfect for removing your shoes before entering the tent.  My wife was 7 months pregnant during our last trip, and even she found this to be a comfortable home away from home.  You should purchase a tarp or appropriate ground cloth to use with this tent, as it's challenging enough to fold it up after collapsing it that you don't need to make it harder by having a wet and dirty tent bottom on top of everything else that usually has to be done when breaking down camp.  The whole thing took me about 15-20 minutes to break down by myself, about 10 minutes to put up with a friend, for the first time, at sundown.  Everything is well constructed, and the storage bag is big enough that if you don't get the folding just right it will still fit with some room to spare.  I also think they nailed it on the sytling, and because of it's shape it is fairly quiet in the wind if tied down well.Enjoy!"],["We purchased this tent for our family to us on camping trips. My wife and I used it this weekend while camping at the beach.  We've always had a small two person tent, and this tent was HUGE!  I tried to set it up in the living room originally but had to move it to the backyard.  We treated it with water repellant and were ready for the trip.Set up is easy, but helps if you have two people.  We purchased a ground tarp at Home Depot (12x16) but think you might be able to find it cheaper online.We slept with the rain fly off every night and the back window was HUGE and gave us a great view of the billion stars each night.The material doesn't feel as thick or durable as our two-person tent (it's a North Face and we paid considerably more for that tent, so we came to expect that)  But for the most part, it was a great tent.The porch was great to have and sit in during the mosquito nights and wet dew mornings.  With all the windows open you get a great cross breeze too.We fit our queen size mattress and a twin in there with no problem, with plenty of extra room for clothes, books, etc.I recommend this tent!  It's HUUUUGGGEEE!!!!!"],["This tent is fantastic for the money. I am glad that we sprung for the slightly larger 8 person version. It was very comfortable and roomy for my wife and I. We were able to sit in the screened in area of the tent and play cards at night with our lantern on without being harassed by bugs. This is a real plus if you don't have a separate screened gazebo or don't have room to bring one with you. The screened area does get wet when it rains so plan accordingly. We brought a small tarp to cover things that we wanted to keep dry in that area. The rest of the tent stayed dry and held up well during the severe thunderstorm that hit us the first night we had the tent set up. As others have said, the screened are serves well as a place to take off your shoes so you don't track dirt into your sleeping quarters. The inside height is advertised as 6 feet but I think it is at least 6'1&#34; or maybe 6'2&#34;. I am 5'11&#34; and I have 2-3&#34; of headroom when standing in the center."],["So far just tried it in the back yard, but it seems about on par for a Coleman product. So far so good."],["This was a perfect size tent for our family of 5.  Plenty of room for queen air bed and 3 speeping bags.  4 stars instead of 5, due to poor design of rain fly over &#34;vestibule&#34;.  No way to really keep vestibule dry if it rains, but rest of the tent stayed dry.  We tucked in the bottom of the vesitbule and that helped some, but you do have to clear shoes/boots, whatever else out of there if you suspect rain is likely."],["I just bought this tent yesterday and the set up was pretty easy, even for a beginner like me. There was a small rip in the vestible area on the floor but it isn't anything critical so I plan on just getting some fabric glue to seal it up. I would say this tent needs two people to set up but is probably doable with one person if they had a lot of patience. The inside area has two pockets and a place to hang a small, lightweight lantern at the peak. I would say I was expecting the inside to be a bit bigger (I was originally shopping for a 6-person tent) but I feel confident you could fit in two queen size mattresses and still have a bit of room for your packs, etc. The vestible area is pretty good size. We were able to easily fit two adult camping chairs in it along with my daughter's child chair. It will be a nice option on buggy nights as you can sit in there but still see a fire or something. Overall we are confident in our purchase. Again, it isn't a tent I'm going to do extreme camping in but it will provide us some great shelter for our car camping trips!"],["Ordered the first tent. 2nd time I set it up, the top of the dome ripped when setting up the fiberglass poles. You did a nice job of quickly replacing it, but set up the 2nd tent - the for the first time - and it  ripped in the exact same spot at the top. Gave up. Tossed some duct tape on it and crossing my fingers. Coleman needs to use a heavier material in the channel sleeves the poles pass through to withstand the pressure of raising the tent. The design is awesome - too bad they didn't use a heavier material."],["Overall this test is fantastic.Easy set up; one person can do it but two is way easier.Take down is just as easy; Ive packed it up a few times now and it always fits in the bag with room to spare.This tent could probably fit two queen beds, we just had one with plenty of walking room on both sides.** If the rain-fly is off the back of the tent is open; while this is wonderful for ventilation it becomes a problem when you are changing if anyone is around..Most important to note, the screen porch.. we used this space as a sort of clean room entrance, keeping shoes and wet clothes and gear there, and using the two doors as twin defense against the army of mosquitoes out to get us.I recommend getting a couple of straps to tie up the tent and rain-fly when rolled up just to make life even easier."],["Tent is everything we were looking for.  Very spacious and with the screen area really keeps the bugs out while sleeping.  Have used it during a couple of storms and stayed dry.  Very easy to setup."],["We bought this tent twice within a one-month span and have now returned both of them.  We first saw the tent at an outfitter store.  It was on the affordable side compared to many of the other options, and we also liked the features - size, vestibule, decent rain fly.  We bought it and set it up once we got home, only to have problems with the interior door not zipping because the material was too tight.  We tried several adjustments to make sure it wasn't a problem with our setup before determining the tent was flawed.  Based on what we read on Amazon and elsewhere, we decided it must have been a fluke and ordered another from Amazon, returning the first one to the outfitter store.  We almost did not set it up before striking out into the great outdoors but decided to set up to seal the seams.  Good thing we did - a two-inch section of the seam joining the wall and the floor did not get caught in the stitching; as a result, the tent had a two-inch hole that quickly grew when any pressure was applied to the material.  We have now returned the second tent to Amazon and moved on to another outfitter, purchasing their brand rather than trying to find another Coleman tent."],["We bought this tent mainly to be used in our homeland Israel, which is defiantly a warm weather.First thing we noticed, It's huge! 2 queen size + much to spare. The screened porch is nice but when the sun raise a bit higher in the sky the floor gets hot as hell.Easy to set up, easy to dismount. Not that easy to fit back into the bag :-) but achievable.Pros: Huge, easy mount/dismount, screened porch is useful.Cons: a bit heavy, floor gets hot in the sun"],["This is much larger than we expected which is awesome for our family. We tried to measure out the footage listed on amazon but it ended up being larger. Can really fit 8 people without a doubt."],["I bought this to go camping with my girlfriend & her 3 kids.  It was the kids' first camping trip, so I wanted it to be a good experience.I did waterproof the tent before going, but after 6 days of on & off heavy rain, we stayed completely dry.  There were puddles in the tarp under the tent, yet nothing came in.  It was windy, yet nothing came in the screen in the back.  I was EXTREMELY happy with that.  It poured one night, which was loud, but we stayed completely dry.The screen room in the front was awesome.  We established a rule that shoes must be taken off & left in the screen area.  That allowed the main tent area to stay completely clean even with 6 days of rain.  I loved this tent!My only issue is the size.  I wanted to use 2 queen air mattresses.  They had to be completely touching in the middle, and they came close to the sides of the tent.  I did have double-high mattresses, and with the angle of the tent walls they barely fit.  There could be no other mattress in there with the 2 queen mattresses.  I'm sure if I got single-high mattresses that would have allowed me to push them out a little bit, but this isn't a realistic 8 person tent.  This was a tight 5 person tent.  I thought it was a 12x12 dome with a 3' screen room, but the screen room was probably about 4'.  So the mattresses came within about 2 1/2 - 3' of the front of the tent.So if this tent is the right size for you, it's a great tent."],["the main thing that sold me on this tent was the screened area...having now camped in it, i will just say i LOVE the screened area!...it is extremely handy, it served as our little mud room, and kept the inside of the tent so much cleaner, and kept bugs out...a fantastic feature.  it's probably about three feet deep, leaving you with a large square area inside the tent...we fit a pack n play, four sleeping bags, and all of our bags and had room to spare.  my eldest son slept in his own tent, but he would have fit in with us no problem, making our total beds/gear six people's worth...plenty of room.  we set up this tent in the almost dark, very easy to set up, i set it up by myself when we got it, to seal the seams.  it rained (poured, actually) on us, and we stayed dry, despite the fact that we set up our tarps very poorly, and actually had water pouring off the edge of one and running right under the tent.  the tent was only partially covered by a tarp, the rest was just protected by the rain fly, and like i said...we stayed dry. the screened porch area of course got wet, being enclosed by screen...and being left open due to our poor tarp set up...i would absolutely recommend this tent to folks.  i can think of no complaints."],["firstly I really love the design and therefore shipped it all the way to Singapore (shipping cost me US$100+).BUT, on the first night with heavy rain and strong wind from 1 side for around 3 hours, the sleeping area are flooded with water although with rain fly properly secured!!!Well , this is my first time buying tent and i did not treat it with any \"sealer\".

In our case, the window fabric was sewn to the window screening.  You could unzip the window, but it stays put.  Worse, it's clear that the stitching will tear the window screening.  Fine... But I HAD to use it.  So now I have to hassle with returning an obviously used tent.I also have mixed feelings about the screened porch.  I really like the overhang, but the floor area gets dirty very, very quick.  As well, the waterproof ground cover simply collects rain and, in turn, creates mud.The last issue is truly minor, but a real frustration.  My previous tent folded nicely and fit into the bag it came in.  The Evanston 8?

We were definitely able to keep bugs out of the tent.  The only thing I don't like is that the back side of the tent is complete mesh.  We didn't get to try this out in rain to see if the rain fly would keep the back side dry, but having that back side exposed does worry me a bit.  Also if you want privacy, you have to have the rain fly on or other campers can see right into your tent.

Easy to set up for my wife and 12 year old grandson."],["First off, this thing is massive. We tried to set this tent up in our apartment living room and it didn't fit.We went camping a few weeks after receiving the tent. It comes in it's own carrying bag and it's heavy. Since we tested the tent (as best we could in our living room), we were able to set it up with relative ease. The large windows allowed for a lot of air flow to keep the temperature down inside. The rain fly fit was snug. Per the usual, there were 2 pockets on either side of the tent for belongings. The space this tent afforded us made our camping trip so much more comfortable. Inside we were able to fit a full size air mattress, a small folding table, 2 tubs, 2 bags for clothing, and a large kennel (for 2 dogs). We still had room to walk around! This description doesn't even include the front covered patio.The patio is a great feature in this tent. We were able to fit 2 camping chairs with room for more. It kept the bugs away. The best thing for us was that it created a mud room. For those who have gone camping before, you know how much is sucks to have to take off your shoes outside of the tent and leave them out there. This screened patio is a great feature that allows you to keep your shoes outside of the main room while still being protected from the elements and insects.Definitely buy this tent if you have a large family or just want to be more comfortable when you camp. You will not be disappointed."],["This tent is great.  The porch area works great for taking shoes off and keeping the dirt out of the sleeping area.  We came into high winds last time we were camping and the tent held up perfectly.  I did however invest into some upgraded stakes."],["My family purchased this tent over a year ago. The fist thing we did when the tent was received was seal all the seams and buy a tarp for under the tent. We have gone on about five camping trips since then and it has held up beautifully. We have had plenty of rain and cold night and not one drop of water has seeped in. When the top cover is on it stays plenty warm, when its off it stays plenty cool, we do bring a small space heater and fan just encase though. This is a wonderful family tent. I can stand up straight weather I am in the tent or the enclosed porch which is awesome. This is a eight man tent but it would be a little cramped for that many. Me, my wife, our German Shepherd and my one year old son with his play pin fit easily inside with extra space for at least 2 more children. This tent is going to bring us years of fun.

Overall its a good looking tent with a great patio."],["We order ordered this tent after buying the Evanston 6 and seeing that we needed a little more room. The  size is just right. It is not too big for most tent pads. The tent floor is 10x12 and the porch is a little over 4ft. We have 2 queen air matresses in it with plenty of room to spare. Pthe porch is so nice. The tent seems to be made well but there are a few things that Coleman should have done. The entire rear of the tent is just mesh that is great for summer camping but so bad for privacy if don't want to use the rainfly. There should have been extra stke down points on the sides there is a third on the front and back though. A gear loft up top like several other tents have. A second ring where you stake down the Tent, by the Time youhave the poles connected and rinfl y hooked theres not much room.That's rally about all the negatives so far. No real dealbreakers. I can't vouch for the weather proof ness till we try it in the rain. The tent does fit back in the bag well. I folded it up with the rainfly and was able to fit it all in the bag with poles and stakes and room, for my extra stakes. You just have to fold it neatly and get all the air out and it will fit just right. I'm sure the tent will hold up just fine. We are looking forward to putting it to heavy use.

I went back and forth between several different tent models, but ultimately decided that the rain fly looked to have better coverage on this model.Setup is relatively quick and took about 15 minutes. It could be done by one person, but two people would be optimal. The screened in area was more useful than I thought it would be.  We basically used it as a mud room and it helped in keeping dirt and debris out of the sleeping area. With my family of four, there was plenty of room for two queen size air mattresses with space left over to store other items. There are two small pockets on each side of the tent to store small items and a small strap in the top-center of the tent to hold a light, fan, or whatever you can fit up there.  The ventilation was quite good and we stayed cool with ~75F nights. It rained a small amount on both nights and we stayed completely dry.Overall, I'm really happy with my purchase."],["The tent is nice, but if you are going to use it in a windy situation, the stakes provided won't hold the tent or th rain shield in the ground.Purchase heavy duty stakes too!"],["I LOVED the sun room.  We used it camping on the beach this weekend.  It did not stand up to the wind great.  We were camping on sand, so the stakes did not stay in great, and the rainfly basically just pushed into the tent, halving the space inside.  When I took the rainfly off it was much better.  That said, with the rainfly off, the entire back is completely exposed so there isn't any privacy and all of the sun comes in.  Overall, I'm still happy with the purchase and would do it again, but go in with open eyes."],["Was never really a big fan of Coleman tents due to the very heavy weight of the fiberglass poles, but for the price of them I get it.That said, I was pleasantly surprised by this tent, even alone it was easy to put up and held up very well in a heavy downpour with strong gusty winds, even when two tree branches came down on it! It's very roomy for 2 and still comfortable for 4 if you must but at 1 person it's a palace!!! There have been some complaints on the screen room from being slanted in-ward at top and rain getting in to build up of water in the floor. I myself did not have any problems, yes the rain will come in but I have to say I know why they did it, in my opinion at least. The views are incredible from laying on a pad on the floor. My Coleman 4 in 1 mattress pump died so I used my backpacking pad which is only 3\" high and with the door open to the screen room I could see the whole sky. Watching the lighting and the rain come down the trees waving, it was really cool & scary at the same time!! Ha ha. Totally worth a little rain in the screen room area, the rest of the tent was bone dry. To maximize the useable area in the screen room I also used 2 backpacking chairs from Alite Mantis, which gave serious head room along with 2 dogs and a 70 QT cooler with room left over. The built in awnings over the windows in the main tent are nice to keep rain out but do block your view a bit. One tip when pitching tent if you make the area on the floor at back of screen room to tight the floor will raise up a little and you'll be tripping on it going in and out of main living quarters. Yup, I made it too tight!! Also would probably replace guy line with reflective ones for night time trips to the potty or if you drink a lot of alcohol!! I agree that replacing the tent stakes is a must for a strong secure pitch. The photos are just more for seeing it pitched, not so much for stuff inside it as it was a quick test run before a trip. Hope they help. Oh and the grey poles with rubber tips are for the peak to open the awnings up."],["Nice tent, quite large. The vestibule is a great addition, and big enough to hold 2-3 camp chairs + packs etc.The main area of the tent can hold 2 queen-size mattresses side-by-side, plus a twin at the foot of those, and still have some room left for packs/gear. Everything stayed dry when in rained.The vestibule is screened, but only partially covered by the rain fly -- packs etc. need to be up close to the main tent wall to stay dry.The tent is immense and an unusual shape, so you'll need at least two tarps to lay down as ground cover (if you do that sort of thing).This tent is wholey unsuitable for backpacking -- it is heavy and would consume an entire pack to carry. For car camping it's great.The side walls unzip for ventilation. The back wall is just screen, so privacy for changing will be an issue, especially if the rain fly is off."],["When I was a kid, tents were a tedious chore to put up. Usually heavy, not very water proof, and crude.This tent could be the Taj Mahal by comparison. 3 or 4 collapsible poles make erecting the tent simple. The screened area is great for taking shoes off so that you don't get dirt and bugs into your sleeping quarters."],["What else can you say about a tent that lives through 4 days and 5 inches of rain with nothing more than a little inside condensation?  As others have said, the porch area did get wet; but this could be avoided by putting a tarp over the tent, which is often done is rainy weather anyway.  The interior was comfortably roomy for a family of 2 adults and 3 kids, and the porch area kept the interior from getting muddy even in these horrendous conditions.  It was easy to put up, and the hardest part about taking it down was folding it small enough to go in the carry bag.  Not sure I would choose this tent for cold-weather camping, but only a die-hard camper would do that anyway.  I would highly recommend this tent."],["I took my 4 kids to the Smokies for their first camping trip and they had a blast. The tent suited us perfectly and they are wanting to go again soon. I waterproofed it good prior to our trip and it kept us nice and cozy inside as storms roared outside. Like other tents I've had, occupancy is more comfortable with less people. Who can sleep like sardines in a can, especially with squirmy kids all around you.  We had 5 (1 small adult and 4 young teens) and I wouldn't want to sleep more in it.  The screen room in the front was great for keeping dirt and mud out of the sleeping area. However, the way the bottom of the screen room extends past the rain fly top causes it to get wet and it didn't drain. I dried with a towel. I got a rogue tent fly from the Coleman outlet and will figure out additional coverage to remedy this. I had a tarp under the tent but the campground owners advised me to remove it so the water would drain through the gravel tent pad. One son moves a lot during sleep and wore a small hole in the tent bottom so I'll be repairing the hole and using my tarp in the future.  I like the ease of set up especially The hook and ring design-awesome. The big windows are nice, wish the back one zipped up too but the rain fly covers it good. Having stash pockets inside was a nice feature but more would be nice. Broke camp in a downpour and the whole inside got wet because the back window and top of tent are mesh without zippered closure. It dried fairly quickly in my dads basement. And is ready to go on the next trip."],["Wife and I just went camping with our 75lb lab and loved this tent. The vestibule is great and it had plenty of room for double twin mattresses and a dog bed. Easy to setup, but would definitely recommend the nicer 9&#34; stakes for this tent. Great airflow will make this an awesome warm weather tent."],["I purchased this tent for a weekend camping trip and couldn't be happier with it.  It is made well, and set up easily.  I really like the screened in porch area as well!  I am not sure if it will truly fit 8 adults, even if you stored all your gear in the porch area. I think it would fit 6 adults though comfortably.  It is a palace if just used by a couple of people.  I highly recommend this tent and gave it 5 stars!  Enjoy!"],["As a long time camper, I thought that we could rely on the Colman name. Not so much. This tent is now 2 years old, almost to the day, and leaks in a light rain. It was said earlier that the porch is a design flaw, it is. No amount of site prep can fix this flaw. We had another Coleman, that we had perhaps 5 years, that was built better and lasted longer however it had pole issues. So between these two tents, I am sorry to say, \"Goodbye Colemna, I had hoped for better.\"The positive, it is REALLY good at keeping out the mosquitoes."],["Arrived on time. Worked great!"],["This thing is bomber.  Huge doesn't cover it, there is plenty of room for even the most sprawling and prolific out there.  It went up easily, though the fly took a bit of work to do on my own.  It really needs a couple people to get back down again, it holds air in the extremities - cue wife lying on tent while I rolled it up.  All in all, most happy.  I'd buy again."],["We bought this for our trip to Mammoth Lakes. It worked out very well for us. It slept 4 comfortably with luggage in tow. We were fans of the screened patio area where we could keep our shoes and most of the dirt out of the main section of the tent. The only complaint we had was the the flooring from the patio area lifted high from the ground and became a tripping hazard in the dark. It may have been as a result of how tight we anchored down the tent, or it could be do to the design.Either way we slept well, tear down and assembly were easy, and we got it home in one piece."],["Was very easy to set up with 2 people. Because it's the 8person tent, I'm not sure I could set it up on my own (single Mom) - I'll have to update this when we camp next year!It was nice & spacious. Kept us dry during the rain storm, although I didn't like how wet the front room got because the tarp was a strange fit - I'm still not sure we had it on there right. Hope you figure it out LOL. Of course, it never goes back in the bag the same as it started :)"],["I've had this tent for 2 years now and all I have to say about it is good. (I mistakenly put this same review on the 6 man tent, I have the 8 man)I use it as a 4 season tent and frequent the Uintah Mountains. I've had it in high winds, torrential rains and even work up with 6 inches of snow on top of it.It will fit 2 queen sized air mattresses, but I like my space, so I only use 1 queen air mattress and have room for chairs inside as well as in the screened off porch area.I have had some cold nights in this tent, and while I know it wasn't intended to be a 4 season tent, it holds it's own. (Especially when you compare the price of it to the 4 season tents.)One additional note, it is big enough that you can pitch the tent and then pitch a 4 person tent inside it! I've done that as an experiment when the weather was saying lows in the teens (Fahrenheit). It made a huge difference in keeping warm.

The first time we used this tent it rained hard for 10-12 hours.  Didn't leak a drop though we did get a little condensation on the fly.  We opened both windows a little and that took care of the problem.  Best part of this tent is the door!  Wonderful addition to a nice, roomy tent.

Rained 1 night, no problems with leakage. Would recommend this tent to anyone. Good value for the money."],["I ordered this tent because I camp for several days in a row. I was lazy and got tired of zipping and unzipping regular tent doors. I am so happy with this tent. It is very roomy. I tell all of my friends to get this tent."],["Whenever I read a review this good, I always think that some body is working for the company so first let me assure you that I don't work for Coleman or Amazon. I ordered our new tent on Memorial Day and it arrived on the 3rd. GREAT SHIPPING! My son in law came to get our granddaughter at 5 and we set it up. It took us 40 minutes because the directions aren't crystal clear, but using the picture and my minimal knowledge of tents it went together. Next time will probably be 15 minutes. Anyway....the weather called for 0% chance of rain so I figured it could go up and be sealed, but within 30 minutes of going up we had the most \"Gawd awful\" storm I've seen in quite some time. The winds were bending over the maples in our yard so I looked out the kitchen window and the tent was flying. All the tent stakes with the exception of 3 rainfly stakes had come out of the ground and the tent looked like a tethered balloon hovering about 18\" off the ground and was being whipped around so hard I actually thought of the wizard of oz. The sides were bending in and the rainfly was flapping and I thought \"That's the fastest I've ever lost $200,and I'm going to have to go back to looking for a tent again.\" ( I spent several months reviewing and looking at tents that would hold all 6 of us and keep all the whiners happy over our two week camping trip through the mid west.) But anyway, the rain and hail subsided after an hour and a half, so I  went out into the yard expecting a foot of water in the tent and rips throughout. NOT A DROP OF WATER! The tent was askew, the stakes out of the ground, a couple fiberglass tent poles were undone and flattened and the tarp underneath had blown out, but NO water. I'm amazed. I don't know how well it's going to work over a two week period but I'm sold. It hasn't been sealed yet, but I did get better tent stakes and will carry a plastic sheet or something to cover the extensive mesh top and keep heat in at night because it gets coooold in the desert at night, but I've made up my mind that I really love this tent! Who would have thought something made in China could make me happy?? We're ready to hit the road at the end of the month and I don't have to research tents anymore!The 12x12 is hard to find, but the smaller versions are everywhere. Buy it and love it!"],["I spent days going in and out of stores, reading online reviews, and biting my nails over what tent to buy.  It finally came down to this one and I could not be happier.  We had some rain but stayed completely dry.  The hinged door is a blessing with a 4 yo and a 6 yo who have difficulty manipulating tent zippers.  We had plenty of room for us 4, our clothes, and then some.  I was afraid that the only place adults could stand completely upright at was in the very center but the side walls actually go up quite high making it really easy for grownups to move around in.  I did find this tent later (in blue) in a store for about $40 less.  However, I love the green color and I was just done shopping so I do not feel like I paid too much for it.  It was still a great buy."],["We recently spent two nights in this tent up in New Hampshire.  I did do a test-run before our trip, just to have an idea of what I needed to do and how much time was involved.  I was able to set the tent up solo, and my 5 yo daughter was all I needed to get the fly on (after reading some reviews, I didn't even attempt this myself).  The tent is a great size, but I didn't realize just how great until we got to New Hampshire.  The site we had was rather small so the tent took up a lot of it.  But we were camping with another family and spent most of the time on their site so it did not matter much.  We easily fit our family of five, with lots of room to change and move around.  Our set up included 2 air mattresses - 1 queen, 1 double, a pack and play, and lots of bags.  The tent was very roomy, side to side and top to bottom.I loved the door!  As I mentioned, we are a party of 5 including 3 kids ages 5, 2 and 15 months.  The door was perfect for them, and completely beats having a zipper to zip and unzip, zip and unzip, zip and unzip.  Our door wasn't perfectly aligned, so I always had to pick it up slightly to properly close it.  But even without the lift, it was closed enough so bugs could not get it - just the velcro wasn't spot on.  I wouldn't take any stars off for that.  The convenience of a hinged door vs. the zipper is huge, and made our stay that much more enjoyable.It did rain in the middle of the night during our first night there -- just a steady rain.  Nothing too heavy and no strong wind.  I didn't waterproof the tent, but no leaks anywhere. Even the chairs, stroller and shoes that we had left outside under the canopy were still dry too.The tent did get hot during the day and its not very convenient to have to take the rain fly on and off.  There was a little ventilation but I could see how it could get very uncomfortable at night on very hot days.I was torn between this and the Montana 8, but in the end chose the Evanston and am very glad I went with this model.  I can definately see us using this tent for several years."],["As many have mentioned their is no rear cooler port on what you receive when you buy this tent.  Why don't they fix the graphics so people are getting what they see in the advertisement?  Otherwise it is quite nice, and set up fairly easily.  Can be done by one person with patience, but a helper is nice.  Does leak a little where floor joins sides, especially in corners.  Buy a little bottle of seam sealer and seal corner and floor seams when you first set it up.  Fly is perfect... no leaks.  Small electrical port is by left lower corner of door when you are facing the tent.  Nice feature."],["I suppose this tent might work for light duty but it ripped as I was assembling it for the first time. My impression is that it is good for a KOA or very developed site.

My kids set the tent up and said that it was pretty easy."],["Used the tent several times, twice in the rain.  The first rain was a moderate rain and the tent leaked.  Afte that, I sprayed the rain fly with water proofing made for tents.  The second rain was heavy and the tent still leaked.  Will probably buy a tarp to throw over it when camping.  The tent is very roomy and generally good, but water proof it isn't."],["This tent is exactly what I was looking for.

It should be as good or better."],["I know Coleman is a reliable company, I always want the best I can afford and shop for the best price available.

Would recommend this tent to anyone :))))It poured down rain and never leaked either..."],["Bought this tent for a family outing, my wife, and 2 kids. We had plenty of room for all of us and all gear. The first night camping the tent collapsed in very hard midwestern thunderstorm. I do not fault the tent one bit because I didn't put the guy lines out. Hard to believe that those little ropes do so much. After drying the tent out and putting it up the proper way we got another storm that afternoon, things were much better this time. The tent held up great in the wind and rain. The only water we got in the tent was from the rain blowing so hard that it was whipping under the rain fly. Still wasn't enough to worry about. Plus I even got everything bag in the bag, which surprised me. All in all great tent and wouldn't worry one bit about buying and using it. Also the door flap is great idea for some one camping with kids."],["The tent is perfect for my needs.  It is roomy ! the floor has welded seams that appear to be sturdy. I camped in it in 94 degree weather and the vent system was adequate with a fan moving the air around. However, it rained hard for an hour and afterwards there were little droplets of water on the underside of the rainfly that dropped onto my bedding. Next camping trip I will apply some type of sealer to the rainfly. Structurally the tent barely flexed in 20 mph winds. I really liked the front awning . It kept a large and a medium size cooler shaded. Also I was able to store other items in bins out of the rain,with plenty of room to enter and exit the tent. I would have rated it at five stars if there were no leaks ! I will order from Amazon in the future due to the fast shipping process."],["Thought I would wait and see how this tent fares with inclement weather before posting a review. Well several storms later I am pleased to say the tent has held up well although before sealing some seams it leaked badly. The primary points of leakage for me were the A) seam all around the tent where the floor is sewn to the sides B) the corner stakeouts and C) a hole from a missed seam along the side and floor. The fly on my tent was very nicely taped at the factory but leaked where the velcro pole straps were sewn on after taping. After seam sealing all these areas the tent works well. It is surprisingly stable in gusts as long as it is properly staked and guyed.Setup is easy with two people and the hinged door is very handy. The tent ventilates well and is not at all claustrophobic inside so in most ways it's a winner. So why three stars? I took off a star because of the missed seam (quality control issue) and questionable waterproofness from the factory. I took off another star because my tent did NOT have the rear access/ventilation door at the bottom as described by Amazon.This is a decent product for the price, and the occassional camper."],["Just received my tent and set it up for the first time. With a Queen air mattress there is still plenty of standing room and I am 5'11\". Most tents of this height only allow you to stand in the middle due to the curvature of the tent. the hinged door is the best part of the tent. The zipper for the door pole is kind of dumb because it is right by the zipper to close the door and the door seems to sag unless zipped. The tent seems to be constructed well but I haven't run into any severe weather yet. I plan on seam sealing the tent and waterproofing it but that is standard for any tent if you want to stay dry. I will report back after several trips to tell how it stands up. The only two things that I don't like about this tent is that it is difficult to get back in the bag, but that is pretty standard, and I wish that you didn't have to tie it off. I camp at a lot of music festivals with thousands of people and tent strings at night are a recipe for a torn rain fly. Also I plan on purchasing a tarp to place under the tent and a 12' x 12' tarp is difficult to find. It would also be cool if this tent had a gear loft and came with quality stakes."],["I received my tent last night and immediately set it up.Initial Inspection:- All parts were included and the construction looks to be quality.- The fly is taped- The floor is a poly tarp material which looks like it will be durable.- The screen does not look to be \"noseeum\" quality but a more course screen material.  After inquiring about this with Coleman, I was informed that the screen is indeed no-see-um technology as are ALL Coleman tents.  After looking at the screen again, it has a rather course screen with finer fibers woven into it. I'll update if I ever get bit by a no-see-um in my tent.Setup:-It took me 20 minutes to do alone the first time including untying the guy lines and staking it down.  The tent is intuitive to set up for anyone who has set up a dome tent before.Leak Test:- It rained lightly right after I set up the tent. 30 minutes and no leaks.- The rain stopped and I wasn't convinced so I set up the sprinkler like I do for all of my tents.- After 1 hour which was about 3/4\" of \"rain\", the corners of the tent leaked as did the seams where the floor meets the tent walls.  I will need to seam seal that seam for sure.- There was one drop of water on the screen which came through the fly in the top center of the tent.  I need to pull the fly off and inspect for defects. There was some slight pooling so I need to recheck my setup to ensure it is set up correctly as suggested by the Coleman Customer Service.General Observations:- The \"porch\" area is large and keeps the weather off of the door.  It would make a great place for 2-3 people to sit in the shade or out of the rain.  It could also be used for gear storage, but I wouldn't put anything out there that can't get wet as a wind in the wrong direction would blow the rain under the fly.- The door is convenient and the main reason I bought this tent.  My 2 year old daughter was able to go in and out unassisted.  The door does sag a little but there is Velcro in three places to keep it from flapping in the wind or anything and it seals up reasonably well.  I would still zip the door shut when leaving for the day or overnight.- The windows are large and allow nice ventilation but zip up for cold or privacy.The electrical access port is located on the front of the tent and has a flap covering it so water can't get in.  It also has a zipper when not in use.- The walls on the sides taper up fairly quickly so if you are planning to put cots in the tent your usable space is not 12'x12', but more like 9.5'x9.5' at 20\" off the ground.  I think all large tents should include a 20\" off the ground measurement for those that use cots or double high inflatable mattress'.- I figure I can sleep on my cot and put 4 - 5 kids in the tent without anybody touching each other in the middle of the night.- My tent did not come with the \"Cooler Door\". I didn't deduct stars for this, but just thought I would mention it for those who are interested as it seemed to be a hot topic in other reviews.- I will use the tent after sealing it up. If I can get this tent to be waterproof, I will need to update my rating to at least 4 stars.Overall:- This tent doesn't initially look to be the quality of my Kelty Traildome 6, which is a 10'x10', but for the casual camper who won't take the tent in extreme conditions (heavy rain) I think it is a decent tent.  I should note that My Kelty leaked initially as well but was OK after sealing the very same seam.- I must also remind myself that it did not cost as much as my Kelty.- It is a great family tent for good weather.  I would not take this tent on my week long trip to Canada in a primitive campground until I test it further close to alternative sleeping arrangements.- Did I mention I like the door?Coleman Support:I just finished Chatting with Dona on Coleman Support Chat.  What a wonderful experience.  She was responsive, helpful, and polite.  I needed to ask if sealing the seams on my tent would void my warranty. She promptly answered my inquiry and gave me some helpful hints about making sure my guy lines are as tight as possible. She also indicated some other options for keeping the tent waterproof which really surprised me.  I asked about the bug ratings of the screens and she offered to get me the specs and send them in an email.  I also interacted with Ron on the chat yesterday regarding any initial treatments for the tent.  I had an equally pleasant experience with him.  Customer Service is alive and well at Coleman and I felt the need to give them two thumbs up as we are often too quick to complain about bad experiences and overlook exceptional experiences like I have had.Update 06/25/12:-I sealed the seams on the tent body which leaked originally and set up the sprinkler again.  This time I let about 2\" of rain fall on the tent and it looks like 98% of the leaks are fixed.  As a matter of fact only one corner leaked.  It was the last corner and I was running out of sealer so I think it will be fine after I put some more on it.  Actually, it only leaked 1 tsp of water.  If I can make it through a 2\" rain storm with 1 corner leaking that small amount, I think I will be pretty happy.  I've increased the score to 4 stars for this reason.- I did notice a tear in the screen on the door about 1/2\" long.  I can't be sure this tear was there when I got the tent or if it was from the kids or something else since I had the tent set up in the yard for a few days so I'm not deducting any points.- folding the tent back up into it's original bag was not an easy task.  I usually like to carry an extra tarp and hammer, as well as an extension cord and a small fan so I always pack my tents into larger duffel bags anyhow.- I did find with a tent this large when packing it up in the wind that If I left the upwind side staked down it made it a lot more manageable.  Even when I folded the tent, I would fold a corner in, and temporarily stake it down to keep it where I wanted it.  This made tear down a breeze.- I'll be using the tent at a cottage next week and will update if there are any significant discoveries, otherwise, my review stands.Update 07/09/12:After using this tent for a week I have changed my review back to 3 stars for the following reasons:- after being set up for a few days, the door began to sag and not seal well, you had to lift it and close it to ensure the Hook and Loop would support the door.  When the kids went in and out there was a 1/2\" gap at the top of the door allowing mosquitoes in.- The tent did ok in short spells of light rain, but we had a couple of big dumps in which the tent did not perform well.  The rain really came down for 3 hours.  When the drops hit the fly, it is almost like they would come right through as there was a constant mist while it rained.  This was probably an inch of rain per hour for 3 hours (It was REALLY heavy rain).- The rain runs off the fly and onto the tent wall, which is not waterproof.  I will need to spray the tent body with the same waterproofing spray Coleman Recommends using on the outside of the fly.- I still believe this tent is ok for the casual camper but I would not take it for a week long trip if rain is expected.- Temperatures were highs in the upper 90's during the day and down into the upper 60's at night.  This tent breathed well.  It got up over 100* inside the tent during the day with the sun on it, but once it was in the shade and/or the sun went down, it cooled down well with the outside temperatures. I have had tents that hold the heat in ,but with the big windows and the screen in the top of the tent, this one performed well."],["Bought this for my grandson.  He loves it.  The same tent at walmart was $30 more this really is a 8 man tent, its huge easy set up easy tear down and coleman quality throughout."],["I recieved this tent as a Christmas present and just used it for a week camping trip.  It was only two of us but we were able to have a great set-up inside the tent.  It rained half the time and there were only a few drips inside the tent.  Overall it rated great.  This is my first tent and it only took me 15 mintues to set-up and the construction seem to be well done.  I love the door and the screened windows.  I would recommend this tent for any family.  Well made product."],["please...let me spare you the pain of buying this crappy tent. we used ours 5 times, out for 3-4 days on each trip. on the 5th trip, the main zipper broke. so called Coleman for support, got nowhere. since the tent was purchased over 1 year ago, all they would do was offer us 30% off a new tent. so sad how poor Coleman quality has become and how little they care about customer service. spend the extra $ and get a tent from LL bean or REI where they will actually stand behind their product if it fails."],["The cloth is a little thin, but for the price it is excellent.  Very easy to assemble and comfortable/convenient.  It is big!"],["The hinged door and bath tub style floor are what sold me on this tent.  So far so good.  No water in the tent when it rains.  Plenty of air flow.  Great for sleeping out in the summer.  Great price."],["My husband and I bought this tent for the two of us. Even though it says it's for 8 people, you could probably only get 4 in there comfortably. If it's only for two people, it's very roomy. My husband is 6'2'' and he could fully stand up in the middle of the tent.We set up the tent in less than an hour. Clear directions.The rain cover is very good, we ended up camping during a few severe thunderstorms and there was very little rain that got into the back corners of the tent.I would definitely recommend this product!"],["I purchased this tent because I liked the idea of having a hinged door.  Tent was easy to put up, hinged door was great, and tent had a lot of room.  Only has window in back and front.  Wish I would have looked into a Coleman with 4 windows.  Over all a great tent."],["Took this out this last weekend for 4 days/5 nights and it held up great!!!  I did waterproof it right after I set it up and it held up to almost 3 full days and nights of rain.  Not a drop came in the tent.It is pretty heavy and the bag that it comes in is a joke as far as being able to pack the tent back in after use, but I will be buying an over sized duffle bag to pack it in from here on out.I love the large size and being able to stand up in it is great.  The covered &#34;porch&#34; area does cover a lot of room and I could have shoes outside the tent while it was raining and they wouldn't get wet.It does take a bit to set up and having two people is ideal, although one person can set it up, just takes longer.Overall I was really happy with it and I would recommend this tent to anyone!"],["There are some nice aspects about this tent:  the size is HUGE, the 'porch' area is bigger than I expected, the bathtub style floor is nice.  BUT, I didn't like how high the windows were for airflow as well as visually, the &#34;door&#34; wasn't really necessary and wasn't a big draw, and the rain shield was super thin.  Overall just an &#34;ehh&#34; rating.  Probably won't try a Coleman again."],["We needed a bigger tent since we are tall people 6'3&#34;, and 5'9&#34;, with two growing kids.  I set the tent up and water proofed it, but after a light Seattle rain with some wind the floor tub took on quite a bit of water.  Not a flood, just enough to make your stuff wet on the floor, and a bit uncomfortable if we were actually camping in it.  I think I will have to reseal the seams down there.  The poles are of good quality but the fabric and flooring seem a bit thinner than what I would expect.  Maybe the equivalent of a cheap Target brand tent.  Putting it up, I could do by myself except you will need help with the tarp, it is big and a bit complicated.  The awning over the back window is a pain, it is a small pole that fits into two rivets on the tent.  This pole does not stay in the rivets, it is always falling out, without any wind or disturbance.  It seems like that maybe the pole is too short?  I haven't decided what I am going to do about this, yet.  The swing door is a really nice touch, especially for kids:)  Overall, we do fit, and the tent does have a year warranty so if it does not make it through the summer it is going back. If I had a bit more money to spend on a bigger tent, I would have chosen a Wenzel though, we outgrew ours, but it has literally lasted for 12 years with not a problem.  I just kind of expected a little more from Coleman, not even old school Coleman standards, but just a little bit more."],["Nothing fancy here... just a big one room tent that can sleep 5 people comfortably.  Coleman calls it an 8 person tent, but that's a tight squeeze."],["Tent is roomy and airy. Took on some water during a long rain - all the corners had puddles and anywhere we touched the tent walls  also brought in water. Also - there was supposed to be a cooler window/floor vent from the description and there is none.  Had a Coleman tent with a pet den for years - poles finally gave out and could not find replacements so had to buy a new tent. Not as happy with this one as the old one."],["This is a great tent. We have 2 small children and had plenty of room for a queen size air mattress and all of our stuff. Love the porch. I would have given it 5 stars except the rainfly/porch is confusing to put on and the instructions were wrong. The second night we were camping a huge storm blew in, wind, lightening and tons of rain all night. We stayed plenty dry. I am very pleased with this tent, but be sure you put it up before going camping since it takes some figuring out. Love the door! Made it so much easier with kids going in and out. (we were camping with kids that were 2, 2, 3, 4 and some older kids) Everyone else called this the Taj Mahal. LOL."],["Really nice tent when it was up. I love the little  \"porch\" and the size was great for 5 people. Two queen air mattresses went side to side and barely touched the sides of the tent. We might have to squeeze in when it rains so they don't touch the sides and let the wetness in. The rainfly was a little confusing the first time with all of the poles and tie downs, and the poles for the door but it's ok. The door is very nice! Like I said, it's very nice once it is up."],["This is a nice basic dome tent, seems like the perfect amount of room for car camping with my husband and two 5 yos.  I am 5'2 and was able to put this tent up with a little bit of help from my 5 yo.  The fabric sleeves that the poles go through seem a little thin, which is why I give this 4 stars.  We'll see how it holds up over time.  We decided to purchase this tent, over other more expensive tents, for the hinged door, which I am already SO HAPPY with.  The tent went up in the yard for waterproofing and my kids were in and out of that tent over and over again.  No zippers to worry about with the door.The tent has a lot of mesh on the sides and towards the front, however it is covered by the rain fly.  There is a zippered window in the back.  It has a bathtub floor and a little plastic loop in the ceiling to hold a light.  Two mesh bags, one on each side inside to hold your cell phone, etc...  And a port for running electric cables through.  It also comes with a grey rectangle the same fabric as the floor that you can stake down in front of the door for a doormat.Overall, this looks like it will be a great starter tent for my young family.  The price is right and if it lasts through the next few summers with my rough kids, I will be happy. And then after they are older and more conscientious, I may upgrade to a pricier tent.7/19/2011: After sealing the seams and letting them dry for 24+ hours, we left this tent up in our backyard overnight during thunderstorms.  The areas where the seams were not sealed on the rainfly because we could not reach, leaked.  There were little puddles around the edges of the tent.  So make sure you seal the seams if you buy this tent.  we are going to finish the sealing and hope that fixes the problem.7/25/2011:  Back from our camping trip, this tent was great!!!  I am so happy with my purchase.  We sealed ALL the seams this time and also properly staked the rainfly which I realized I did not do the last time.  We woke up at 7am during our camping trip to torrential downpours that lasted three hours and then sprinkled the rest of the day.  We stayed completely dry, were able to leave the back window and window in the door wide open during the storm, the back and front awning did a great job of keeping the rain out.  Great ventilation for those hot summer nights.  Also, loved the hinged door.  This is a great tent for a family with young kids.  However, 8 person is a stretch.  We had one full sized air mattress in the center and a thermarest on either side for the kids.  The rest of the space was taken up with our small bags, one for each of us.  So for us, this was a perfect size for the four of us plus our stuff.  I'm glad we did not go smaller."],["The evanston 8 is a great tent.I bought three coleman tents for my girl scout troop to use during our recent camping trip. I like the evanston the best. The tent is very spacious and the girls had plenty of room. I had seven girls in this tent with their duffles and there was still plenty of room to move around. The girls really enjoyed having the extra room, not to mention they could all fully stand up and walk around in it, and so could I. The set-up was very easy, I had the girls test putting it together a week before our camping trip. They were able to get the tent up in twenty mintues, since then we've put the tent up two more times and can be done in 10 mintues. Even the time I put it up on my own, it took less than 20 mintues. It's super easy. It did rain on our camping trip and girls all stayed dry. Only a drop or two in the one corner of the tent, and i'm sure if i had use seam sealer then that could have been prevented...but the drop was the size of 2 quarters. There were other scouts in tents around us and there bedding was completly soaked for most of the girls. I came home from the camping trip and put the tent up again to air it out. I also bought the evanston 4 for this camping trip and there was not even a drop of water in the tent...it stayed nice and dry.The other thing I liked was the hinge door. The girl were able to keep it closed without fussing back and forth with the zipper. In past tents...they would open and close constantly messing with the zipper."],["It is very roomy:  big enough for our two oversized cots.  The hinged door with the velcro is very nice and keeps you from having to constantly zip the door closed.  The color coded poles make it easy to set up.  We used it in Big Bend where the winds got close to 30 mph at night and it stayed intact other than a couple of the back fly tie downs got loose and that was probably because the ground was very rocky in that area.  The temperatures got into the twenties at night but the tent stayed pretty warm.My only complaint is the way the fly attaches at the front to the tent poles and the \"porch\" poles is confusing."],["We bought this tent from the Coleman Youth Group website for a lot less than other sites. It's a typical mid quality tent. We've used it a couple of times, for Boy Scout camp outs. We bought it, thinking we wanted a larger tent. We didn't quite visualize how large a 12'x12' tent was going to be. It's difficult to find a space large enough to erect it, in a lot of campgrounds. It takes 30 minutes plus and at least 2 people to set up. Last time we had the help of 2 friends for a total of 4. It's a monster, and weighs a ton, when packed. After the first trip we lost one of the ferrules at the end of a main pole (due to cheap glue used by the manufacturer). Ferrules are the metal tips that go into the ring and pin assemblies at the corners. Without them you can't erect the tent. Well, on our second trip we were at a Boy Scout camp in Dallas at about 8PM, when we discovered the missing part. Great! what to do? After some quick thinking we discovered that my wife's single cell mag-lite, when disassembled with both ends removed. Was able to fit securely on what I estimate to be 9 or 11 mm fiberglass main poles. It worked so well I have left it on, instead of buying a new, real ferrule. Bought my wife a new flashlight though. We seam sealed everything before the first trip, so no leaks. (main cause of leaks on low-mid quality tents, where manufacturer doesn't do it at the factory) Rain fly is typical corner cutting cheap out compromise. It's OK. Held up to wind fairly well. Has guy out points, and poles that go in to the door, so that it acts like a screen door in your home. If I were going for another large tent, i.e.; bigger than 10'x10'. I'd get a long and narrow one for easier set up. 12' square is just too big to reach across during assembly. We're currently waiting on an ALPS Taurus Outfitter 5 to arrive. After using an ALPS Taurus 4 with Scouts. They cost a bit more(but not as much as high end brands), but have metal poles and clip assembly, instead of sleeves. They also have a full coverage fly. Basically all the features of high end tents at little more than Coleman. If I was buying another mid priced tent, I would consider Coleman again, as well as Wentzel. I have been hearing about quality issues with newer Eurekas, so I don't know if their higher prices are justified anymore."],["This tent was a recent purchase intended to be used for family car camping trips for this summer.  Over Memorial Day weekend I set the tent up for the first time in the backyard so the kids could check it out and I could get a feel for the size of it and waterproof it prior to taking camping.I felt I had to chime in on this as this tent has exceeded my expectations so far.First of all, the tent is a perfect size for a family of 4 (2 adults, 2 kids).  It could be the perfect tent for a larger group as long as you don't mind feeling \"cozy\".  I like the 12x12 footprint of the tent  & was one of the initial reasons for going with this one along with other features it had.  The square footprint allows it to feel roomy and again, reviewing it as a family of 4, there was more than enough room for all 4 of us with plenty of room to spread out and for all of the gear we brought out to the tent from the house.  We inflated a queen sized mattress for the kids and that took up half the width of the tent with space at the top and bottom of the mattress for coolers, books, toys, shoes and all kinds of other stuff.  On the other half there was more than enough room for me and my wife to move around comfortably without feeling confined.  It felt like a shared bedroom in size.  If you were to fit 6-8 people in it with just sleeping bags, there is certainly enough room, but I'm sure it wouldn't feel as spacious.  The tent is rather large and could possibly be setup by only 1 person, but the rods are long and it was easy enough to setup by me and a 4 year old, so you don't need 2 grownups to set it up.Other things that I liked is that the shade of green more closely resembles the manufacturer's picture of the kids coming out of the tent as I didn't think I was going to like the other shade in similar pictures as much.  In person, it's a nice looking tent with the color and the shape, both with and without the rain-fly vestibule.  There are 2 pockets inside along the sides about halfway up the tent but they are not in the way at all, and are plenty big enough to hold flashlights, keys, mp3 players, phones, and things like that.  Their not huge but big enough for those types of devices.  The back flap is nice if you wanted to keep a cooler out of the tent but still have access to it, although, we had so much room we just kept the cooler in the tent, so it was just used as an air vent.Another thing that is really nice about the tent is the almost open view with mesh ceiling.  The top of the tent without the rain-fly is almost completely exposed minus the nylon coming up to the top from the back of the tent, so it is really nice being able to see they sky and you get a lot of ventilation between the open ceiling and the front and back window flaps, there is plenty of circulation.  There is a ring type hook in the center of the tent, which we were able to hang a large sized lantern from and it had no problem supporting the weight of it.  In the center of the tent, it is tall enough to allow us to stand up without having to hunch over, but with the lantern hung, you just need to take it down during the day so as not to bump your head into the lantern.The big test came last night though, as the tent has been up since the weekend and I have not yet waterproofed it.  We were under a tornado warning last night and had severe winds, rains, thunder and lightning.  I went out to the tent this morning to find out how bad the damage was and the tent was standing there strong as ever.  When I unzipped the door, which is also another nice feature especially with the kids going in and out all the time; since it is a hinged door, it is easy to get in and out of, I expected to find a ton of water inside the tent but was pleasantly surprised to find not one drop of water in the tent whatsoever, which is why I felt the need to chime in with my opinions on this tent.  There are some less expensive tents available, but having done quite a bit of research on them prior to buying this one and after seeing it setup and in action, I believe this may be the perfect family tent."],["My tent came and boy was it heavy. Much heavier than any other tent I've had before. Later realized, it was the poles that we're causing all the weight. Set my tent up in the basement. Didn't have any problems setting it up but I definitly needed another hand. I didn't put the rainfly on because I didn't have enough room to move around.Went camping this past weekend. The day I set up, it was really windy. So I needed a little help with holding it together. The rainfly was a pain in the butt to figure out. Mainly because it was so large and the wind didn't help. Finally managed to get everything staked down with the help my brother and his super boy scout skills.Now I didn't get to test out how durable it was in the rain. But that time will come.Overall, I thought this tent was great. Enough room for mattresses, everything. Which after a couple of years of staying in a tent where the queen mattress takes up the whole area, this is heaven. I love tents where you can stand up and not have to lay down on the floor to put on pants. I'm sure you all know what I mean. I love the door. The zippers were a little small and have a feeling they may break after a while, but you can always fix a zipper.Very pleased, so far. I'll write another review once I take it camping in the rain."],["Went camping and tent was nice size.  Swing door was super convenient.  Only issue was tent did NOT have vent in the back like the picture showed or was in the description.  What is Amazon's policy on this?"],["After taking this tent on a few family camping trips, I would say that it does the job well and is very roomy.  However that roominess can backfire if the campsite is not very large.  None of the campsites we have been to so far have enough flat room to fit the whole tent, which is not a huge deal since you don't usually need the whole 12 feet anyways.  The description says that there is an airhole is the bottom back of the tent.  Ours did not have one."],["I am 71 and my wife is 67 - we are avid tent campers and do like to have a lot of room to stretch out.  We went from a 12 x 10 coleman to this 12 x 12 evanston 8.  We love the additional room in this tent.  Additionally the door is a fantastic plus.  The ease to get in and out, especially during the night, adds to the camping experience.  Kudos to Coleman for this feature.Haven't camped in the rain yet but the first thing we do with all tents is to seam seal them.  So we are not expecting any problems as we have never had them with our previous Coleman tents after seam sealing and believe me we have been through some nasty, nasty weather.Although that little air vent shown in the back of the tent is not included on the tent (whats up with that Coleman?) air circulation doesn't appear to be a problem with the front and rear windows open.  In really warm weather we take a fan and in the really cold weather we take a small electric heater.  Cold weather camping is the most fun.So overall folks take it from these two seniors, if you buy this Coleman Evanston, you will not be sorry."],["This is a Great Tent. Camped in it for a week through some pretty hard rains and stayed dry. The tent is large enough inside for a queen size cot and chair with extra space for bags. The door is the big plus, it works GREAT, Just pull it open and shut it, it fastens itself with velcro. The only time you have to fool with a zipper is when you may want to to secure it for the night. This tent is easy enough for one person to set up if you know what your doing, if not, then two people would be better as it is a large tent. All in All,,, this tent is made really well and i would recomend it to anyone who would ask."],["Not quite a 3 season tent. Maybe a 2 1/2 season at the most. With the entire ceiling made up of the mesh any heat generated in the tent through the day escapes even with the rain fly on.  Tent was first used in Florida and set up in the somewhat dark infield of Daytona Intl Speedway. Couldn't get a dry run in at home for we had snow on the ground and the tent was bigger than the rooms in my house. Despite this, set up went pretty smooth. Could've benefitted from reading the instructions a second or third time at home.  The tent is huge. If the door were larger I swear my Honda Fit would be able to fit inside. The little vestibule/porch area came in handy to shelter us from some strong winds while just relaxing outside. Was able to read with my chair tucked in the &#34;porch&#34; without the wind whipping the magazine pages about. I'm 6'3&#34; and was able to stand up in a good portion of the tent. Looking forward to using it this summer. The President's Day weekend 2013 in Daytona had lows in the low 30's with gale force winds. Without our small heater and electricity (the tent does have a pocket for a plug to come into the tent) we were pretty cold overnight and in the mornings there in Daytona. Even with daytime highs in the 50's I would think twice about using this tent in cold(er) conditions."],["I have camped a lot by myself on motorcycle trips while riding my KLR using a small two man tent. This tent was purchased for my wife and I to use together. Why an 8 person tent for two people? Well I like to be able to move around without stepping on someone.The tent is of average construction. If you are careful and pack it away correctly you can expect this tent to last a few seasons. Will your grand children use this tent 30 years from now? Doubt it but not many thing are made to last these days.My only major complaint so far is with the instructions. They are incorrect in the color of the rainfly pole to be used. This was confusing the first time I put it up.  Also expect it to take a little long that 15 min to put it up. At least the first few times. All in all I'm pleased with the tent. Big_Al"],["Going to a square (12 x 12) floor plan was a big improvement over our previous 10 x 14 Coleman tent.

It could be the tent gods also liked it too and kept the rain away."],["great tent, roomy easy set up/take down, had no problem fitting it back into the bag it came in, have not had a chance to test in the rain but after seam sealing and a coat of silicone water treatment i think it will be just fine."],["This tent offers plenty of space and didn't let a drop of rain in on us even though we had severe thunder storms. The square floorplan, rather than a rectangle that most tents offer worked great because no one woke up with their head or feet against the tent walls. We had two full size air mattresses, a lounge chair, and our cooler & clothes bags all inside and nothing touched the walls which meant nothing got damp. This tent is easy to set up, color coded poles and all, but it takes a while. The rain fly is a little involved and there is a lot of lines to steak out so the tent doesn't go up, or come down, as quickly as I would like. Also the bag it comes in is not quite big enough when you go to put it back in. I gave up and decided to store it in a duffle bag I had. Overall, this tent is roomy, has great ventilation, and is perfectly waterproof. The hinge door is pretty awesome, especially if u have a 5 year old who likes to go in and out a hundred times!

Great tent!"],["I never do Amazon reviews, but I loved this tent so much, I had to share my opinion.  Yes, the tent is large and takes a bit of time to set up at first.  I set it up in my yard to weather test it.  After several hours of heavy rain off and on, I checked the tent and there wasn't a single drop of water inside... not one!  I didn't do any extra sealing of the seams or anything like some of the other reviewers did.  I know that a tent can leak if the fly sags at all or isn't staked down properly, so I feel like as long as it's staked down properly it shouldn't really be a problem.  The \"front porch\" also remained completely dry underneath.  I suppose if the rain were coming in a different direction that might not be the case, but I am very pleased with this tent.  Don't underestimate the size of this tent.  12x12 is big!  The hinged door seemed a bit unnecessary at first, but after going in and out of it a few times, I guess it is kind of a nice addition =)"],["The tent is just wonderful, easy to put up and take down, handles the wind very well, and is spacious enough for us and our dog."],["Love this tent!! It's roomy and airy, easy to put up, fits all our gear and I love the hinged door. Haven't tried it in wet weather yet, so cannot comment on the waterproofing. We are a family of 3 and the 6 person tent was more than spacious for us. However, it would be a very tight space if you tried to fit 6 people to sleep in the same space."],["I purchased this tent to replace a 20 year old Coleman Tent. Our first use for the tent was at Yosemite National Park over Labor Day weekend. Set up was easy and the only problem we had was getting the rain fly on correctly (inside out). The tent stakes are under sized and I recommend using larger tent stakes. The door is great. It makes going in and out of the tent effortless. Compared to my old Coleman tent with multiple zippers to open and close, this is a great improvement.The temperature dropped at night down to 35 degrees and the open top screening on the tent allowed more cold air in than I cared for. This is an advantage in hot summer weather but fall and winter is not a good use for this tent if it is cold and windy. Even with the rain fly in place you notice the cold air blowing in.I am keeping my 20 year Coleman for fall camping as it completely seals up. However for the late spring thru summer season when we do most of our camping this tent is fine.Size is good for two people with a dog and cots. I do not see getting 4 people in with cots. Maybe OK with air mattresses. Like all tents the number of people it holds is usually overstated."],["The Background: We go car camping 2 times a year on the shore of Lake Michigan, once in April and once in November. We experience temperatures ranging from 20 degrees F to 70 degrees F, winds up to 55mph, torrential rains, and even snow. In the last 5 years, we've gone through 7 big (large) name brand tents (including coleman). They have all had their issues. Some rain leakage, some rips, and lately shattered poles and tent collapses due to high winds. It's just 2 of us with our golden retriever, however we like the extra space in the family &#34;lodge&#34; tents and we both prefer to use two queen air mattresses. We also like to have room to stand up without issue (I'm 6ft) to change clothes and let the dog out, move around, etc. Some of the issues with our huge tents are:1) Box-shaped, not dome shaped...which leaves broad sides of the tent prone to massive billowing which stresses the poles (shattering) and beats us in the face at night2) Excessive setup times / difficulty3) Too much mesh and open space in the winter (drafty/warmth)The Goal: So, we set out to find the closest thing to a &#34;4 season&#34; tent that we could find that would be considerably more aerodynamic, stable,  smaller than what we're used to but large enough to still fit our 2 queens with our dog and still be able to walk around, etc as was mentioned above. We scoured the internet and checked out local big box stores for weeks before our camping trip. We finally decided on this tent, primarily due to the 12x12 footprint and the dome-based structure. We also were optimistic about the 3/4 rainfly for our heavy rains, but we did have a concern about the wings on the front essentially becoming a wind sail in our heavy winds.The Result: We were able to use this tent (non-screenroom version) for the first time this past weekend. We had an non-typical 70 degree sunny Michigan weather weekend complete with 5-10mph low winds, and no rain. The initial setup took around 45-60min, although everything but the fly was setup in the first 20min. It will go much quicker next time. The directions weren't completely clear 100% of the time but it was attainable with some executive decision making. As we set it up, I was concerned with the amount of give the main poles had in them but pushed on. The fly was somewhat difficult but once we got it affixed to a pole or two, things went a little better. Once everything was staked down (with our own heavy duty stakes) including the wings in the front, that sucker wasn't moving. Both nights, it got down to 40 degrees F and it didn't really retain any heat, but it also wasn't anywhere near as drafty as our previous tents. We didn't have any rain or high winds so I can't say much about that yet but things worked out perfectly. We even used the little floor mat which could be staked down. I also came to appreciate the awning for a bit of shade from the intense sun. I wish the utility pockets were at the back side of the tent (where peoples heads usually are) instead of the front, but no big deal. We loved the high amount of privacy this tent offered and the limited amount of mesh was nice for our purpose. I loved the reinforced window on the back and the hood of the front of the tent (fiberglass poles). The door was also hinged and was a nice addition. We did put down a 12x12 tarp underneath which did get wet as it was slightly rainy when we set it up, no leaking issues or wet floor problems. The best of it though was the internal space for the size of the footprint. This was the perfect combo to have a large footprint but still keep the aerodynamics, stability, and the ability to walk around a bit and have plenty of storage room. I should also note that I did NOT seam seal this tent.Pros: Size, cost, stability, aerodynamics, quality of the tent (including sewing and poles)Cons: The fly could be slightly less awkward, the directions could have been slightly more clear, and the mesh utility pockets should have been located at the back of the tent, but none of these are dealbreakers. (The weight didn't both me as we're car campers, but it would probably be too heavy for non-car campers.I'll update this again in November 2014 when we go again and will likely be exposed to winds/rain/snow etc which of course is when it will receive the real test."]],"title":"Coleman Evanston 8 Person Tent","total_reviews":56,"sentiment":0.7586482143,"label":"positive","best_review":["Used this tent on  recent camping trip.

I was wrong. They were NOT made in America. I was extremely annoyed by this fact but I bought them as a gift for my son's teacher as a farewell token at the end of the school year and he loves the Spartans so I had no time to return them and get something else.I only gave these mugs 2 stars for the reason that the lid on the travel mug seemed somewhat cheap and it looked as though it may be leaky. I wasn't impressed with the lid at all. The handle felt somewhat sub-standard as well and it seemed very small. I bought these for a man and I think he may have a problem having a decent grip on the handle, only being able to get 3 fingers through the opening. It's more suited to small hands. The black ceramic mug looked very nice, was a nice weight, and a decent size. I wasn't crazy about the hand wash only, but that was my fault.

My first order of these Rico wallets was one in MLB (Atlanta Braves) and another in NFL (Seattle Seahawks) for the guys on my Christmas list. I was so impressed with the quality of the wallets that I came back to Amazon and purchased another Florida Gator wallet.The leather of these wallets are so soft and buttery with a precise embossing of the team chosen and ordered. The problem with this Florida Gator wallet is that the picture showing a gator head and the word \"Gators\" underneath is the wrong picture. Anyone ordering this particular design will not get what is shown, but a wallet with just the gator head (with no wording) embossed onto the front of the wallet. I've tried reordering the wallet only to receive the same gator head wallet with no wording embossed on it again. For this reason, I have removed one star from my rating.I initially was able to keep the first wallet I ordered and was sent by Amazon, as I had two nephews to buy different Florida Gator wallets for. However, I did not want them to receive the same wallet. So I kept the first wallet with just the gator head and sent back the second gator head wallet. It's disappointing when you find what you think is the perfect gift only to receive the item looking not like what is shown and you were expecting. I had to choose a totally different wallet for a second nephew.Don't get me wrong, if you-the buyer, do not mind not having the \"Gators\" wording on the wallet, these are quality genuine leather wallets. Besides the soft, buttery feel to the leather, when you open the tri-fold wallet open it has slots for credit cards on both ends of the inside of the tri-fold that open up the wallet. The mid-section has a place with a plastic covering to hold one's Driver's License or photo ID and on top of it is a plastic section that holds pictures. When you open the wallet fully, the paper money section has a divider in it, making two seconds to separate one's money or possibly keeping one's receipts in one section and their paper money in the other section.For the quality of the wallet, the price is great. As it appears to be a wallet not only of quality but one that looks to be durable. It does make a terrific Christmas gift. I'm just sorry I couldn't get this wallet in the embossing shown in the picture to not duplicate and of the 4 wallets I will be gifting this year.From what I've searched around, I do not believe that the wallet with the gator head and the wording of \"Gators\" is available anymore. This could be an older picture that makes the item need a current picture of.The gator head embossing on its own, is attractive and very well done."],["Purchased this as a Christmas gift.

I replaced the chain myself, and dialed in the derailleurs and have not missed a shift yet.  Crisp, fast, confident shifts.One aspect of the reviews here and at other sites that was a bit confusing was trying to decipher compatibility with my 105 components.

AND they came with shoe clips which cost $15 seperately. Easy to install. All around great."],["I bought this from Amazon, having never purchased cycling gear from Amazon before, because Amazon had by far the best price on the product.  The pedal is exactly as I expected based on reviews, for better and for worse.  I'll go over the pros and cons.Pros:(1)  Very inexpensive for the functionality you're getting - flat pedal for commuting or casual rides, SPD pedal for longer rides.(2)  Relatively light weight (380g on my scale), much lighter than most mountain bike-specific SPD pedals, which until recently were your only choice for a dual-sided pedal (for example, theShimano PD-M324 Clipless/Clip Pedals).(3)  The pedals look very sleek.(4)  The bearings are much better than the inexpensive pedals I had been using before on my commuter.  The \"spinup\", for lack of a better term, requires much less effort.  This may be both a combination of weight (these are much lighter than many metal platform pedals), as well as the bearings.Cons:(1)  The platform side is quite slick, as others have mentioned.  I bought the pedals despite knowing this because my prior pedals, which were studded, were ruining the soles on my work shoes.  These pedals will not damage shoes, but at the same time, offer little grip.  That's not such a problem with sneakers that have grippy soles, but with flat-soled shoes, you really have to be careful about how much pressure you put on the pedal and can't easily stand up while pedaling.  In addition to the slickness of the platform, the size of the platform also contributes, as it is much narrower than a standard flat pedal, so if you're not careful, your foot can slip off the edge, not just the front or back.  This is a trade-off for a sleek-looking, functional SPD pedal.(2)  The clip-in side ships at a default tension that is far too tight, even for experienced riders.  Anyone new to riding an SPD-style pedal should immediately adjust the tension to the opposite extreme to get a feel for using them.  At default tension, they are uncomfortably hard to get out of (and I have 15 years of experience on Shimano's SPD pedals, dating back to the M535, released in 1995).(3)  I purchased the black pedals because they matched my black bike better, but as expected, the paint on the platform chips off easily.  This is especially true when using it with SPD cleats, which can tear up the paint very quickly if you're using the platform side momentarily while riding.Overall, I'm very satisfied with the pedals.  They offer a lot of performance for the price.  Just be aware of the slickness of the platform if you intend to ride with dress shoes, the problem with the default tension, and the issue with the black paint chipping."],["After many years of not riding, I found myself struggling with pedals that had clips on both sides. After a few incidents where I lost my balance while being clipped in, I opted to install the Shimano PD-A530. What I like about these pedals is that if I want to use my trainer I can clip in with the one side and if I just want to go for a casual ride I can use whatever shoe I am wearing. The one downside I will have to say is that there is not a lot of traction on flip side of this pedal if using a regular shoe. If you are wearing cleated shoes though I like that you can use either side and still feel secure."],["This is my first time as far as siding with cleats. I must say the improvement is remarkable. I reckon at least a 10% improvement in pedaling effectiveness. However the uncertainty of clipping in is greatly reduced by having the option to go without clipping in when in doubt. In this sense this pedal is great. Very smooth and light."],["A great pedal that works attached or not.The clipped side works as it's supposed to. Easy to clip in and clip out as you set the spring's tension.The non-cliped side is big enough to make it confortable and not slippery.I like it because I can use it clipped during my regular rides and the non-clipped side when I ride with my 1 year old daughter.Highly recommend."],["Pedal is great for the commuter cyclist and for those that misplace cycle shoes frequently.  Easy to install and nice and light."],["My wife got these for me as an anniversary present and I love them. I have a pretty short daily commute (6 miles round trip), but I have noticed a big difference, especially going up hills. I also like that I don't have to put on my bike shoes for a trip down the block.The pedals are paired with a set of Shimano SH-M077 mountain bike shoes and SH-56 cleats. For beginners, I recommend getting the SH-56 cleats instead of the included SH-51 cleats, as they are much easier to release from. Just today, I almost fell at a stop light, but was able to yank my foot out just in time.Clipping in does take some getting used to, as you have to  flip the pedal to the correct side first. With practice, you should be able to do it by feel.If these are your first set of replacement pedals, I recommend getting a pedal wrench. It will make your life much easier, and should not be more than ten dollars or so.Overall, the build quality seems very solid and they feel like they can take a beating."],["My daily commute is less than 20 miles, I don't race yet..Newb to clipless pedals and Cycling shoes.I have pair this pedal with the Shimano SH-RT82 which works perfectly.nothing else to compare to these seem to work great, curious to see whats different to cycling clipless and regular shoe.so far, it seem average speed picked up a little, and time faster by 10 minute on my 15 mile commute.but their are so many factors to those numbers right now, traffic, road condition, and wind.Reasons why i picked these pedals are theyI can be used with recessed shoes, i have read where the other racing type pedal reqiures shoes that are harder to walk in, I do get off my bike quite often to take pictures or maybe shop for grocery.Since i am not road bike racing i don't need light weight pedals these do fine.It has a dual platform, i have not tested the other side yet so no comment currently but great for when i don't want clipless pedals i guess.If your distance isn't 100 mile or more, want to be able to walk off bike, weight is not a issue, SPD Pedal A530 is something you should consider.UPDATE 6/8/2013Still getting use to clipping in on my bike. Have about 250 mile on these pedals now. Working great. Tested the other side that don't require clipping in. Seems kinda slippery ok for short distance."],["I bought these a while back for my tandem with spontaneous riding in mind. If the wife and I decide to go for a short spin around the neighborhood, we don't have to change shoes to do it. These pedals give us that luxury. If we're going on a long ride, we'll definitely go for cycling shoes.The downside is the loss of double-side pedals for starts - starts are more coordinated/planned on a tandem than on a half-bike. But I knew that going in, so being able to ride in sneakers makes it worth a little inconvenience.I'm very happy with the purchase."],["These dual purpose pedals are priced just right for the function they perform. Very smooth clipping action. Lightest set that I could find which have dual use."],["These pedals are great! They clip in and release with ease. Best part, you can ride with regular shoes for those quick trips or if you have forgotten your riding shoes.

They are a great for newbies. I'm fully SPD now."],["Overall, I'm pretty happy with these pedals - they feel solid and are weighted so that the clip side flips up, which is how I use them most often. I have to agree with others who have said that the platform side is a bit slick.

If the wrong side of a pedal faces up when you try to clip in or not, just spin the crank half way around and the right side faces up, or simply spin the pedal half way around with your foot like you always have to do with toeclipped pedals.Amazon, as usual, provided exemplary service and a great product at a good price."],["This is my first pair of SPD pedals.

Fell a couple more times when stopping on the trail even after finally loosening them all the way!!! Maybe 1 out of 4 times they would not release after being fully loosened. That is when I realized the cleat/peddle surfaces needed to be polished by repeated cycling of the cleats in/out for them to release consistently. Also, check the release at the 9 o'clock position (foot rearward and halfway up), that is the hardest position to release from-for me and will tell you if they are loose enough. Also, they do not float in the cleat up position at least for now, the bearings are still tight though smooth.Even on the loosest setting I could not pull the shoe straight up and out of the peddles, so do not worry about loosening them too much."],["Bought these for my wife's Trek 1.2.

We found out that mountain bike shoes with the cleat recessed deep on the bottom of the shoe can't clip in.

So they're not very light, but not exactly bricks.The platform side of the A530 allows you to wear regular sneakers/shoes to bike, although they are rather comfortable due to the longer length/narrower width, the surface is slippery. I found myself losing a lot of power while biking trying to keep my feet on the pedals. The narrower width gives you a bit more ground clearance while leaned and pedaling.The SPD-side of the pedals allows the use of SPD cleats. I found the tension to be acceptable right out of the box. The tension screw is adjusted using a 3mm hex wrench. With the SH56 multi-release cleats, I am able to easily release the cleats at various angles but without ever accidentally releasing during hard pedaling. There is also a great deal of float.The spindles are Chrome-moly and you can use either a 15mm open ended wrench to tighten them, or a 8mm hex socket on the back end. I used the 8mm hex socket and a torque wrench to torque them.These pedals come with the SH51 cleats that only release with an outward swing motion of the heel. The SH56's are optional and purchased separately. The A530 does not come with cleat nuts.These pedals do not drop down by weight/gravity automatically, so I found myself flipping the pedal while pedaling on the road in case I had to unclip/re-clip. I think once the bearings loosen up or wear in, they may droop down automatically.I noticed some grease leakage from the left pedal spindle seal. Doing an Internet search showed this to be somewhat common. This particular spindle seemed kind of loose because the pedal spins easier than the other (which isn't leaking grease).Overall: 4/5 stars, could be lighter with better bite on the platform face of the pedals"],["I decided to purchase the Shimano PD-A530 pedals after considering other SPD models both from Shimano and its competitors.

This Shimano model is just about perfect for my requirements.  After more than 300 miles on the saddle, I could say with confidence that this is a solid performer.  I have no problems with my pedal strokes, am able to climb stronger, my knees don't hurt and always gives that reassuring click sound letting me know that I've successfully clipped my feet.  The only issue that still lingers is that even after 5 weeks and more than 2 dozen rides, it still takes me a little bit more of an effort to un-clip my feet despite dialing in the lowest cleat tension allowed by the pedal.  At first it can be a bit nerve-wracking as I scrambled to break my feet loose or else suffer a nasty spill, but I've learned to polish my anticipation skills even further as to when to un-clip and which foot first.This is highly recommended for avid cyclists who are not yet into the other serious clip types, are on a budget, and simply want to use their bike for a leisurely ride in between their more serious stuff."],["I use these on my road bike.

The platform side does not grip shoes too well, but good enough. I'll drill and tap them to add a few studs but it's really not necessary. They also are reasonably light for this type of peddle. Others have asked so i'll add that the seals provide enough resistance that the peddle will stay where you leave it - meaning if you are using the platform side and take your foot off of it, it will stay in that position and not rotate by itself."],["Great pedal easy to adjust, I think I'm using the second or third to easiest unclip tension.

Being both new to this way of riding as well as a commuter in a downtown city, I wanted the ability to clip-in for longer rides while still being able to ride without clip-in shoes for shorter rides. These pedals have been perfect for both of these uses.I did not install these on my own, so I cannot speak to the installation process. I had to take my bike in for other maintenance and had them do this at the same time."],["Having already had their M-324 cage pedals on my previous 29er, I knew that Shimano pedals were good and reliable (I&#8217;d never had any problems with the M-324&#8242;s) so I stayed with the brand but I wanted to try the PD-A530 platform pedals, which uses the same SPD cleats as my M-324&#8242;s (making my shoe cleats 100% compatible). I liked the wider platform compared to my M-324&#8242;s, and like other SPD pedals, the cleat tension is easily adjustable with the turn of an Allen wrench. You could dial down the tension if it&#8217;s your first time with clipless pedals, then tighten it up slowly until it&#8217;s at a level you&#8217;re comfortable with. They&#8217;re pretty tough too, so don't worry about bashing them onto rocks and tree stumps - they can handle a beating.I did notice that the weight of the platform side of the pedal will make it always settle clip-up, meaning whenever you start to ride it&#8217;s in position for your cleats; however, if you want to utilize the platform side you&#8217;ll have to make it a point to flip the pedal over first. This will affect those who buy the pedal with the primary intention of using the platform side, but I thought I&#8217;d mention it. Also, the platform side doesn&#8217;t have as much grip compared to pin-type pedals. If you&#8217;re wearing shoes with the SPD cleats on, your shoes won&#8217;t grab the platform as well as if you were using softer, flatter-bottomed shoes.Overall, the Shimano PD-A530&#8242;s are a good choice to start with if you aren&#8217;t sure if you want to go platform or clipless. The ability to adjust the clip tension is great for beginners, and while you decide between clipless or platform, the cost of these pedals are wallet-friendly. Not to mention that these, like other Shimano pedals, are excellent quality items."],["I'm working my way up to getting more and more serious about mountain biking. But one of the hardest problems I struggle with is when I have to clip-in and start immediately pedalling up-hill. Having the platform side helps for those moments, or moments where I only need to pedal a short distance before dismounting again.Also, I bought a fat-bike and everyone wants to ride it (including my son). That was part of the draw to this pedal; Allowing others to ride it regardless of their shoe. To that end, again, it works great.Now why I docked a star:* when clipped in, the platform side hangs pretty low. I occasionally snag it on roots, curbs, etc. Just something to keep in mind. Maybe not a knock of a full start on its own. But...* The ridges on the platform side are almost useless. I would prefer a little more teeth action on the platform side. If I put any serious weight on to it to get going (per se, up-hill in dirt/sand/etc), I feel like my foot will slide off.Technically the Shimano M324 SPD solves this - so if the teeth will be an issue, go that route. However the penalty will be weight. Why they didn't make a best-of-both-worlds, I don't know.Overall, I like the pedal. But as I get better, I think I may switch to a non-hybrid like the Shimano SPD original line, or Eggbeaters."],["One thing that isn't mentioned often times is these pedals COME with cleats for your shoes.If I had known that I would have save $25.Overall, great pedal.

As recommended in at least one other review, I adjusted the tension to the lightest point and it is fine - easy to get in and out, and my shoes are firmly attached when riding.  I've also had a couple of opportunities to ride with running shoes using the non-clip side and have no complaints there either.  You would definitely want to have rubber-soled shoes to use on the non-clip side as the pedals do not provide much friction."],["I have had them on my bike for the past month and the work great, I love the fact that I can use them without my biking shoes so I can ride with my kids on the street."],["So I've been riding shimano clipless pedals for about 6 months without bike shoes.... So what I have to say about how wonderful these things are may be slightly biased. I think I'm a pretty fair reviewer, but it's just something for people to keep in mind as they read this.Because I primarily use my bike for commuting I do not wear bike shoes (nor do I own a pair of bike shoes) most of the time that I'm riding. I just got these guys put on my bike yesterday and took them out for about 13 miles and I have to say that they performed wonderfully. First of all, they provide a nice stable base for you to stand on while you're pedaling. I had no trouble standing up while climbing some decently steep hills which was nice. I did not experience any kind of slippage that some of the other reviews described. I think that the design of the pedals actually forms a nice kind of cup shape for the soles of your feet and it is very comfortable and feels very solid (but again, compared to riding clipless in regular shoes, of course it would feel much stabler) There is a minor annoyance however in that because neither side of the pedal is really heavier than the other, it does not provide the convenience of having either the platform side or clipless side always facing up. This makes getting going a little annoying sometimes when you're trying to get going and flip the pedals over as you're biking so you're on the desired side. This is, however, a minor annoyance. Overall I really like these pedals, they were worth every penny. The bike mechanic I had putting these on for me also told me that he uses these pedals on his touring bike and they're great for riding in sandals and such.One other thing to be aware of is a cosmetic thing (if you're into that) But my bike is black, and so I got the bike pedals. But the crank arms on my bike are silver, so it does look a little odd. I don't particularly mind and I don't know if I think I would like it better if I got the silver ones. It's not really important, just something to keep in mind. They function perfectly though so that's the important part."],["Finally found an affordable pair of dual platform pedals that function well and feel good!

The cleats included are one-directional not multi, so I've had to remember a few times only moving my heel outward will work, but again that's an easy fix if necessary.  Ultimately, tweaking components so they work just right is part of the fun and there's not much to do here.I will say I haven't had any trouble with the platform side being too slick like some reviews.  Maybe I'm just in older shoes, but I've found the platforms to have decent grip when I'm not clipped in and just cruising around.  For a great price I've ended up with my favorite pedals in nearly 10 years of everyday bike commuting."],["They are the best of the Dual sided peddles I have seen. they are the lightest at less than 364 grams.

The clip side is great - I've been riding clipless for many years so there was no learning curve for me.  I loosened them about 3 turns per side and it felt very solid, but not totally locked in, in case of emergency bail out.  Did a 50-mile ride up some canyons in Northern Utah where I had to do a lot of pulling with my hamstrings and got a lot of power with these.  I only use the clip side when I do epic rides and use the platform to get to work, farmer's market, movies, etc.  Very convenient.  Also, they're actually lighter than my 8-year-old non-platform SPDs on my Specialized Epic mountain bike - guess the materials have gotten lighter because these are obviously way bigger.

I adjusted mine to the lowest tension setting, based on a review i read here, and it was spot on.  Give them a week or two to loosen up, and you will be very pleased.

They remain facing the same orientation relative to the crank until you push on them--they do however rotate easily and with no noticeable resistance when cycling. Of course, if you were looking for completely frictionless pedals, you probably don't want hybrid pedals anyway since they are heavier. The platform side is a little slick, but works fine if you wear sneakers. The platform side is almost unusable wearing cycling shoes though.I commute to school about six miles one way on a greenway. It gets pretty treacherous sometimes, since it's almost entirely wooded (all sorts of debris on the curvy, hilly path, especially after a storm), so I just wear sneakers and use the platform side with no problem. On the road trips to the gym or on weekend stints, I'm slowly training my brain to get used to the SPD side while wearing cycling shoes and the cleats that came with the pedals.

The clip/cleat works as well as any Shimano pedal.  Nothing new to report.  I chose these for my second bike as a less expensive option.  I use Time Attack Z mountain bike pedals on my other bike  and I have to admit in city traffic the Shimano ia a better choice.  You can adjust the spring tension easily so you can change the ease at which you release from the pedal.  Its a good entry level pedal in this regard. They are super easy to get out of and when in traffic you use the platform side and the cleat does not get in the way, if you are wearing your riding shoes.The down side of this pedal is the platform side. On standard platform pedals or MTB pedals with the set screws a pair of soccer sneaks or flat bottom shoes works well.  Not on this pedal. It is slippery, running sneakers have the best grip.  If Shimano could add the set screw grip or some better teeth to the pedal this would be perfect.  There is the other option I think the 324 dual function pedal but I like this because it has a wider foot bed like a Mountain bike pedal.

Its a great city pedal and gives you options."],["I bought a pair of these in the late fall and didn't have a chance to put many miles on them.  This spring I noticed a once per revolution click when I put my weight on to the right pedal.  Its been getting louder and more consistent as I ride more.  Now its happening every time and its bugging me.  One of the things I like about riding is the lack of mechanical noise.When I replaced the right pedal with my old one, the click is gone so I know its in the pedal.I like the concept, like the pedals, but don't like the noise.  Its past the return period so I'm either going to take it apart to see if it is easily repairable or buy a new pair.EDIT:  I took the offending pedal off the bike and pulled out the Axle Assembly (there are Youtube videos that show how to do this).  I loosened the lock nut, and adjusted the bearings so they were tight but still turned easily.  Retightened the lock nut and re-assembled the Axle Assembly into the pedal.  The noise is gone.  It must have been an assembly problem with mis-adjusted bearings.I would have given these pedals 4 stars for function if they were problem free.  I originally gave these pedals 2 stars for quality but I've raised my original rating to 3 because this quality problem was easily fixable (with some mechanical ability and the right tools).EDIT AGAIN:  The noise came back after 30 miles (the previous edit was after 10).

Mechanism does not clog up with dirt and functions well even after hours of trail riding (Possibly due to the slick coating)7. Look great8.

After using them, I was surprised by just how much they increase pedaling efficiency.  It's surprising how much I can relax my upper legs when I don't have to concentrate on keeping my feet from slipping off the pedals.  Being able to pull up during the pedal stroke also adds a significant amount of extra power when needed.- The dual platform lets me use regular shoes--or simply not clip in when wearing clipless shoes.  It's also nice to have the platform side to get the bike up to speed (or out of a difficult spot) before clipping in.- Plenty of adjustability.  I have the cages set to a loose setting.  With the SH56 cleats, it's easy to twist out of the cages but it's nearly impossible to unclip from the cages by pulling straight up (i.e., they're working as designed).- Good, sturdy metals.- They don't look as aggressive as some other mountain bike clipless pedals, so they match the styling of hybrid bikes or leisure bikes a bit better.Cons- Because the nubs on the platform side are broad and blunt, they don't offer much traction, and my shoes slip around on them more than I'd prefer.- The black paint scratches off very easily.- The cages are a little more difficult to clip into than I would prefer:  I have to fish around a bit to get the cleat to engage.

So i am a noobie:) I was using crank brothers candy pedals but wanted to have a duel platform because I questioned if I would even go clipless anymore after those falls. After riding 20 miles this morning I can say that I don't question anymore. These pedals clip in very easy. I set my tension all the way down and then turned it 2 clicks to the right and that seems perfect for me. They NEVER came unclipped, even when climbing hill out of the saddle. They clip in a lot easier than my candys and I actually fell like there's something under my feet. Got a great float which is one thing I was concerned about because I had a pair of SPD that everytime I turned to look behind me they would unclip. I went through town on purpose and had to clip in and out a lot and I would say that 80% of the time I just put my left foot down and BAM! the pedal was there with the clip side on top. This is my 3rd different set of pedals and it will be my last. Many have said that these pedals are slick on the platform side and I can't say as I have only used the clipless side. I did ride in my tennis shoes around the block last night trying out my chain after cleaning and lubing it and they done just fine, but then again it was just around the block. Don't know what they would do on a long ride. Weight weenies may not like them but I'll take these pedals over a few less grams of weight any day of the weak.They are not as heavy as some people say they are.

Worth every penny, but because they're so affordable, you're not spending TOO many pennies!The only downsides (if they really are even downsides) is that the pedal is heavier than an SPD clipless alone would be, and the pedal platform is a little \"slippery\", so don't expect to do aggressive riding if you're just wearing normal shoes.

The dual pedal comes in handy when approaching a busy intersection.

Every group ride, I would be the last one to get clipped in, and it was always a worry that I'd be able to clip out.  Then we rode up Teton Pass in Idaho, and I discovered that not only was it a pain, it was dangerous.  It was almost impossible for me to get clipped in on a 10% grade in heavy traffic.  I actually crashed.  That prompted me to find some lightweight pedals that could be pedaled without clipping in if needed.  I ordered these and shoes with the two hole pattern to go with and am SO happy.  Now in group rides, I simply start pedaling with the clips facing up (which I set them to automatically do) and my foot automatically clips in!  If I don't want to clip in I simply flip the pedal over and the shoes grip the pedal great.  The shoes I bought are somewhat less stiff than the road shoes, but not enough to bother me at all, and even when standing up pedaling they are firmly connected to these pedals.  I am enjoying riding so much more and feel SO much safer. Added bonus, with the recessed metal cleat, I can walk around in these shoes much more normally than road shoes with their big plastic protrusions.  Plus the cleats should last much longer."],["Easy to install and to adjust the tension on the clips. I almost always ride clipless but it's nice to have the platform for short rides to the store.

I have a high end custom road bike (Cannondale CAAD 8 frame, campagnolo record components front to back, the whole thing weighs a total of 16.4 lbs). These pedals were the perfect addition to my bike. I love the fact that I can either compete in triathlons while clipping in and wearing my cycling shoes for the bike portion or wear street shoes and take my bike out with my family on a nice Sunday afternoon. These pedals are so versatile that I believe anyone wanting to get into cycling should start with a pair of these.They arent the lightest pedals on the market but the versatility, in my opinion, far out weigh the the little bit of extra weight. The way I see it, if I can stand to lose 15-20 lbs then what is an extra 100-200 grams. The pedals are very easy to install and only takes a total of 5 minutes start to finish. The only tools that you need are an Allen wrench and a regular crescent wrench.The clip side of the pedals are very easy to clip in and out of once you get the hang of it. The pedals accept the spd style cleats (which are supplied with these pedals). The pedals are adjustable in the amount of tension that you can add to the clips. As I said before they are very adjustable and very versatile. These pedals are a good addition to either a mountain bike or road bikes. I'm going to get a new mountain bike soon and I will probably get another set for it as well.I have been using these pedals for about 2 months now and I have never regretted buying them. I go on both short and long rides (anywhere from 5-50 miles depending on whether I'm going out with my family or training for a triathlon).

I recently got a new pair of MTB bicycle shoes. They have a broader toe area and didn't fit easily into my cages. I noticed there was a recess on the bottom of my new shoes, so I could use a clipless pedal system. I've always avoided the clipless system because on my first experience using them I couldn't get my foot out fast enough upon coming to a stop and I fell over with me attached to the bike.I'm 6'4\" so I fell a long way.  Ouch!I went to my local bike shop to see what might fit my shoes. Mountain bike shoes are a little diffferent than road shoes. Road shoes have 3 screws that attach the cleat to the shoe, whereas the MTB shoes have 2 screws. I like the MTB shoes because the cleats are recessed so you can walk normally when not on the bike. I looked at the Crank Bros pedals and the Shimano. The Shimano PD-A530 Dual Platform Bike Pedal system was what I picked. They are adjustable so you can get the right amount of tension of cleat to pedal. Turning your foot outward disengages your shoe from pedal.One of neat features that caught my attention was dual purpose pedal. One side had the clipless system and the other side was a flat platform so you could use your street shoes if you wanted to just hop on for a quick ride.After using the PD-A530 Dual Platform Bike Pedal for a month I noticed that I picked up about 2 mph speed with same cadence because of the positive attachment.

They've been elevated due to the smooth operation of the Ultegra shifters.  The bar end style of shifting is something you get used to, but you do so quite quickly. They are indeed best for your \"dieseling\" types of touring bikes. I absolutely love them and am quite surprised at just how much operational improvement can come from shifters.

Awesome value, highly recommended."],["Anyone still using down tube shifters on an older bike knows how unstable the ride can be when you take your hand off the handlebars to reach down to one of those shifters.  In an effort to make my ride more comfortable I installed a quill (handlebar stem) that raised the bars about 4 1/2 inches.  This made the reach to the handle bars better but exaggerated the shifting problem.  This kit is the cure, and it will work on just about any classic design (my guess is 1955-1990) bike.The surprise was that the kit comes with micro adjustable stops that mount in place of the down tube shifters.  I thought I was going to have to fabricate something to do this job.  If your bike has down tube shifter braze-ons, this is a straight bolt on application.  My 30 year old Fuji Royale had Suntour down tube shifters on a bracket.  I just removed the shifter bracket,  took off the old levers, and did a little grinding to match the inside curve of the new micro adjustable stops.  The bolts that came with the kit matched the threaded holes on my bracket.  Then I installed the stops to the Suntour bracket and reinstalled the bracket on the down tube.  Job done.  Going slowly, using the old grind-a-little-trial/fit method, I was done with this part of the project in about 30 min.The rest of the installation is straight forward.  All cables and hardware are included in the kit.  The entire project took 2 to 2 1/2 hours.  A bicycle stand makes final adjustments a snap.  I replaced the brake lever hoods, brake cables, and wrapped the handle bars as well.The shifters are designed to upgrade most older bikes.  The left shifter is friction only, will work with any set-up.  The right shifter is switchable index or friction.  Indexed matched to 8 spd hub.  I used the friction setting which should work for any old bike that came friction shifters. My hub is a 6 speed, works great.  These shifters hold their position like they are perfectly matched to the spring tension of my derailleurs.  Complete satisfaction.My first ride was a dream come true.

Using them on friction mode to avoid any potential compatibility issues. Everything included is fantastic, though the one issue about these is that they include some cable housing. The housing lengths on these is a total joke. Anyone installing bar-ends should know that you will need almost double the length of housing that you might have on a typical shifter because of the distance from the bar end itself to the downtube bosses. Especially if you are a taller rider, then the housing doesn't even come close.

Everything was obviously brand new and pristine, and the package even came with all of the cables, housing, ferrals, cable leads, and even some Shimano Housing Stop pieces, that I didn't need for to mount the cables on my bike, but if I did, They would be so useful! I am thoroughly pleased, and this weekend ride to skull valley and back was less the trouble because of my dreamy new shifters! I still can't believe that my derailleurs didn't need adjusting once after instillation."],["Great product used to convert my wife's hybrid into a dropped bar tourer.  She loves the simplicity of the levers compared to today's multi-levers systems.  Delivery was quick."],["This new old-stock kit is amazing.It comes with everything you need to set up the levers -including top-end high-quality cables and housings, cable stops to fit on your old downtube shifter bosses, and even cable routing stand-offs to smooth out the bar tape as it covers the cable housing.This was a jewel of a kit 10 year or so back when 8-speed was the top-of the line.  Everything in this kit just oozes high-end Shimano quality.  It's the DeLuxe kit with everything you could need other than the derailleurs themselves.The levers are simply amazing.  The indexing of the right lever is so snappy and spot-on it is almost like you barely need to touch them.  They work like an extension of the nerves in your fingers.  If you want to shift 2 or 3 gears at once you can effortlessly do that too.  It's like magic.  There are no missed-shifts or the indexing tripping over itself.  The gears just snap to like little toy soldiers saluting in parade formation.  You will have to experience just how amazing these shifters work to really believe it.I am using a set of these with a 9-speed Tiagra rear derailleur and it really is true that as long as the rear isn't junk the way it runs has more to do with the quality of the shifters and the cable than the derailleurs.  These things are a joy to operate.  I find myself shifting all the time just to feel the gears snap from cog to cog on the rear.The front friction is very nice too. It's just PERFECT when it comes to the right tension.  There is no messing around.  It's very easy to trim the front and it stays PUT where you leave it until you want to move it and then it is as smooth as silk.If there were 6 stars I'd give this product an extra star."],["I've had the 9 speed dura ace bar end shifters also, and I prefer these. They index slightly better since the spacing between the cogs is greater than with a 9 speed cassette. The cassettes are also cheaper.An 8 speed 11-32 cassette makes more sense for me than a 9 speed 11-34 cassette because there was at least 1 low gear that I never used on the 9 speed cassette; the ratios are too close together. The 8 speed provides a better spread with more usability.The feel of shift quality is superb. You won't find a better value anywhere."],["I installed these on my 8 speed road bike.  The install went smooth even though I have never used bar end shifters before.  The included kit was very nice.  I am very impressed"],["My down tube shifters were crap, hard to reach while riding in traffic, and worn out to boot, but I was turned off by the price of these bar end shifters.  I looked closer and noticed that they include the adjustable cable stops for the old down tube shifter bosses, the cables, and housings.  When you add all that up, the price is pretty reasonable.  The kit is very complete, and obviously geared (pun intended) toward vintage bikes.  Mine is an early 80's Univega touring bike, way nicer steel frame than most modern bikes, but tough to get parts for at local shops.  The instructions are a little iffy, but if you've worked on bikes a bit, you can figure it out.  If you've never worked on bikes, or you're not mechanically inclined, get some help from a friend or pro.  For someone who can swap out cables and do basic maintenance, this is an easy install.  I have an old-school 7-speed freewheel with a more modern Shimano Acera d&eacute;railleur, and the indexing with the 8-speed shifter works fine, there's just an extra click that doesn't do anything.  I was prepared for friction-only shifting, but a couple of turns of the barrel adjuster on the cable stop and I was click clicking.My only caveat is that if you have really high/wide bars, you'll probably need longer cable housings than those supplied.  I have Nitto Mustache bars mounted fairly high, and a Wald basket (weird combo, I know, but it works), and the supplied cable housings were barely long enough, but they worked.  If I do it over, I'll add a couple of inches. If you have regular drop bars, you probably won't have to cut the housings or anything.This is a really excellent kit, everything you need to update your old bike to commuter-friendly shifters."],["I bought this shifter set for my 2010 Specialized Allez Double Steel bike.  My bike came with indexed downtube shifters.  Once I removed the original downtube shifters, it was simply a matter of installing the included cable housing stops to the downtube shifter bosses on my bike, then installing the shifters, cable housings, and cables.  The cable housings were already cut to the correct length, making setup quick and easy.  The new rear shifter indexes perfectly on my bike, and the front shifter is a light touch friction shifter."],["Shifts the gears and it does it well. I am very happy with this product.

I went for the Prime and I was not disappointed.  The installation was a piece of cake, the adjustment went precisely in step with the clear instructions, and my bike has been shifting flawlessly ever since.The cheapie OEM Derailleur that had worn out was a Shimano Altus, so the shifter did not present a problem and all I had to do was set the limit screws and the cable length.  Since this was also a good opportunity to clean and lubricate the cable, I effectively, started over with a brand new system.The RD-M591 is a rugged, precision piece of equipment, unlike the sloppy, lightweight piece of garbage that it replaced. The amount of time I wasted trying to tweak the OEM Derailleur turned out to be a testimony to futility and absolute nonsense!My advice is this:If you are having trouble adjusting your Rear Derailleur, and you are following reasonable instructions, it's not you, it's your hardware. Spend a few bucks and replace it with the BLACK, all-metal RD-M591 (you don't need the gold-plated version) and then, you can lean back and just ride, ride, ride."],["I have one of these on my Surly LHT in silver.I know they work real good.And now I needed a new one for my Nashbar Touring bicycle build I am working on but I wanted this one to be in black.This build is a lot of fun for me I am going to use this bicycle for riding fun only but it can be use as a full time touring bicycle as well if the need for it comes."],["This is just the same brand I had on my Haro V-bar with D stabilizer system. It works great and very easy to operate"],["There are 3 types of derailleurs. Short, medium or long. I think you should always run a long cage derailleur, unless you are an expert and have road gears on your bike, not mountain gears. Mountain bikes have a wider range of sprocket sizes, therefore you need a derailleur which has a lot of chain control. A long cage derailleur is simply better at keeping the chain tight throughout all the gear ranges.I was running a short cage derailleur, and it worked, but it didn't work well. The chain would strip under load in the highest gears (small front, small rear), when the chain slack was greatest. This happened, even with a brand new chain and rear sprocket (cassette). Putting on the new derailleur, the Deore M591, required no modification to the chain. It simply bolted on, and it fixed all problems.Let me tell you, I was skeptical that putting a new derailleur would help as much as it did. I had tuned my old Acera deraileur over and over, but even when it was set perfectly, the shifts were sloppy, sometimes it wouldn't go into the correct gear, and often times the chain would come loose and fall off completely while crossing the street and going off a tall curb, this was very dangerous.By simply bolting on this Deore M591, my GT 21 speed MTB with a Shimano hyperglide rear cassette and new hyperglide chain, shifts absolutely perfect. The shifts are instant, and almost silent. I am extremely impressed. The chain is silent now, and never makes any noise no matter what gear you are in. I shifted about 300 times in 2 hour period to test the derailleur, and the chain never once missed a shift or struggled to make it to the next gear, which is really outstanding.Here is how I put the derailleur on:There is no need to cut your chain, most likely it will work without lengthening the chain. Mine worked fine without modifying or breaking my chain, and I switched from a totally different short cage derailleur to this long cage M591 Deore. [Note: I did eventually replace my chain to a new Shimano chain since the old one was in very bad condition, but this isn't always necessary.]I removed the sprockets on this Shimano Deore M591 derailleur and put it on, then I put the sprockets (pulleys) back on. You will need some allen wrenches to do this work. I used some blue thread locker on the primary attachment bolt to the frame. I also put a tiny dab of fresh blue thread locker on the tiny pulley bolts, being careful not to get any thread locker on the bolt shaft, only the threads. The pulleys are the tiny sprockets on the derailleur.To set the derailleur, put the chain on, and pedal the bike before you attach the shift cable to the derailleur. Set the screw that says H, by backing it out slowly until the chain shifts to the smallest sprocket. Now attach the shift cable while your shifter is set to the highest gear 7/8/9 or 10 (the highest gear.) Pull the cable snug, just enough to take out loose slack, and then tighten down the cable hold down bolt on the derailleur. This should be all you need to do. You can fine tune by turning the cable housing adjustment screw on the back of the derailleur counter clockwise, to tighten the cable a little bit until your shifting matches the numbers on your shift lever, or feels correct to you depending on what type of shift mechanism you have.There are 2 other settings you need. If you are installing this yourself. You need to set the L screw. When you are shifting, if your bike chain will not go onto the largest sprocket in the rear, loosen the L screw. If your chain jumps past the large sprocket, tighten this screw, by turning it clockwise a little at a time, until your lowest gear (number 1) on your shifter, pushes your chain onto the largest sprocket, and the chain should not be making any clicking noises.The final setting is the B screw, or tension screw adjustment on the back of the derailleur. Put your bike in the lowest gear, biggest rear sprocket. Now adjust the little tension screw that pushes on the frame until your top idler pulley (top derailleur sprocket) is 1/8\" away from the largest rear sprocket on your rear wheel, you want a very close clearance, but not touching. That's it! You're done!To make your shifts much better, before assembling anything, take a rag with a few drops of oil on it, and wipe your exposed portions of your shift cable with a light coating of oil. The coating of oil will prevent oxidation of the cable and cable housing, and reduces friction. (Oiled cables make a bike feel new again.)With a long cage Derailleur, my chain is now much tighter all the time, and yet I can ride in any gear combination without any chain problems whatsoever, I can ride with the large front sprocket, and large rear sprocket without the chain binding, and I have a 32 tooth rear and a 48 tooth front! I also have a 28 tooth front and a 12 tooth rear, and any of the combinations of these are perfect. The chain is roughly twice as tight in the same conditions as compared to my Acera. To test my bike I went on a 5 miles ride through the city, and also went to a skate park with jumps. I pedaled hard the entire time, and never once had a problem. I went off some small jumps and bumps and tried to create a problem, but my bike shifted perfect the entire time. I also noticed that I am not able to strip the chain under hard pedaling, and the chain never falls off when I go off a curb anymore. All of this is because of the new derailleur. The Deore M591 has impressed me more than any other part I've put on my bike so far. Once it was set, it worked perfect for the rest of the night, and never needed any fine tuning. Amazing."],["I've probably put a few hundred miles on my bike since installing this derailleur.  This was the last piece I installed to finish my upgrade to a 9-speed drivetrain.

My wife's has 48-36-26 (Sugino) in front and 11-34 9-speed (Shimano) in back, for a total capacity of 45, and it shift just fine, too.

I was at Interbike in Sept, 2008 and complained to the Shimano guys then about cheapening the XT rear derailler and was just told...use the front adjustment.The problem is that many (most) mechanics work from the rear of the bike when making cable adjustments. We're used to it and it makes the most sense. But by cheapening the XTR and XT level rear deraillers to eliminate the cable adjustment screw, there was a lot of complaining (and people buying SRAM which still had it).Shimano, in their desire to force cyclists using 9 speed components to 10 speed, have stopped making the XT and XTR components altogether for 9 speed. Many touring cyclists (like myself) do not want to go to the 10 speed components on a touring bike because you cannot get the low gear combinations on a 10 speed (with compact crank) that you can get on the 9 speed triple with 11-34 or 36 cassette. Not only that, but no one wants to shell out over $1000 to upgrade a 10 year old touring bike (that is faithful in a 9 speed combination) with 10 speed components; that's pretShimano did, however, release the Deore SGS RD-591 9 speed and it does have the rear cable adjustment. As I am currently on a solo cycling tour through the Philippines, I visited several high end bike shops in Manila. I was able ot buy one of the old XT RD M-760 rear deraillers brand new for $20 USD that they still had in stock. But they are currently selling the new Deore RD-591 for approximately $30 so guess I'll load up over here. I just hope that the Deore level works as good as the old XT level. Shame that Shimano feels the need to push 10 speed on everyone when it doesn't shift nearly as well as the 9 speeds."],["I mated this with an 11-36 Shimano cassette and existing compact crank set on my road bike.

I received them and sure enough there was a small rattling sound when shaken.  I knew it would drive me crazy to hear that constantly on the road, so I tried to figure out what was making this noise, and finally realized it was a small gray plastic part that covers the spring inside the lever.  I assume it's there for a reason, but I can't decide what that reason could be.  Either aesthetically to hide the spring or maybe to block it from having debris entering it when the brakes are depressed?  Who knows.  I simply got a small knife and popped them out--problem solved.  You could probably super glue them down so they don't rattle too.After installing my NON-rattling levers, I could not have been happier.

When I got drops on my bike, I realized I needed a set of levers for my brakes and I upon my research, these seemed to be the best ones. Shimano makes some of the best high-end bike components in the world and although these aren't priced at $500 like the Dura-Ace STI shifters, these are perfect for single-speed bikes.I have crashed my bike with them and have only scratched the lever, but that's about it.

I've been using them for almost a year now, and I love them.  Here is what I have found:Weight - Compared to my old brakes and shifters, which were the Shimano 600 (Ultegra) standard of 1989, these are just a little bit heavier.  My old set was very light, though, so these aren't really as heavy as I make them sound.  The materials used are lightweight materials.Build - I like the way the feel.  They are solid, they work smoothly, and they feel like they can take some abuse.  My biggest gripe is that the little shift position indicator on the top is noisy.  It rattles throughout the entire ride.Action - Braking is perfect.  The action is smooth, and they work well with the brakes I have.  Shifting is awesome, as long as you adjust your derailleur properly.  I found that it took a couple of days of riding and adjusting before I finally got it perfect, and then shifting was incredibly fast and smooth.  Keep in mind, my derailleurs are still the old 1989 Shimano 600 set.  For those that don't know how these ones work:  Braking is the normal pull-back or squeeze action, but shifting is done either through the press of a small thumb button for shifting in one direction, or the twist of the brake lever to the inside of the handlebars for shifting in the other direction.  It takes only a few miles to get used to the shifting action.Size - I found these to be a bit big for my hands at first, and I'm an average sized person.  However, I discovered a little adjustment screw under the hood that allows the levers to move forward and backward for adjustment.  This helps a lot.Cables - The cables are my biggest complaint.  These only came with shifter cables, and no brake cables.  I've had these less than a year, and the shifter cables are already coming apart.  The brake cables I currently have are four years old, and they are just fine, and my previous shifter cables lasted several years without needing replacement.  I'm currently shopping for replacements for cables, as my front derailleur cable will only last a few more days."],["I was debating  on my old Trek 1400 with downtube shifters - replace the bike / upgrade the bike ?What a win these were-- I also took the opportunity to upgrade the handlebars (Profile Design Aris OS Bar (Black)) and add a threaded-to-threadless stem adapter (Profile Design Threadless Size Converter (1 - 1/8-Inch))  -  and the old Trek was back in the game.  The packaging included shifting cables but not brake cables.  Be sure to get the proper model \"stops\" (which mount where you remove the downtube levers) to fit your particular bike - despite having a \"round tube\" my Trek needed the \"flat\" mounting type of stops (in my case these:Shimano Shift-Boss Flat Barrel Stops (Black/Silver)) .Dialing in the derailleur adjustments is tricky if you haven't done it before.. the Park Tools site has great howtos for this kind of thing.If you have a mechanically sound 2x7 bike with downtube shifters and are looking for a high-yield / low cost upgrade - this is it.- J"],["I purchased a Schwinn Seneca to have for a training bike. I like the bike, but I didn't care for the thumb shifters that were right next to the stem. I'm used to the STI shifters. The 7 speed brifters are hard to find now.

I have been doing my own bike repairs for a long long time so I knew just how to install them.I didn't need the downtube kit because my bike already has the fittings. It took about an hour to unwrap my bars, remove the cables and the old brake levers and thumb shifters. Install the new STI brifters, run and hook up all cables then re wrap my bars with new bar tape.Adjusting the front and back Derailleur took maybe 15 minutes. I have to say I really like these shifters. The click is very sold, and the shifting both up and down is smooth and quiet. They feel nice and solid and they have good feeling hoods to rest your hands on when riding. I do not regret my decision one second on buying these. I would not hesitate to buy another set. Some people like the little button on the side, and some don't and prefer the paddle under the brake lever. For me, I like both styles the same. I'm not a racer but I,ve been cycling for years and have used both. If you have a 7 speed bike with thumb or downtube shifters and you want the Brifters, then get these you won't regret it.Remember: if your bike has a 3 ring front crankset, they have a 3X7 model as well. that's the one you need for a triple front.

They work smoothly, (wonderful indexing/clicking on both front and rear) but had to adjust as to not use either the smallest or the largest chainring (bike had a 50/40/30t). I resorted to just use the two bigger chainrings- quite a struggle with steep uphill (or its just my own physical &#34;non&#34;prowess- which I hope would get better as time goes by) but could go faster on flats or downhill.

Just to confirm what I thought I already knew about the process, I watched some online YouTube videos to help with the install. The only minor disappointment was the shift cable comes out of the side of the shifter instead of running along the handlebars. The brake cable runs along the handlebar.

You stay secured in the pedals which is very unusual at first especially when you are going around turns or when you are falling and try to put your feet down but they don't come off. That's very fun. I know from experience. You kick your legs in panic mode trying to get free and nothing. Then, right after you hit the ground they pop right out. Its really quite funny! But, all else aside, I ride stuff I have never been able to ride because I can generate so much more power from being able to push the pedal down and pull it up at the same time. I will never go back to regular pedals. My wife had a very hard time unclipping and took a nasty fall on a rock and was done with clipless. I talked her into trying one more time and got her a pair of the SPD 56 Cleats that allow you to unclip in any direction and she has done SO much better. When you first get them stay on the pavement and keep clipping in and unclipping constantly so it will become second nature. This is the most important thing. I didn't even after my friends advice, because I'm hard headed, and took a fall that could of been avoided with practice. Get a pair and never look back."],["I've got these pedal last summer and am a very satisfied Shimano customer since then. They are small but really easy to fin in and maintain perfect contact for any activity. You may adjust the tightness if you switch from road to mountain bike. Great pedal , great price - thank you Amazon!"],["Great pedal at a great price. I placed these pedals on my Cx bike and have nothing but high recommendations for them."],["Amazing, the difference is remarkable, should have done this a long time ago. and no practice, just went for my ride, don't be intimidated like i was, it is REALLY easy. I didnt even adjust the tension, it was perfect."],["I'm used to running all top of the line Shimano components (XTR) as I used to race. Several years later, I'm only riding a few weekends a month I didn't need the latest and greatest. These pedals were easy to adjust and I had no trouble breaking them in on my first ride."],["These are just as good as any other spd pedal out there. They may be a few grams heavier, so the gram counters aren't going to like them much. Easy to clip into, and to unclip. They are getting scratched for the clipping and un-clipping. I didn't buy them for looks, I bought them for function. They function just fine. They do what they are supposed to, and don't cause problems. These are rebuildable, but are so cheap to buy when you can catch them on sale, and last so long, it seems rediculous to think about rebuilding them. Wear them out and get another set. I use these on my 'cross/gravel bike"],["I initially used hybrid platform/SPD pedals on my new Bianchi. But it occurred to me that I never used my road bike \"casually\" and that the SPD side of my pedals were not the easiest to clip into. So I ditched them for these beauties instead. First, they look great. I got mine in white and the finish of both the painted and metal parts is just aces. They have an incredibly small foot print.Using SPD pedals on a road bike is occasionally frowned upon. The reasons they'll give you are almost always half baked. SPD pedals work great on road bikes, the added efficiency that SPD-SL pedals offer is really offset by the convenience SPD cleats offer when you need to get off your bike and walk about.These pedals are easy to clip into and more importantly easy to clip out of. Decidedly more easy than their SPD-SL counterparts in my opinion. You can tune the pedals to be more easy or more difficult to clip in or out of. I used them with the settings they came with and I've had no problems yet."],["I have a hybrid bike with Shimano platform/SPD pedals, so I wanted SPD pedals for my new road bike so I didn't have to have more pairs of shoes, and these have been great for me.  They adjust easily for greater or lesser resistance...I had them unclip at a bad time once but just increased the tension, and they've been great since...they unclip without difficulty but hold the shoe well, which is important as some of my cycling is in traffic and requires some on and off of the bike.  Bonus: the white ones were on sale, and my bike is white, so they look great, too!  Like the bike came with them even...."],["I have a set in black as well and bought these again with a new bike.  They're heavy, but they work extremely well.  I've trashed the black ones and they still work flawlessly."],["I use this pedal on my road bike so I can use the same shoe when riding my mountain bike. This pedal is a bit heavier than most road pedals but the convenience of using the same shoe for both bikes is worth it."],["I'll start off with this is my first venture into clipless pedals.  Any complaint I previously read about these were that they were heavy, IMO I should lose weight before I start complaining about the difference of a few grams.The low price starting point is the reason I bought these, and well the name Shimano is normally synonymous with quality.  I had thought about buying a campus pedal so I could get started and not be as nervous.  A review I read brought the idea that getting in and out of clipless pedals as a beginner is a rather daunting idea - much less trying to make sure you're on the right side of the pedal to clip into.  I installed the right pedal first and did a Saturday of riding with one clip-less pedal and one non clip-less pedal.  I did a lot of stopping and clipping to make sure I had a basic feel for it.  Next day I changed out the other pedal.  All and all I really like the pedals, I probably have 200 miles so far on them.  I did loosen the tension on the pedals so I could more easily clip in and out.I would suggest making sure you have some grease during the install, and when installing the cleats I would make sure you put some grease on the screws going into the cleats.  A wise man once said &#34;If it has threads, put grease on it.&#34;"],["I actually own two pairs of these--one in black and one in white. The white pair is apparently &#34;E-PD-M520&#34; while the black (this item) is just &#34;PD-M520&#34;. There is no visible or physical difference. They weigh the same, coming in the same box with the same cleats and the same oily film.However, they are excellent pedals for a commuter cyclist who doesn't want to be miffed by a single sided SPD, like myself. I've got these both on my road bike and on my fixie now and haven't yet had the problem of missing the pedal. You can literally just mash your foot into it and you'll clip in. They're also big enough to allow you to get up to speed and then clip in should you need to.As for their mechanical longevity--it's about as good as any Shimano product. The weight of the parts is the only factor, and these aren't particularly special, so there is more steel, which means they'll last longer--at least until a bearing failure happens, which shouldn't unless you're 500 pounds of pure leg muscle."]],"title":"Shimano PD-M520 MTB SPD Bike Pedal","total_reviews":18,"sentiment":0.6877,"label":"positive","best_review":["I've got these pedal last summer and am a very satisfied Shimano customer since then.
