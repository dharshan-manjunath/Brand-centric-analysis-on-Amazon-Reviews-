They are the right size to be held in hands and carried all over the place.  Easy wash.  Durable.  Has lasted a lot of car rides and trips out to the store.  I suggest not bringing them in to the bathtub."],["I paid a few dollars more than what this is listed at right now. My daughter is a little over 2 and a half and LOVES Mickey Mouse and anything Disney. When my mother went on a cruise at the end of last year, she picked up a similar set but they had cruise outfits on and it had a cruise ship with it. It was almost $30 for that set.When I bought this, it was almost $25. Well worth it. The other set, Pluto did not last long. I noticed a shadow at the bottom and noticed it was mold. I tried to clean it, and in the process, I messed up the bottom of the toy. I really did not think my daughter would notice but she kept asking where Pluto was. I said he was taking a nap. I felt bad and immediately ordered this set.I love these more than the ones on the Disney cruise ship because they are a lot bigger! My daughter lit up when she saw them! She played with them all day and then she took a bath. I will warn you, be sure to get all the water out of the bottom when your child is done. Squeezing it is not enough; you have to bend the bottom of the toy to get all of the water out to prevent mold growth.My only concern is the paint. It seems thick and my daughter has had them in her mouth a lot and I am scared she might be chewing on the paint. I let her know not to chew them but sometimes she does.I am happy with these and hope they last."],["These are bigger and brighter than I expected...would be great for the tub or baby pool too. They are built to last."],["My two year old absolutely loves these bath toys. They are very cute, durable, and are a large size. The only thing we didn't like about them was the fact that, just like with most bath toys, once water gets in it's very hard to get out. You can spend 10 minutes trying to get all the water out of these things and then still be worried that mold will form on the inside. These are not the typical cheap bath toys you feel comfortable throwing away and replacing every few months, so we actually cut a hole in the bottom so they will fully drain. They don't squirt anymore, but my son likes to fill them up and dump the water out like a cup so it's a win, win for everybody! Definitely a good buy with some modification."],["I bought these as a Christmas present for my special needs 5 year od daughter. She loves playing with them in the bathtub and out."],["The Disney Mickey Mouse and Friends bath toys are not just for the bath,my daughter takes them in the tub and they are her favorite toys out of the tub. They are approx.6 inches tall and very detailed and colorful. I think they are well worth the money,a lot of fun for a toddler, and just the right size for their hands."],["The description indicates these are for the pool and bath... but they really are not. They have holes in the bottom and they squeek... water and moisture will get into them if you put them IN water and they will mold inside *sigh*... they are cute to play with and chew on, I guess, but NOT for the pool or bath"],["My two kids are in love with Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and these toys are their very favorites of all their toys. They sleep with them, take them in the bath, to school, to eat, the park, they go everywhere! Highly recommend them. I'd just avoid using them in the tub because they tend to retain water and its hard to squeeze it out. So I think too much water time and they would probably mold inside."],["bought it for my two year old grandstand and he loved it.Would recommend to littles one who love Mickey Mouse"],["My 3-year old twins love them - can throw them around, squeeze them and they never break!

They are perfect for him to hold onto and big enough that he won't try to eat them.  They are the perfect Mickey set."],["Every time we get out these toys for the tub or pool the question is asked where is Daisy? Really only one girl in the group? All the other sets we have gotten included Daisy. This set is large and easy for my grand daughter to handle. She likes to give them water to drink. And why is Donald so mad? I bet because Daisy wasn't included."],["I love this toy set because the characters are so vivid and smiley. They are actually big, not like some sets that you can barely see the figure. Also the colors are great. It is overall a beautiful classic toy set that any age child can enjoy. Best Mikey product in my opinion."],["A great product....my son loves them....very durable and nicely made! My son loves Mickey and was super excited to play with these in the bath tub!! I would recommed this product!"],["My 2yr old and I really like these toys. They are bigger than I thought (which is a good thing). Decent size and my little guy likes to play with them in the car, bath, pool, floor, pretty much anywhere. The plastic seems pretty durable so far, so I&#8217;d say they are a good buy. The carrying case is nice for storage too."],["My son adores Mickey Mouse and he loves these toys!  They are considered bath toys, but he plays with them all the time.  They are not squishy, but they do have a hole in the bottom.  If we do decide to use them in the tub I will just stick a dab of hot glue over the hole.

She got hooked on them after playing the Palace Pets' game on our iPad. Beauty is one of the many she received this past Christmas, and is her second favorite--right after Treasure.  It's really cute, and is made of some type of hard plastic-type material, with a fluffy tail.  Beauty is really small, standing at less than 3 inches tall at her highest point.  Other than her head, which swivels, Beauty does not have any moveable parts.  Each palace pet comes with her tiara and a brush for her tail.  The Palace Pets' tiaras have two tiny prongs that are inserted into matching little indentations on the PP's head to hold them securely in place, while allowing them to be easily removed. Because of their small size, they are very convenient for travel. My daughter actually keeps Beauty, and a few of her other Palace Pets, in her backpack to play with on the bus-ride home from school. She has had Beauty for almost 4 months now, and it is still in excellent condition, attesting to its durability. Palace Pets make a great gift for any little princess! I have to say though, that the prices I've seen here on Amazon for some of the PPs are quite exorbitant--some as high as $16.00!

The shed is too low for some of the trains to pass under.  For instance if you put a barrel in the Troublesome Truck it won't fit under the shed easily.  Rocky doesn't fit either.The other problem is that the Cranky's tower needs to lock in the upright position better.  When little hands go to use Cranky it tends to fall down.However, this one is fun.  My son really enjoys playing with it. And compared to some of the other Fisher Price Take N Play sets this one's problems are pretty mild.  For example the Knapford Station and the Tunnel train sets are really poorly designed.Please refine our Thomas sets!!!! Thomas deserves better!"],["My grandson loves Thomas, so I got him Crankie to go with his other thomas engines. He love it but the track doesn't fit any of the track he already has. So I went back thinking that I would just buy track but they told me that the take n play sets can only connect to other take n play sets.

Cranky is the Brendam Docks tower crane, loading & unloading ships and keeping things moving despite his gruff nature!  Another colorful TnP set, it has bright green Cranky (his name emblazoned on both sides of the very top) who can raise up/collapse down 2 levels and has a red knob on the side of his \"head\" that raises and lowers a large white (magnetized) hook, a red crossing gate that lifts up and down along the grey oval track, a little red barge boat carrying 2 blue barrels (magnetized so they can actually be lifted by Cranky's hook!), a brown loading dock, and a little open ended area covered by a grey roof/side (with window) where Salty (included!) can duck in for cover if there's a storm!  The track has two different points where it can be connected up to other playsets or additional track so Salty can continue on his adventures and other trains can visit!  Our grandson's Talking Salty \"lives\" at this playset as well.  He first appeared in TV Season 5 (1998) and on TnP's original Spring 2010 Collector Checklist.  We paid $24.99 for our grandson's, and he really enjoys it!  (Update:  Fisher-Price's summer 2013 MSRP is $25.)Update:  There are 11 playsets in the TnP line as of summer 2013 that fall into what I've come to categorize as an \"intermediate\" range of between $25-$30, and they are (in order of introduction:  Cranky at the Docks, Tidmouth Sheds, Knapford Station, Knapford Holiday Celebration, Sodor Steamworks Repair Shed, Sodor Search & Rescue Center, Twist & Tumble Cargo Drop, Thomas' Treasure Hunt Adventure, Thomas' Shark Exhibit, Paxton at the Blue Mountain Stone Shed and Arctic Exhibit.  The great thing about these sets (and those I categorize as \"basic\", with under $25 MSRPs) is that he can very quickly and easily disconnect and fold up the basic sets, and even the intermediate sets relatively so, and take them with us on excursions!A little of our own \"Thomas\" history... As first time grandparents, my husband and I wanted to start some type of collection for our grandson that he could possibly pass along to his own kids one day.  Our grandson was 2 1/2 at the time, and had been talking a lot about a certain train named Thomas (a little fella whom - now seems hard to believe! - we'd never heard of.)  After doing some research, it seemed the Take-n-Play line might be the perfect investment to engage and encourage his active imagination, as well as provide a fun way for us to interact with him.  What a rewarding decision... we've had SO much fun together with this quality line of trains, vehicles and playsets!  He's now 4, and a large portion of our basement has become a wonderful Sodor land of make believe that we all enjoy visiting - and continues to hold his interest, which is quite a feat given the tendency at that age to move in and out of toy phases so quickly!"],["MY SON LOVES THIS TOY.

The boys play with them for hours and they never break.  I also like that they use their imagination instead of a remote control or other electronics.  The toys help them entertain themselves instead of entertaining the kids with a toy."],["I was hesitant to buy this plane at first because I was worried it was going to be too small.  I bought this plane for a 2 1/2 year old who loves planes and helicopters. The product recommendation is for over 3.  But it turned out to be fine.  He really enjoys playing with it and the toy seems very durable and made well. You can press the \"trigger\" button and make the plane spin. I really wanted to buy the slightly larger planes but since it was before Christmas the prices on those planes were insanely overpriced.  This plane worked out to be great and is fine for small hands.  I highly recommend buying this toy."],["This plane works as advertised. We don't have any of the problems that others have reported with the pilot falling out of the cockpit as the plane spins, and we're able to put the pilot inside, although I have to do that part for my three year old. However, the &#34;saws&#34; that stick out the front are just plain silly, and the spinning action doesn't seem to make the toy more fun. It would have been just as much fun to have a toy that didn't spin. Imaginext has a plane where you pull the triggers and make the propellers spin--that makes sense. But to have the whole cockpit spin around and around? Not really.Still, my daughter flies it around the house occasionally (although she doesn't use the spinning feature much) so it does get played with from time to time.Oh, my six year old wanted me to tell you that &#34;the fact that it spins around is bogus.&#34; :)"],["**UPDATE** 11/30/12My son STILL LOVES this toy. He plays with it just about every day. We're looking for a few of the more complicated planes for his 3rd birthday in 2 days. He still has trouble getting the pilot into the cockpit sometimes, but I'm honestly thinking that's because he thinks the pilot should stand up and face any \"enemy\" planes head on, which says more about my sons tenacious personality than the quality of this toy. Our cockpit still snaps closed and now that he's figured out how to use the trigger to make the plan spin, watch out, he's a winged terror, defending the skies of our living room and the air over car carpet world in his bedroom. I literally cannot say how much we LOVE the imaginext line. I can't wait for Santa to bring home the Talon Castle from the layaway :)Even as a write this, I hear the high pitched \"humming\" sound my son makes when he's flying this, and he's spinning around. He just turned 2 in December, and has been flying his wheeled vehicles in the air after watching some space adventure cartoons so we felt it prudent to get him a toy with wings.Price wise, I did not buy it on Amazon, but we paid the same price(11.99) at our local store, so it was an excellent purchase.Quality wise, I'm in love. It's thick and sturdy, and this particular model doesn't have propellers to tangle in hair, or yarn, which is what I was worried about when checking out the other types they offer. The cockpit cover snapped into place with an audible snap and hasn't popped open yet. I inserted the pilot, wearing his helmet(had to wiggle it a bit weirdly to get his legs in there, had to insert them, push them forward while holding them above the \"console\" and then push him downwards to be seated properly). I don't actually think my son realizes that the pilot can come out yet, but I'm in no hurry for that, lol.It's a great size for little hands, and even bigger ones. My son hasn't grasped the concept of squeeze to spin yet, but that too will come in time. I actually believe this particular model could be marketed to kids about 18 months and older instead of the 3 to 8 year old age range they have on it now.Overall, a very wonderful purchase and product that lives up to the fisher price name. Definitely recommend it for your favorite little guy!"],["My son said he wanted an &#34;indigo airplane&#34; from Santa for Christmas. Oh geeze, where am I going to find one of those? Thankfully, Amazon's search options are awesome, and the Sky Racers Twister Jet popped up. This thing is perfect! I thought, so I placed the order. My son loves it! The moving parts are interesting, but not too complicated for him to manage (he's almost 3), and he loves taking the pilot in and out of the cockpit. I'd read a few reviews that said the pilot didn't fit in the plane, or that he fell out when the plane spins, but we haven't had this problem. If he's properly inserted and the cockpit is snapped shut, he stays in. I really love Imaginext toys, and I'll be looking for more of these for my son's birthday."],["My boys love this airplane. They love all the imaginext toys, and this plane is one of their favorites. Would highly recommend to anyone with little boys whose children love airplanes."],["My 4 year old cousin loved the toy.

They liked it at the time but that is all I have to report."],["My 4yo received this for his birthday.  It has gotten almost daily play in our home over the past three months.  We have not had problems closing the cockpit (as another reviewer mentioned) and except for a little paint rubbing off, it is showing no signs of damage or wear.  My 2yo also enjoys zooming around, altho' his hands are not strong enough to squeeze the lever that makes the airplane spin.  We have had other play airplanes but those have cracked or broken when dropped (which happens at this age).  This was a great buy and seems like more expensive gift than $10.  We like it so much, we are going to get the Tiger airplane for our 2yo so the boys can play together."],["I ordered this for my 3 1/2 year old son for Christmas. He loves planes, so this one is perfect, especially for his age. It is much larger than I expected, and is well constructed and sturdy, it looks like it can withstand how some young children play with their toys. I think it looks much nicer in person and I am very happy with this purchase and I am sure he'll love playing with it too."],["Bought this for my 23 month old son.  He loves it....neither he nor my 3 1/2 year old are able to squeeze the trigger at the tail of the airplane to make it twist yet.  But that doesn't bother them, they just like me to do that part once in awhile.The frustrating thing is, hard as I try, I cannot get the man to fit in the airplane and close the top if he's wearing his helmet.  Maybe it's just ours, but the top cannot lie flat if he has his helmet on.  Not to mention, the man falls out when I push the trigger, (spinning the airplane) because even without his helmet, the top doesn't close securely or latch.  Thankfully, I've convinced my son this is *funny* that the man falls out, and not something to be frustrated about, but I don't know how long that will last!There are a few features I really like on this airplane--the weapons that can fold out, the wheels that can fold down underneath the airplane, and that there are no batteries required.  First two things are just fun things my son can do to alter his plane, the last is a nice change of pace when it seems every toy requires batteries nowadays!The toy is made very sturdy.  I have bought my son a couple other airplane toys and when dropped, they've cracked.  We've had this one now for a month and it's been through a lot in that short time but is still holding up very nicely."],["The one and only thing I dont like with this toy is that it's hard to get the guy in the cockpit just right to latch down the door.

The size and weight may be a contributing factor to this.  Have only had it one month so am not sure durability but boys like the extendable saw blades on the front and having the pilot fit well in the cockpit.  It's a toy whose feats are limited only by lack of imagination."],["We got this for my nephew for Christmas.

It's almost like the idea came straight from a child.  Aside from being a cool idea the toy is well made and fun to play with.  The wheels go up and down, the chainsaw blades fold out, and there is a trigger underneath the tail that spins the entire jet. The pilot fits in the plane and can be played with like an action figure. The head, shoulders, legs and wrists move. The whole thing is just plastic but it's not very flimsy.  We don't allow our kids to throw toys so I don't see reason this won't last a few years.  Some of the stickers may peel off.  Overall a very cool toy.  Oh and I found a cartoon featuring the whole line of these toys on YouTube but it was pretty dumb so I decided to let my son think up his own adventures."],["My son just got this toy for his 4th birthday.

While the toy didn't look like much at first, it turned out to be a perfect choice for my young son.The jet features a trigger on the tale that allows a child to spin the wings and cockpit of the jet in a complete 360 degree turn.  It also features retractable landing gear that's chunky enough for little hands to easily push them in and out for quick landings and take-offs.  The cockpit opens up and allows children to snugly put the pilot with or without his helmet inside.  The cockpit shuts tightly and we have yet to experience any unexpected \"ejections\" of the pilot while the jet is \"in flight\" or \"dogfighting\" with other jets.  There are two chainsaw blades tucked under the wings that can be flipped in or out while the child is playing as well.Extracting the jet, pilot and his helmet from the packaging was easy, which is a plus in my book.  With a few simple snips, the jet was free and ready to take to the air.This toy is very sturdy, and has taken quite a bit of punishment from my son already.  It's been dropped and thrown with no visible damage at all.This toy has also triggered my son's imagination.  He's had numerous adventures with this jet and each one gets more perilous than the last.Overall, I highly recommend this toy to anyone who has a young pilot in their midst.

It comes with quite a few pieces:Fireplace (which sings, lights up, makes fire noises, and has a wreath that spins), Pink Couch, cats, a plate of cookies, a pillow, a blanket, and a plate of other snacks. My daughter LOVES the fireplace-every other time you push it a Christmas song plays and the wreath on top of the fireplace changes to a Christmas wreath.The couch isn't great-the only person that really fits on it is the young daughter that came with our house-the adults (mom and dad) are too big to sit on it together, so my daughter now just uses it as a bed for the young daughter.Also, I got this at Walmart after Christmas in their clearance stuff for literally $2.00 (once their Christmas Clearance went 90% off), so if you're patient, b/c this is labeled \"Seasonal Room\" you should be able to get a deal!Overall, it's a nice set and I would still have paid $15-$20 even if I hadn't gotten a deal.

I guess I bought it mainly for myself but any dollhouse needs this set - it's cute for any time of season - Christmas lovers will adore - I keep pressing the buttons for the music and find myself watching the fireplace sparkle and listening to it crackle.  The music is quick (and fairly loud) and there are two little songs for each season. It's a must have.  I think any child will love this for their mini dolls.  The only thing is I received a bench that is pink with brown cushion - nitpicky, yes, but I really kind of wanted it exactly as pictured. The cats, also, have black spots, not orange. Also, as a plus that I didn't realize before purchasing - the top pops off the ottoman for storage!  The package was fairly easy to deal with when opening, although you will need scissors to cut out just the blanket as it seems sewn in there pretty good.  I couldn't &#34;hulk&#34; it out of the package without having to get up and go find something sharp, though I did try."],["Wonderful addition to my daughters' doll house.

It's easy for her to move, rolls well, and is durable enough that she can lean her entire weight against it as she pushes without it tipping over or breaking.Although the zoo animals only work with the zoo set, this truck does make noises when the driver's seat is pressed down, but my daughter really didn't care about this.

I had to put the batteries in and assemble the track (definitely to hard for my 3 year old). Once it was together we had to figure out how to incorporate it in with the rest of our track. I would totally recommend getting one or two of the \"ramp\" sets so that you can fully utilize both levels of the clock tower. The 4 songs that it can play are a definite plus."],["This is a fun accessory for the basic Geo Trax system. The tower chimes and plays music when the light sensors are triggered by a moving train.

Just one warning; it is wise to also get the raised track so the 2nd level of the tower can be used along with the ground level track."],["My 3-yr old son has been asking for this Clock Tower since he received an elevated track set for his birthday in Feb. We finally broke down and purchased this and it doesn't disapoint! He just loves it. We've already put it up several different ways with the help of Mile High Mountain and another elevation set. Even my 10-month old gets in on the action (much to her brother's frustration) and hasn't been able to hurt it a bit She just loves the chimes!

With 3 AAA batteries it will also chime and play music when vehicles pass through the upper two levels.  Pushing the chimney on top will clang the bell.  A simple rotating wheel at the top will change the selected sounds.  Otherwise the sounds will cycle with each pass through.The lower portion can be removed givving a shorter tower and an elevated intersection track thus enabling even more interesting set ups.To use all three levels of the bridge you will need two sets of elevation ramps (six ramp pieces total) or one set and the mile-high mountain.  But however you set it up, it will bring plenty of fun."],["My son received this for his 3rd birthday.  This clock tower is a must for your elevation series of Geotrax.  It makes it easy and fun to incorporate all levels into your existing track.  You will need a couple of the elevation sets in order to do this though. We have sort of made the clock tower the centerpiece of the track.  We have 1 of each of the 3 elevation packs and that's enough to connect all the elevation accessories we have (clock tower, suspension bridge, mile high mountain).The sound level is perfect for this toy, as the lighthouse seems too loud for little ears.  The clock will play 4 different songs as trains pass through the tower and a light sensor sets off the song.  You can also hit the little chimney at the top to set of a chime.  The toy will shut off on its own after a few minutes with no play (it may be 15 minutes, not sure).  It will chime to let you know it is turning off.  Great feature, as batteries aren't cheap!Definitely add to your Geotrax, its worth it! Your child will love it and so will you!"],["My son loves his geotrax.  Seems like you never have enough track.

The Geotrax system is simple enough for him to use and, although only one train can run at a time for him, he loves switching between trains and having mom create new layouts for him.  One hint to prospective buyers:  rechargeable batteries!  For the initial price, they are well worth the investment.  Thanks, Fisher-Price for a great toy!  We love the music and the bells and connecting the tracks to both upper and lower levels!"],["The Clock Tower is better than I thought it would be. I like the many levels of play (3 including 2 directions in the middle level) and I like that it rings when a train goes through it. However, it does not ring every time. I'm not sure why, but sometimes a train will go through and nothing will happen and then one will go through a minute later and it will ring. The biggest downfall is the sound. Normally I think kids' toys are too loud, but this clock tower's chime and music is not loud enough. When you have 4 trains running, the noise from them all really covers up a lot of the sound from the clock tower and it can be kind of hard to hear. But overall my son loves it and has a blast playing with it and I guess that's what most important."],["We bought this and other geo trax sets for my 2 year old son.  He rarely goes three days in a row without playing with it.  The tower is one of his favorites.  Its great how the tower chimes as the trains go trough and its great how it can separate to be use in two different areas of the track layout.  My husband and I enjoy making the track layouts.  I'd say this is a toy for any age  The only draw back is the more sets you get the harder it is to store.  But that doesn't stop us from wanting more.  It's the greatest."],["Really cute tower! Just bought it for my FIVE year old daughter....she has had the Geo Trax system for nearly 3 years.The chime sounds are so sweet....she loves that is does it all by itself... we have one set of the elevation tracks, so were able to run it through one level, but as the package says, you don't really need any elevation tracks at all.Sets up quick and is a GREAT addtion to the layouts.

After a couple of minutes of no train activity, it will turn itself off.The only down side would be that it's a Plus if you have lots of track and it requires some elevation track.

Hopefully, this toy will inspire the future chefs and create camaraderie and not fights within siblings."],["This is a very simple BBQ set for young kids and at just $30, its affordable.  It comes with just a few pieces, so I do recommend picking up a few other food pieces if you don't have any others.  I'd say its for kids 18 months to 4 years old, its small but tall enough for kids to stand and play at.  Its perfect for future tailgators or kids that want to be just like dad (or mom) grilling!"],["We bought the Fisher-Price Grill for my 3 year old son's birthday.  He towers over the grill and the grill does not have a back to it. The lid keeps coming off and the doors are hard to close.  My 1 year old can pull it down.  I love Fisher-Price merchandise but I do not recommend the grill.  We still wanted my son to have a grill so we also bought Step2 Fixin' Fun Outdoor Grill and love it!"],["My 3 yr old granddaughter absolutely loves this toy, and it's provided hours of entertainment as she &#34;cooks&#34; on it.  With that in mind, here's the rest of the evaluation.The toy assembled very easily and didn't involve a lot of excessive packaging. No tools are required--it snaps together.It's simple--no batteries, no bells & whistles, just fueled by pure imagination.It's sized right for a small 3 year old, although it may seem &#34;small&#34; to larger/older children.It's light enough to move from bedroom to living room and back again without any strain.The same things that make it great are also it's negative points.The easy assembly means that it isn't a particularly durable toy for children who are hard on their toys.It's not a toy to leave in the backyard in the sun or it will soon be a mess too.It snaps together easily, but you do have to take time to ensure everything is properly lined up--trying to hurry through the assembly process is apt to cause flimsy tabs to simply snap off.Parts can also be snapped off even during moderate play, requiring minor reassembly (the 3 yr old &#34;fixed&#34; it herself)Overall, our opinion was that it was a good value, providing hours of imaginative/mimicking play for a child that took reasonable care of her toys.  It would be a poor choice for a child that was abusive, destructive or rough on their toys as it lacks the durability that they would need.  I'm not sure it would be a good choice for a home with many children/visiting children (like a home that did day care) because of that durability issue.  Because of the lack of durability, it lost a star--otherwise, it would definitely be a 5 star toy!"],["Fisher-Price has created another super fun toy for children. Hours of play, pretending to BBQ; just like Dad and Papa. Heavy enough construction it will last for years (perhaps generations like some other F-P toys we bought years ago.) It is 100% washable, and can be played with inside and outside. It is just the right height for my grandson age 3. Measures 22\" floor to top of lid; 10\" deep; 19\" wide. It is light (5lb) enough kids can move it themselves; yet sturdy enough it stands well. If it tips, and it can, kids can set it upright. Lid and doors are moving parts. NO choking hazards. Good deal for the price-exactly as pictured.We also own a F-P kitchen set that has accessories which work well with this grill.An educational safety toy as it can be used to demonstrate the danger of children being around a real HOT grill without having to use the real thing. Good for boys or girls.This was the easiest to assemble toy I have ever put together. No tools needed. Instructions perfect. I had as much fun assembling as Frank does grilling hotdogs.A FANTASTIC DIVERSION for kids to play with while real grilling is happening nearby with a dangerous hot grill."],["This Toy impressed my family for several reasons.  Fitst, it is realistic looking and cute.  Second, it is very easy to assemble, with no small parts and no tools necessary.  The adults liked the fact that the set featured hot dogs as well as fish.  They liked the idea of introducing healthy foods at such an early age.  They also valued the fact that it has knobs and so teaches gripping and coordination.  The kids loved the fact that they could stand near daddy and do such an important job.  I recommend this toy for any little person whose family grills. J.

If you have a 2-4 year old toddler who likes to hang out in the kitchen with you and take stuff out of the drawers (speaking from past experience here), then this is the perfect little playset. It is a bit on the small side, so I don't really recommend it for any kids over 4, as it is more in the toddler department than the junior one. It comes with a hot dog and fish and tongs and has cool glowing coals to cook the food. My son enjoys it on a daily basis and always brings me hotdogs and hamburgers (from my mcdonalds playset which I highly recommend if you can find).

It's nice to have long-term confidence in a company.My 7 year old grandson and I put the grill together this evening.  We were able to do it fairly quickly with no tools.  I will say that when you are putting the pieces together, be sure you hear a click when they snap together.  I didn't do that when I put the sides and grill surface on.  Then, when we went to put on the doors, there was too much space to hold them on.  I went back and pushed a little harder, got the click, and everything worked the way it should.  The problem I had was definitely user error because the instructions do say the pieces click together.  This is not a very substantial toy.  If you have a child who likes to climb on things, it will not hold up to the weight of a child.  My almost 3 year old grandsons had a good time playing with this, but the hood came off pretty fast.  It was easy for them to move to the other room since it isn't very heavy.One problem I have had with many children's toys is that the boxes are for display and they are very difficult to wrap.  No so with this one.  It is in a solid box and would be easy to wrap, in case this is being given as a gift."],["It's a bit on the flimsy side, but my daughter seems to enjoy this toy.  the grill is quick to snap together.  It comes with tongs, a hot dog, a gish, and a hot dog bun.  We already had a few food toys that go well with this.  I would keep this as an inside toy, as it isn't very durable.  We also pretend the bottom of the grill is an oven, so that's a nice bonus feature that you can open the doors and store things in there.  So far, we have gotten a decent amount of play from it"],["The quality of materials was ok.  The opening and closing of cabinet doors could have been better.  One door sticks and the other sometimes comes unseated when opening and closing.  My biggest disappointment was in the overall size.  This grill is very small (short) compared to most other toy grills I had seen.  I expected it to be larger.

I'm not sure why I didn't pay better attention to the age range, but at six when our youngest plays with it, he is on his knees and it's still tiny.  I could see this for a 2 year old.But it was easy to put together, unfortunately it feels very flimsy, and I would hesitate to use this for outdoor play. On the other hand, that's exactly what I would want it for-so our youngest could be outside with dad and grill as well.The little knob in the front does make clicking noises, but there are no lights to simulate coals getting warm.  The little food items that come with it-a hot dog and bun, a fish-feel nice and sturdy, although the tongs are very thin and flimsy.For just a few dollars more you can get a much sturdier and larger grill perfect for outdoor play from Step2.

They really liked the function where they can record their own voice and play it back, giving orders to the Heroes and my wife and I get a kick out of hearing what they record.  The set was pretty easy to set up and only took about 10-15 minutes total.  The one downside is the any character with a backpack on has to take it off before being placed in the tower, or he won't fit.  Also my youngest has a hard time making the figures grip the elevator and he sometimes get frustrated when they fall.  The set came with the original Jack Hammer who has a flimsy plastic jackhammer.

His guys climb the outside, spiral down the pole, and store their backpacks when they need a rest.  It is his favorite toy, and I doubt that Christmas will bring any toys to replace it.

The first thing he did is line up all the Rescue Hero figures next to the box and say &quot;It's your house!&quot;.  He has climbed on top of it, tipped it over, and carried it all over the house.  It is surprisingly sturdy, and doesn't tip as easily as I expected (he weighs 30 lbs, and I've caught him climbing on it a few times). I know it says for ages 3 and up.. but he seems able to play with it just fine. It doesn't have small pieces to get lost.

We purchased this one b/c it was smaller and a fraction of the price and was unsure if this was going to be a short lived fascination.  He loves the toy and has not stopped playing with it. The best feature is that you can record your own voice and play it over and over again. What child does not like that?  He tells the recorder which mission he is conquering and requests for help from the other rescue heroes and plays it back and it makes him feel important that his voice is announcing the details of the mission.  He also loves the elevator that the heroes spiral down from.  A definite find especially since it is discontinued and an old item.  This toy does not have some of the negatives of the Mountain Command center such as pieces falling off. We have found it very durable so far.  Also, it did not take long to put together at all.

The sirens are neat to play with too, but for the cost, I don't think it is very durable. At Wal-Mart, they sell it with one rescue hero, and a rescue hero video for a price of $20. Overall, if you get this item, shop around. For the price, it should come with something other than just the command center.

Heroscape is billed as a \"Build and Battle\" game system - it consists of many kinds of interlocking plastic tiles of varying sizes representing different kinds of terrain. Figures representing heroes and squads from different eras and different genres (sci-fi, fantasy, horror, action movies, etc.) do battle on this terrain in a game that is both extremely fun and very easy to learn (and get sucked into). Heroscape: Marvel is the latest additon to this ever-expanding miniatures game, and is a worthy addition at that.Heroscape: Marvel includes everything you'll need to play a Heroscape game right out of the box: terrain (representing grass, asphault, and concrete), a two-story ruin, dice, numerous kinds of markers, 10 Marvel Comics pre-painted figures (very nicely done and very sturdy), and 10 game cards outlining what powers each figure has. The game is also accompanied by an illustrated full-color, detailed and easy-to-learn rulebook. The 10 playable characters in the game are: Spider-Man, Captain America, Silver Surfer, Iron Man, The Hulk, Thanos, Red Skull, Venom, Dr. Doom, and The Abomination.As an avid Heroscape player, I have to say that this is one of the most ingenious expansions of the game thus far - adding in the Marvel characters will add a whole new dimension to the game - although, beware: the included figures look exceptionally powerful. This game is completely integrated into the pre-existing Heroscape format, so if you already have Heroscape sets, you'll be able to bring this set in seemlessly. If you're completely new to the game, this is a perfect place to start. You'll be amazed by the quality and the hours of fun that Heroscape will bring to people of all ages. Highly recommended; designed for children 8 and up."],["My boy loves this set, with heroes he knows well, and those he doesn't. He really enjoys putting together the scenery, together with the other sets he already owns, and the figures are great for the imagination. Good value present in my opinion."],["My girlfriend and I were bored one evening and drove to Wal-Mart to see if we could find some interesting new board game. This wasn't what we expected to find, but we thought it looked cool and decided to give it a try.Well, the box says \"Ages 8+\", but this gave a couple of young college grads a good time. We set it up and were immediately impressed with the set-up of the game. You can literally do ANYTHING you want with this! We played one basic game, which is REALLY basic but good for getting the mechanics down, and immediately played with the Master rules. After getting through one \"round\" of play, we had to refer to the manual only twice, and that was just to make sure that we were doing it the right way! The rules are super-intuitive once you get used to it, and many will seem like second nature if you've ever played video games that are similar to this set-up.We're excited to build our own maps and stuff as we get a little more used to the game. We felt a little geeky using a 20-sided dice, something usually found in D&D.; It didn't matterThis is an incredible amount of fun, much more engrossing than Risk or Axis and Allies because the rules don't constantly get in the way of gameplay and because you can make ANY map that you want!Before we finished playing our first game, I hopped on to Amazon and bought the Rise of the Valkyrie master set. While the characters aren't compatible, ALL of the terrain tiles are. I'm excited to do something more with this game on a larger scale, and the \"Master Set\" allows for that.The only reason for a \"4\" on durability - the \"ruin\" of the warehouse in this set is supposed to fit on a track on a special terrain tile, but mine came out of the box slightly bent and won't fit. It just leaves room in my mind for future damage, though I hope not."],["This is by far the cheapest \"master set\" you can buy for heroscape.  It comes with a decent amount of tiles and 10 really cool marvel super heroes/villains.  I have seen the gripes about how these characters are over powered and don't mix well with the heroscape universe.  Well, to be honest, I'm a purist, so when I play Marvel, I use only Marvel characters, so that's not an issue for me.  The only big thing to realize when buying any heroscape set is that, chances are, you wont be happy with just one set because no matter how many ways you build it or change it, it will always feel limited, and Wizards of the Coasts have officially abandoned this line, so there likely will be no expansions or addons of ANY kind for this product, unless someone else buys it.  So just beware when you buy that you will likely be mixing it with other heroscape lines, or making/buying custom tiles/armies to expand this product."],["This set was a lot of fun for my son and I to play with. It can help with simple math; counting, greater/less than, etc. The only downside was many of the figures had minor defects in them, like warping of the Silver Surfer's board, Spider-man looking like he's doing the limbo, etc. The cards are also just cardboard, so having them layed out, a few got stepped on.

Either we use what we brung, to managle a NASCAR analogy, or 2. We put all the heroes and squads together, and hold a draft for each separately.  Option #2 allows for seamless integration, as it gives everyone a chance to share the super powers associated with the Marvel guys.  And Thanos is out of this world!  Plus, you can't go wrong with Silver Surfer."],["HeroScape in general is my favorite table top game. This expansion in my opinion has the 10 best heros you can play with.

And I do NOT regret buying it! All of the qualities are a great build-up to the game overall:-The 10 figures are small enough to fit on a space on the battle board, yet so detailed. The detail is so specific and all of the features match those of the real (although fictional, I'm pretty sure we have an idea of what heroes and villains look like) characters. I couldn't imagine them being any more realistic and all of the characters have an equal amount of detail put into them. I was surprised, because I knew they were so small but I didn't know it was possible for them to have so many additional lines and bumps carved into them. I almost want to put them on display, but I keep them in the box anyway, so they can stay in good condition/won't get lost until I want to play again. It's like buying everything in the set and getting ten extremely cool action figures free with the purchase.-The terrain pieces are built so that they can connect to any other terrain pieces, grass, cement, or rock. The pieces are very sturdy and I haven't had any problems with them snapping or breaking or getting scratched/scuffed somehow. They even work good if you connect and build your battlefield on a soft surface.-This set works as a great extension to any Heroscape set!-It's really fun to play, it keeps you entertained for a long time, and sometimes, you can't use basic attacks so you have to get reduced to strategy. The battle lasts a while, though, so start the game when you have time.-The breakable wall is also a cool new addition. Just hide behind the wall to surprise your opponent by breaking it or go on top of the wall to stay away from people who can't get onto the wall by jumping/gliding/flying.Overall, this game's awesome! I would recommend it to anyone who likes board games or wants to have fun-you don't have to be a Marvel fan! Or just use it as an extension to your other Heroscape sets. Either that, or just buy it for fun-it's a good deal!"],["These games say \"Ages 8 and up,\" but my bright five year old son loves to play, with supervision of course.  Monsters that fight? And daddy wants to play too?  What could be better?  As with the other Heroscape games, there's not tremendous complexity in the way the pieces interact compared to other collectible games (Magic: The Gathering, for instance).It's great for teaching simple math and probability, too.  I love seeing my son calculate, in his head, whether rolling three \"shields\" on six dice will be easy or hard. (For the un-initiated, you roll lots of dice for each attack or defense, with each die having two \"shields,\" three \"skulls,\" and a blank.  So three shields on six dice is unlikely.)  We also get to add up three-digit numbers as we calculate the point values of one army compared to another, so he gets to learn about spending a limited resource.  \"You can have this one hero, or these two squads, but you can't afford both.\"Comparing it to other Heroscape games, this one is deliberately overpowered.  It's all heroes (in Heroscape parlance, even the villains qualify as evil heroes) and no squads, and the unit's power ratings are quite high.  But so are their point values, which makes it feasible to integrate them into the army of dragons and ninjas you may have from other Heroscape sets."],["Its kinda small, but my nephew likes it, so that is all that really matters.

It is fast moving and is a very simple concept.  Up to four players choose a board between animals that are fliers, walkers, swimmers or climbers.  (Each game board is numbered from 1 to 10 with the same number of animals under each number.  And the animals are categorized so it helps with number and types of animal recognition.)  The game pieces are then put into a cloth bag.  Each player starting with the youngest pulls out one game piece from the bag.  The player then looks at his/her game board to see if they have a match.  If so, they cover that spot on their board.  If not, they give it to the player who does have a match. if no one is playing with that game board they put the matching game piece in a separate pile.  Then it's the next players turn.  And the game repeats until someone fills up their card first.  We play until everyone's game boards are full.My 6 year old son doesn't mind playing this with his sister and even my 8 year old niece has enjoyed playing it.  Even though the older ones don't mind playing it I wouldn't purchase it specifically for the older than preschool set.  But it is a good game that everyone can seem to agree upon playing.  The game was definitely worth the money.  We have gotten our money's worth out of it for sure."],["My kids really enjoy this game. It is different then others that they have but still within their grasp. The only thing that could make it a little better is the size of the bag. It is not big enough to have all of the pieces in and mix them up well. You have to mix the pieces first, then put them in the bag. Otherwise you pretty much pull them out in the order they were put in."],["My son is four and he loves Diego 123.  It's awesome for:  counting, number recognition, color matching, and identifying and categorizing animals (as to whether they are swimmers, flyers, walkers or climbers).  With four category cards and 10 different animals featured on each, there's the opportunity for your child to learn 40 different types of animals.  It's fun and educational and we highly recommend it.  P.S. We also purchased Dora ABC, but it doesn't come close to offering the quality or learning potential of Diego 123."],["We bought this for our Diego obsessed 4 year old and have found it to be a fun and enjoyable game.  When the pieces are drawn from the bag, we match the color to our board.  If it's our piece, then we can match animals as well as count them.  It's great for number recognition, especially for the younger set who might be confusing a few numbers.  E.g. my son still has trouble with 9 and 6.  We've also noticed that a few of the animals could be included in more than one group so we talk about why that animal could be a climber and a walker, for example.This game does move a little slow, especially if you're only playing with two people.  To speed things along we remove the pieces that don't match any player's card.  I also wish that there was a fact sheet giving us some information about each animal.  It would be fun to read facts as we pull the pieces out of the bag.  Of course my son knows nearly all 40 animals featured in the game due to his obsession with Diego.  But it'd still be nice to have a fact sheet.All in all, this is not a game I roll my eyes at when the little guy asks to play it.  And if he suggests Candyland, you can bet I counter with this one!

I didn't think it was very educational, my daughter paid no attention to how many of each animal was on a \"tile\"--they're cardboard, so there was no counting.

He has trouble waiting his turn to spin and the repetitive counting gets old for him.  This game is great!  It helps that he loves Diego, and he loves looking at all the different animals.  This is primarily a matching game for him right now, but as he gets better with numbers perhaps he will be more interested in counting the number of animals on each card.

I was over-joyed because I had one when I was her age. I ended up decorating the crown, although I'm sure she could have handled it, I just think she wouldn't have thought to make a pattern to make it look nice.Setting the game board up is a little hard. You have to remember how the colors go otherwise it won't fit just right. It's like a puzzle almost.The jewlery is just like the classic game, simple and easy to take on and off. Yes it's cheap and that's a good thing seeing as how both my sister and I have forgotten to take off one piece well after we played the game. The jewlery even fit me at 22 so even us big kids can play!There isn't much difference with this one and the original except you have a Cinderella themed board edges and clock tower. If the original is cheaper then get that one. It won't make a difference to the girl because the game is still the same.The only downside was when we played with just two players it was hard to get rid of the clock tower (which you need to, to win). We would just end up going around and around the board either trying to get rid of the tower or trying to get the \"take any piece\" circle to get the crown. We ended up making it so that if you landed on the clocktower after you already have it you can put it back on the game board. I think with three or more players we could just keep circling but with just us we use that  cheat.Another thing for us was when I tried to open one of the earrings it fell apart and this was the first time we played it.

The original has a better crown (and it matters to some girls) and a mirror on the box for them to admire themselves (where a cinderella decal appears on this jewlery box.) But I think the most glaring differences are that instead of the black ring being what makes you not win, this includes a cardboard clock set at midnight, which just doesn't match the fun of the \"Black Ring of Doom\" and that they switched out the Green Jewlery for the Yellow Jewlery. (The Green is much prettier, and it's in the original).Again, if you just want to play Pretty Pretty Princess, go for the original.

She absolutely loves playing it. My wife apparently always wanted this game when she was a kid and she loves playing it. My sons 5 and 3 love playing it. The game play goes as follows: spin and move the glass slipper on the board (helps kids with numbers and patience while taking turns). Then whomever gets all there color of jewelry wins the game (must have crown and not have the clock tower). That's it. Simple family fun.

It is true that it could be easy to lose some of the jewelery game pieces but that is why you just have to make sure and keep the separate from other play jewelery. And if you do lose a piece it's not too hard or expensive to find replacements.

But is serves it purpose just fine :).I give this low marks for educational and durablity.BUT the jewlery box and spinner are a nice & durable!! If they put the same effort into the WHOLE game it may be worth buying.My daughter DID enjoy dressing up and playing a game together so that salvaged a star for the game."],["Okay, I know the box says \"ages 5 and up,\" but I think this must mostly be for the choking hazards.  My daughters are ages 3.5 and 2, and we play this game a couple of times a week.The entire premise of the game is to move your colored slipper around the board where you land on pictures of various pieces of jewelry.  If you aren't already wearing what you land on, you take the piece out of the jewelry box and put it on.  To win, be the first person to get your necklace, bracelet, both earrings, ring, and crown.Pros:*  Easy to play.  Very simple rules.*  Easy and fast to put away.  All pieces have a definite place inside the box.*  Entertaining for my preschool daughters who pretend princess 24/7.*  Teaches basics of playing board games such as taking turns, moving the number of spaces on the spinner, congratulating the winner (we princesses curtsy to the winner), putting away the pieces when finished, etc.Cons:*  The target ages.  I would not leave my preschoolers to play with this game alone due to choking hazards and flimsy jewelry that I'm sure they would break in no time.  But I doubt that an older kid would find the game fun because there's really no challenge:  you just win by luck of the spin.*  Cheap, cheap jewelry.  Much less durable than regular Disney princess play jewelry.  After game play, you'll want to put these pieces right back in the box to keep them whole.*  Some assembly required.  When you first open the box, you decorate the crown and jewelry box with tiny, plastic, sticky-backed \"jewels.\"  These are so little that even I had trouble handling them and getting them where I wanted.  The idea is that the child can decorate the crown the way she wants, but I really think most small children would find the small pieces frustrating.Bottom line:  Good for teaching game play to your youngest princesses-in-training if you're willing to play along or at least supervise.  Likely boring for the listed 5-and-up crew."]],"title":"Pretty Pretty Princess Cinderella Edition","total_reviews":28,"sentiment":0.8871107143,"label":"positive","best_review":["Great prices!!!

There is also a pretty fun alternative game that includes using the One Ring.

As a Tolkien fanatic, I got easily into \"The Lord of the Rings\" theme of the set and started immensely enjoying playing Monopoly. The Tolkien backdrop gives the game a colorful dimension. If you're a Monopoly player and Tolkien fan, this game is an obvious must-have. However, Tolkien readers (or anybody who enjoyed the recent films) who aren't much into Monopoly or have never played it will find this is a great way to discover this classic board game.The play is almost unchanged from regular Monopoly: roll the dice and advance your tokens (in this case, metal figurines of Fordo, Aragorn, Gandalf, Gimili, Legolas, and Galadriel) around the board, buying up \"territories\" (instead of \"properties\") and charging rent from the other players to try to bankrupt them. Instead of money, this edition uses \"power,\" but the values are exactly the same: for instance, each time you pas GO, you collect 200 power, just as you would collect $200 in the regular game.Almost all the spaces are changed to fit the world of Middle-Earth. The territories are locations along the journey of the Fellowship. Park Place and Boardwalk are now Bard-dr (The Dark Tower) and Mount Doom. The red properties are now Gap of Rohan, Helm's Deep, and Edoras. The four railroads are horses: Bill the Pony, Shadowfax, Brego, and Asfaloth. The two utilities are the Wizard's Staffs. Luxury Tax is Shelob's Lair. Income Tax (the bane of all players!) is now \"Seen by the Palant&iacute;r.\" The Community Chest cards and Chance cards are changed to \"Events\" and \"People.\" An example of a typical card: \"Winged nazgl attack! Lose 150 power.\" The houses and hotels you build on properties are now fortresses and strongholds. The white plastic stronghold miniatures look quite impressive on the board!Strangely, the four corner spaces on the board look exactly the same as in the regular edition: GO, Jail, Free Parking, and Go to Jail. This is odd, since pictures of a car and a policeman clash with the theme of the set. This is really the only flaw in the game presentation.There is a special \"Lord of the Rings\" variation you can play if you want a quicker game with an interesting twist. One of the dice has an Eye of Sauron on it instead of a one-spot. When playing the variation, every time the eye pops up on a roll, a special One Ring icon moves one territory around the board. When the Ring reaches the last territory (Mount Doom), the game ends and the player with the most power wins. If a player lands on a territory where the ring is sitting, he/she either gets the territory for free if no one owns it, or else owes the owner TWICE the amount of rent they normally would. This is a fun way to throw variety into the game, but ignore it if you want to play a full-length game.Parker Brothers has made many Monopoly special editions, but this is the one that got me back into the game, and if you love \"The Lord of the Rings\" (movie or book), I guarantee it will pull you in too. Just be cautious that you don't start pawing the other players' money and croaking \"My precioussss! Givessss us power so we can liftses the mortgage, my precioussss!\""],["This is a very nice theme monopoly board.  Unfortunately the pewter  tokens lack lead (for safeties sake) bend easily.  Aragorn's sword looks like it is made of cheese.  Gimli's axes are a bit limp.  And Sting is a bit warped.  The others were in good shape though.  Had the tokens been made of stainless steel that would have been good enough because they would not have bent.  Over all it is good but could have been better."],["Although we love Lord of the Rings and thought it would be fun having a Monopoly version, we were very disappointed at the quality of this game.  The playing pieces were extremely cheap, as was the board itself, more like cardboard with paper on it.  We hate it!!"],["I loved CLUE and Monopoly when I was crowning.

Instead of Boardwalk and Park Place you have Edoras, Rivendel and Barad Dur.

They've included all the main sites from the movies, the main characters and thought it was pretty clever using the four horses in place of railroads and the staffs of Sauron and Gandalf in place of the utilities.  I think they should have changed jail to Isengard or something else but then I guess they have to keep somethings the same.  My favorite aspect of this game is that they have included a way to shorten it in keeping with the book.  Whenever I've played Monopoly before it always drags on and on and on but in the LOTR version they have the Ring that travels the board each time the Eye of Sauron is rolled and when it reaches Mt. Doom the game is over.  It keeps the game time limit to about an hour which is nice.  I would really recommend this for a fun family/friend get together game night type game.SUMMARY:Fun--5 stars--Can't think of any reason to deduct points now that there's a time limit included.Educational value--3 stars--not much thinking or strategy needed.  But kids do use Math quite a bit due to money and in figuring out interests, rents, etc.Durable--5 stars--I'm not sure what exactly they mean by this.

This is a great game, and as much as i remember disliking Monopoly as a kid, I love the LOTR version. The reason? The One Ring option--place the Ring in the Shire, and every time the eye of Sauron is rolled, move it to the next property. When the Ring reaches Mount Doom, the game is over, regardless of who is bankrupt or not.  This keeps the game from going on and on and on as i remember it doing.The only quibble i have with Monopoly in general is the play money is so flimsy, and this game doesn't seem to pack well into the box once the money is in the sorter.  The lid doesn't fit flat. But it's a great game and our family has enjoyed many hours of play with it."],["For a person like me who is a Lord of the Rings fan and a Monopoly fan, this is a great game.  The rules are the same, so it isn't difficult to play.  It also has the great variation with the ring, which serves two purposes to me.  1. It creates a fun twist and 2. It is a gauge of how long the game will go.  Monopoly is notorious for lasting for an eternity.  A must for all Lord of the Rings and Monopoly lovers."],["Well, Sauron was certainly trying to establish a monopoly over Middle-Earth, so \"Monopoly: The Lord of the Rings Trilogy Edition\" makes sense.  Instead of Boardwalk and St. James Place you now try to win control of Helm's Deep, Isengard, and Rivendel.  Instead of railroads you now have Shadowfax, Bill the Pony, Asfaloth, and Brego.  The goal is now to gather power as you move in and out of these territories, as well as acquiring relics such as the staffs of the wizards.  You can play the regular version of the game or try the special LOTR option, which makes use of the power of the One Ring.The Collector's Edition includes the full color gameboard with a map of Middle Earth in the middle, six collectible tokens (Aragorn, Frodo, Gimli, Galadriel, Gandalf, and Legolas), title deeds for the territories of Middle-Earth, 32 plastic Strongholds and 12 Fortresses, People and Event cards (instead of Chance and Community Chest, e.g., \"Fly, you fools!\" Proceed to go), seven denominations of power (instead of play money), one standard die, one special die with the Eye of Sauron, and a gold toned pewter ring.

The locations that the player is able to buy come strait from the book, and are in order of appearance in the books, going all the way from \"Farmer Maggot's\" to \"Mount Doom.\"  The money that is all too familiar from the original game has been replaced by units of power, and the game pieces are great--they seem to be based on original illustrations for the books, which is most apparent in the \"Gandalf\" piece (tall and thin, holding his staff like on the old book covers).The \"new way of playing\" that has been added to the Lord of the Rings version of Monopoly adds a new strategy. Players rush to claim as much land before the One Ring travels to \"Mount Doom\" and the game ends. It also makes for a quicker game for those who don't have four or five hours of free-time.Fans of any part of the Lord of the Rings phenomenon will enjoy ever aspect of this game--it truly feels like player an entirely new game. It's great and, without sounding too cliche, Lord of the Rings and Monopoly friends alike will want to play this game over and over again."],["The rich lore of Lord of the Rings trilogy is ideal material for fun and challenging games, as the many excellent game adaptations of the Middle Earth world and the Lord of the Rings story prove: most notably the rich and subtle cooperative game by Reiner Knizia (one of the best games available on any topic; ASIN: B00005O0F4) and the much simpler but still quite deep 2-player Stratego-like 'Confrontation' game (also by Reiner Knizia; ASIN: B00006JBPP), both of which, in addition to being excellent games in their own right, are also superbly 'themed': the Lord of the Rings feel and atmosphere comes through during play and one really feels involved in an adventure in Middle Earth. (The 'children's game', again by Knizia, is also worth a look for kids under 8.)But monopoly? Mt. Doom as real estate? This is just \"theming\" to make a buck. Monopoly collectors will probably love this game, but if you want a Lord of the Rings game try some of those just mentioned instead."],["Monopoly is often overlooked as a gamenight option these days, many people considering it outdated. But it's a classic for a reason, combining lucky rolls and strategy in a very unique way.The Lord of the Rings version is a fun alternate version of the game, adding a modern twist to the classic. Instead of the thimbles and hats you are the characters from LOTR. You play for power levels instead of cash, and you own regions of Middle Earth instead of properties. There is an alternate rule you can incorporate utilizing the \"one ring\" gamepiece, giving special power to whoever holds the ring. It's an interesting option, but for the most part you'll want to play by the original rules, all of which are still intact in this version.The fact is that most people don't play Monopoly by the correct rules, and that makes all the difference. The key to enjoying the game is the inter-player deals and politics. That's where all the fun lies, and much of the strategy. Any player can strike any kind of a deal with another player - want to trade all the purples and light blues for Boardwalk? No problem. Want to trick someone into trading a property you need for all your railroads? This is where the real enjoyment comes from. I encourage you not only to get the game and play it, but to read the rules and \"get into\" the game.There are also some fun alternate rules you can use, such as collecting $400 (instead of $200) when you *land* directly on \"go\", or putting fine money (from chance cards, utility expenses, get out of jail money, etc.) in the center of the board and collecting it when you land on \"free parking\".Don't overlook Monopoly as an outdated option. It's still one of the best games out there."],["I hated Monopoly growing up because it took so long to play, and I almost always lost.  However, this new collectors edition gives people like myself a fighting chance!  Since the movies have come out, and having read the 4 books (the Hobbit and the LOTR trilogy), I have turned into a LOTR fanatic!  I received \"Monopoly - The Lord of the Rings Trilogy Edition\" as a birthday gift.  Within the first 3 weeks of getting it, my wife and I played 18 out of 21 nights!  I love the changes that were added.The most exciting twist is the addition of the \"one ring\".  This either allows you to get property for free or pay double the rent.  It also makes it's way around the board, journeying closer to Mt. Doom (which replaces Boardwalk as the last space).  Once the ring reaches Mt. Doom, the game is over.  No more 4-hour games!  I also enjoy the fact that the properties have been replaced by sites from the story-line.  You also can aquire steeds instead of railroads and wizard staffs instead of utilities.Over all, this has been the most fun I've ever had playing Monopoly.  Definitely recommend it for Monopoly and LOTR enthusiasts alike!"],["I love monopoly games, and I love Lord of the Rings, so together, it is the ultimate game. So much fun to play with all of my friends!"],["Monopoly is a great way for kids to learn about money (counting money, giving change, buying, and selling).  This edition is of particularly high interest to middle school and junior school aged children.  This would make a great gift for any student who loves the Lord of the Rings and is struggling in math."],["This is an epic Monopoly !!!!!!! I gave this as a gift to my boyfriend since he's a huge fan of Monopoly and Lord of the Rings and he looooved it. He took this Monopoly to our University the next day and once all of our friends saw it they came running to our table. Everyone was amazed by it.

var LEGO_Toys = [{"asin":"B003F7WK30","brand":"LEGO","imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SvcgBXDBL._SY300_.jpg","rating":[0,0,1,10,23],"reviews":[["I bought this set for my four year old son who loves legos and does a pretty good job putting them together with my directions.  Although the set is recommended for kids aged 8-14, my son likes it a lot and did a great job completing many steps on his own by just looking at the instructions.  In some cases I directed him on where parts go, and I also applied stickers to ensure they went on correctly.The set contains several bags of parts and we built it one bag per day: green car, red car, the truck, and two days for the trailer.  I strongly support Lego's recommendation to not mix parts from several bags together and to open and build one bag at a time.  (I also purchased a used World Racers Wreckage Road set 8898, which came disassembled and all parts were mixed.  It was significantly harder to dig through parts to find what I needed.)These toys are colorful and have many moving parts and projectile launching functions.  My son enjoys them very much.  He likes \"bad\" guys in the red car more than the \"good\" green ones for some reason.One of the problems I found is that these toys are a bit fragile.  When we move the sides of the red truck's bed which convert to \"wings\", or the red truck's windshield, pieces pop off easily.  The engine in the rear of the green car pops off very easily too.  Also, the missile launcher on the trailer pops off.I am not a big fan of the \"two-faced\" minifigures.  They look weird with a face on the back of the head when helmets are removed, but, I guess, this is a personal preference.Other than being fragile, I do not see any issues with the toys and they are a lot of fun to build and to play."],["Playing with Legos was such a big part of my childhood. You always start by building per the instructions and once that is played out it gets destroyed and imaginations run rampant. The same can be said here, only the initial build is much more complicated and extravagant than I remember them being.While younger users may be able to put this together it's probably best for an older (10 and above) child or at the very least some adult help. But, regardless there is a lot of playtime to be had here.This is much grander than the Lego sets I used as a kid but that's a good thing. I can see some quality experience here and many many hours of making new things that only imagination can decide. As always Legos are a time honored toy and one every child should have. This set is definitely worth picking up."],["You can't go wrong with Lego products and this set is no exception.  My son loves cars and trucks and Legos.  Putting them all together is a definite win with them.  My son is 7 years old and had no problem putting this set together.  The only problem we had is where to put all the trucks after they are built.  We had to put them back into the Lego box and they do fall apart to build something else later.  There are a lot of stickers to add to this set."],["Having all the vehicles separated in numbered bags was very helpful. This was a huge hit with my 5 year old."],["My four-year-old nephew thought this Lego set was \"really cool and really fun\" (his words). He's had it for several weeks now and he plays with it almost daily. He needed help to make the vehicles and that was very time consuming. It probably took us a good 5 hours to assemble all of the vehicles. The trick is to follow the instruction booklets in order. Don't open all of the Lego bags at the same time. They are numbered. If you do, you will get all the pieces mixed up with each other and it will take that much longer to find them. Open up the bags as you get to that part in the instruction booklet and you will save a lot of time and frustration.The vehicles come with weapons that shoot out cannon balls and arrows so my nephew thought that was very cool. He also liked the big tires on the racers. I found these instructions to be improved compared to previous Lego sets. They show you which pieces you need and in what quantity at the top of each page so that you don't miss anything. The instructions for other Lego sets previously did not have this so I would get so far, miss a piece and realize too late and then have to undo everything.The only con to this Lego set is that it is very time consuming to put together. If your kid plays on the dining room table and the racers fall off the table, then it takes more time to put them back together. If you have older children who can put them together without supervision, then the con doesn't really apply. Regardless, let the kids play on the floor. It will save everyone a lot of grief.l recommend this Lego set to anyone who likes cars and trucks, regardless of age!"],["I got this for my son so that he could work on it during his Christmas break, but he was so excited, he finished it before the week even started.  He spent all day on it and just loves it.  It was a lot of work and fun for him and he shows everyone that comes into the house because he is so proud of it!  (as I am of him)!  AND you can't beat the price, it's so much cheaper than in the stores!!!"],["First of all, this is not a set for young kids nor for those without patience. While younger folks may be able to put this together, but it's probably best for an older (11 and above) child or at least with some adult's help. There were some parts that are complicated and the instructional booklet's illustrations and directions for the more difficult components are hard to follow.It is very time consuming to put this Lego sets together. It probably took us a good 6 hours to assemble all of the vehicles. This set produces three vehicles - two racers and one tractor-trailer. Having all the vehicles separated in numbered bags is very helpful. The bags are numbered so the parts are kept separate. Don't open all of the Lego bags at the same time. Once you open the bags you are on your own in keeping them separate. And there are lots of very detailed parts to get lost or underfoot.The models look good, especially the race cars. The moveable arm and engine from the tractor-trailer are very cool and stable. The red car can be steered because of its suspension. The green care and the tractor-trailer cannot be easily steered. The small vehicles do not roll easily.Unfortunately, some of the pieces fall off or out of place pretty easily. Lego structures fall apart fairly easily if they get dropped or pulled the wrong way. When that happens be prepared to spend another fair amount of time trying to figure out where everything goes again.I don't like sets with stickers that need to be applied. For this set, there are A LOT OF stickers to be applied. I think the decals are the most confusing things, because some of the items are pretty small. It may take your eye a little bit of time to pick out the right one.So, if you have the time and the patient, this set is well worth the price."],["I bought this for my 5 year old for Christmas.  It was too advanced for him to put together by himself but after we got it together he's really had fun playing with it."],["My son struggled with the directions early on because he didn't realize the books needed to be completed in order for the semi. Also, as often the case with models, his creations were easily damaged by his 4 yr old nephew (my son is 7.5 yrs old). Overall, he was thrilled with this set."],["I received this Lego set to give to my 12 year old grandson - a long time Lego enthusiast. He was absolutely thrilled when he opened the box, and immediately set to putting the kit together. With three sets of instructions, a few bouts of frustration, some help from his grandfather, and a whole lot of persistence, he finally got the kit put together. And he was so proud of his accomplishment! Personally, I think that's one of the best things about Lego kits. Like plastic model cars of old, a child has a great sense of accomplishment once these kits are put together and working. Like other kits he has completed, he enjoys playing with them \"gingerly\" so as not to pull them apart and have to start from scratch. For actual playing time, I rate the kit a 3 out of 10. But for the sense of accomplishment finishing the kit gave my grandson, as well as causing him to practice concentration, focus and following instructions, I rate it a 10 out of 10. This would make an excellent present for any Lego enthusiast in the 12 year old and up age group. And if the kit happens to get \"destroyed\"? That's 961 new pieces for that storage box full of Lego's that gets dragged out over and over again to create something new and different."],["My Grandson wanted THIS set for his birthday. This saved us a trip accross town through heavy traffic to a busy mall."],["We got this for my two nephews and they absolutely love it!  There are plenty of parts to keep them occupied and the trucks are durable enough to use in a sand box, outside in the driveway, etc.  The colors are very bright so fairly easy to find missing pieces."],["The Lego building system is one of the best toys ever, so my standards are pretty high. My review and rating use other Lego sets as the benchmark. An average Lego set is still way superior to other toys.Sets can be rated several ways. First, you can rate the set as built following the directions. Second, you can rate the play value of the set when constructed following the directions. Third, you can rate the set for value, both play and financial. How adaptable is the set to constructing other models? How does the price per piece compare to other sets? Are there unique elements that make the set desirable?When built according to the instructions, the set produces three vehicles - two racers and one tractor-trailer. The models assemble quite easily and, as always, the instructions are excellent. I am always disappointed when sets include stickers that need to be applied. This set includes several long, tapered ones (difficult to apply correctly without great care) and several small ones. It is much better when graphics are applied during manufacturing. The models look good, especially the racecars. Once built, they have the appropriate balance between durability and \"breakability.\" I use \"breakability\" to refer to the ability to be intentionally damaged during play.The play value of the models is average. The red car can be steered because of its suspension. The green care and the tractor-trailer cannot be easily steered. I remember when Lego sets did not include weapons in their sets. This set has several. The cannon on the red car works fine. The flick missiles on the green car are annoying and don't work well.The rebuild value is very good and the cost per element ($.09) is very good. The eight minifigures are very nice, and the trophies and flags are nice pieces to add to your collection.I rate this set as slightly above average."],["I bought this as a Christmas present for my 18 year old son who has Autism.  He absolutely loves the concentration to details it takes to build anything with Legos.  This set consists of three books on how to put it together so he was in his glory and it took him about an hour just to build the semi (and he has put a Star Wars X-Wing ship together in 10 minutes).  This is not a set for young kids nor those without patience but if you love Legos and can keep track of the approx. 900 pieces it takes to build it all then this is a must have.  It's fun to play with since the vehicles can be loaded into the truck.  All vehicles are well built so that pieces don't fall off when being handled.  All in all this is a Lego lover's dream!"],["I gave this set to my nephews (ages 8, 11, and 13).  These kids are always receiving legos as gifts so they are very experienced with lego products.  What follows is their review as well as a few notes from their mother:It was a very clever and well thought out set.  There were some parts that were complicated and the instructional booklet's illustrations and directions for the more difficult components were hard to follow.  There were cool parts in the set that could bend and flip down again and there were other fun details that made the cars and 18-wheeler more realistic  (like a spare tire for example). There were lots of details in this set that made the end product very genuine and fun to play with (after it was built- which is a bonus- with some lego sets you can't \"play\" with it afterward because it falls apart or doesn't lend itself to \"playing\" so you have to just look at it and then it eventually falls off the shelf it's sitting on and is destroyed).  It takes a long time to build this set so you have to be committed and really enjoy building with Legos- (otherwise, you'll be left with lots of little pieces all over the house that mom will inevitably step on, the dog will choke on, or that will break the vacuum cleaner- resulting in mom flying into a fit of unbridled rage- that last part was mom's editorial- sorry).  End result:  2 cars and a big 18 wheeler that function and stay together quite well.  Fun to play with.  Varying degree of complexity.(mom's perspective again):  All three boys (8, 11, and 13) enjoyed putting it together- each was able to work on a portion of it but the 8 year old would not have been able to do the more complicated stuff (like the 18 wheeler- which was the 13 year old's job).  Sometimes the instructions are really hard to follow because it's all illustrations- this is a general beef I have with the more complicated sets."],["I saved this Lego set for my grandson until he turned six which is two years younger than recommended but since he has been building Lego creations since age two I thought he would be fine.  He is thrilled with this set and with the help of his dad built the two smaller vehicles the first day.  It took two more days to tackle the large one and he did experience a little frustration but then was all the more satisfied when he completed it.As with all large Lego sets such as this I would recommend purchasing a dedicated bin that will hold all of the 961 pieces.I have posted a picture of the completed vehicles."],["I put this together with my 6- and 9-year-old sons and my 12-year-old daughter.  It took the four of us about three hours to complete the project, with varying degrees of involvement and effort.  We're not really schooled in 'Lego' (we have more Lego software than toys) so I should mention to those of you who are like us that we enjoyed the assembly process as much as playing with the toys afterward.  It's interesting to see the cars and trucks take shape, and the whole process is sort of cathartic.  My 6-year-old needed direction to assemble the pieces, while the two older ones were fine on their own sub-projects.  The kit came with 3 large instruction/assembly books for the various cars/trucks... all in color with no words and excellent illustrations.  All of the necessary pieces were included in the box, and we had a small bag of leftover parts at the end (not because we screwed up!).The completed project results in a dune buggy (green team) and small truck (red team), along with a semi and trailer (green team support).  The inclusion of missiles and rockets on the vehicles seemed unnecessary to me, and my kids didn't take long to shoot each other in the eye with them (not kidding).  Nevertheless, it kept their attention through the evening as they played out different racing scenarios.  My opinion is that anything that keeps my kids happy and entertained from the building stage through the playing stage deserves 5 stars, so that's what I gave it.I do foresee some minor problems, however.  Some of the pieces fall off or out of place pretty easily.  The trailer for the semi is overall a little rickety.  If my 2-year-old had 5 minutes alone with this set it would likely be destroyed/disassembled beyond recognition.  There's also not a lot of interchangeability, which seems like a major tenet of the Lego program.  Take all that for what it's worth, and you're still left with a fun playset for the family (yes, for me too)."],["Lego's are the greatest creative building toy for any age.  It lets your imagination rule, but the actual construction unit was outstanding and stayed together when played with.  The moving car and trailer is idea and went together very well. Would recommend this to any young boy who enjoys constructing and racing cars."],["I ordered this with the intent of adding to my classroom's bank of indoor recess activities, and I am happy to report that my 4th grade students have been having a blast with this set.  The project catalogs are terrific, and the kids have also been creating their own cars/trucks/etc...LEGO has a winner on hand."],["I thought that turning 12, my son would be just about finished with Lego sets. Not so! He was so excited about this set that he couldn't wait to get home from school and get started on it. It's a challenging build -- the truck especially -- so it's taking him longer than usual to complete it, which is fine by me. With 961 parts and three instruction booklets, he has miles to go before he sleeps.Beats me why there isn't an equal number of red and green team members and why there's a truck only for the green team -- are you supposed to buy all the sets to equalize the teams? -- but it doesn't seem to bother him any. He's pretty proud of his progress and likes the whole racing theme. The vehicles seem more stable than many he's built, especially the ones in theStar Warsline that seem more suited for admiring than playing with.I used to think it would be better for my child to build something from his own imagination, instead of from these sets. But my dad the engineer says he's learning the valuable skill of following a complex set of directions. So, I stood down on this issue. My son's room is a testament to that... floor to ceiling with completed projects!"],["Not only did our two boys (13 & 8) behave themselves in order to get this set but then played nicely for a couple hours putting it together.

This WORLD RACERS set bucks that trend.  The value is inherent as 961 pieces with many unique to this set and 8 minifigures are included.  The truck takes awhile to build but with some little hands helping can be put together in an afternoon.  The little racers that battle it out around the big rig are perfect for younger enthusiasts and can be built with little frustration.  Highlights included the opening trailer that holds the TEAM EXTREME buggy, real firing missile, and ball launchers.  The moveable arm and engine are very cool and stable.  The vehicles themselves hold up to play well without losing pieces and really zoom across a hard surface for real racing action.  A terrific value packed set for the LEGO vehicle lover in your house.  The flick firing missiles are the only \"misfire\" in this set."],["Interesting, well-packaged and with complete build instructions, this is a typically nice Lego brand action set. It has just about a thousand pieces, so it's probably not for the youngest end of the age range of 8-14 years unless your 8 year old is particularly neat and organized. There are lots of very detailed parts to get lost or underfoot, but that is part of the whole building block deal. Our \"product tester\" is 14 years and thought that this was still a fun set. The base kit is set up to make three different vehicles including two \"desert racers\" and a large service vehicle. There are a number of Lego people and accessories, too. These can all be reconfigured into some interesting alternative vehicles. An additional feature is a cannon that shoots, which is mounted on one of the racers.Overall, yet another solid Lego kit. The one comment we would have is that for the size and price, could there have been a motorized element to it like the K'Nex kits in this price range have? A well-done motorized piece would get five stars."],["I got this Lego set with a certain young man in mind.  I wanted something that would be challenging, fun and stand up the excellent Lego name.  In looking at the product, I found all of this to be true.  I did find a few things that annoyed me- the box not being resealable being one.After I had done a short evaluation, I forwarded the set to the young man with a very serious charge: HELP ME DO A REVIEW!  His work is below.  As you can tell, he took my charge very seriously and I agree with everything he said.\"This is an amazing product. I am 10 years old and I really enjoyed putting this together.  It has 961 pieces and is for ages 8 to 14. It took me about 5 hours total to put it together.Each small vehicle took an hour and the 18 wheeler took about 3 hours. Whenit all came together it looked really cool. The red vehicle seemed to be more difficult to put together than the green one, but they were both fun to work on. The 18 wheeler was the coolest part. It took a long time but held my attention. The more I worked on it and saw it coming together the more I wanted to finish it.One complaint I have is that the numbered bags cannot be resealed. The bags arenumbered so the parts are kept separate. Once you open the bags you are on your own keeping them separate. It's great having the numbered bags, but it would be better if you could keep the bags to put the pieces back into when you take the vehicles apart.Another complaint I have is that once I got the small vehicles together the wheels do not roll easily. I tried adjusting some parts but they are still tight and do not roll well.Now that I have put it together I am not going to take it apart. I have had a lot of fun playing with it. My favorite parts are the guns. One is on the 18 wheeler and the other is on the small red vehicle.This is a really cool set of legos. I highly recommend it to others close to my age. I have had several lego sets and this one is my favorite so far.\"What else can I add to that?"],["I bought this set for my son's 10 year birthday.  He absolutely loved it.  It took him a bit longer to put together which is a good thing and for that reason, he really enjoyed it as well.  This is a good Lego set."],["Just seeing the 'LEGO'logo on the box let's you know you are dealing with a time-tested product. I have never had a LEGO product that has been a disappointment and this one is *not* an exception. It states that it has 961 pieces and who am I to argue, nope didn't sit down to count them, but I am a believer.Upon opening the box I found all the pieces segmented into numbered bags with directions and stickers for each piece. You simply decide which item in the set you want to build, find the bag of the corresponding number, look in the directions for the portion that goes with the numbered bag and then open the bag and get to it. Yes it is just that simple! I personally thought the decals were the most confusing thing, (but not all *that* confusing), due to the fact it is done by matching instead of bring numbered. This is because some of the items were pretty small and on a sheet of varying decals. It may take your eye a little bit of time to pick out the right one. However, it is certainly not a daunting task.It states on the package it is designed for an 8 - 14 year old and I believe that as the pieces are not only numerous but many of them tiny. Individuals without nimble fingers need not apply for job, especially when it comes to the tiny decals.  All that said it made for an excellent, around the table, family project. My oldest daughter, 32 and her husband  and 3.5 year old child are all LEGO fanatics and so we spent a couple of hours sitting around the table building the pieces. The grandson was a bit small to do *too* much but helped out with putting some of the tires together and was very patient waiting for an opportunity to play with what was created. He loved the cars and truck and had a great time then bringing it 'back to the shop' for tire repairs or what have you. The pieces stay together pretty well once built and, in the end, brought hours of enjoyment to children of all ages. Certainly this could be a great family project and of course you don't *have* to build things as they say, though they work out better that way, but can also invent many things of your own.This product is very much true to form with LEGO's reputation for quality - the items were well formed, strong, and very colorful. Considering the price of other LEGO sets I think this is a good price for a LEGO set of this caliber."],["We are Lego fans and they didn't fail to deliver a great product again. My 6 year old put this together in a day and a half and loves everything about it. I wish I was a kid again."],["Over 1000 pieces in this set, so this will keep your kids busy for awhile.  A little more \"restricted\" since the parts are mostly to build the box vehicles but you can still add them to your other LEGO for \"parts\" allowing even more fantastic creations. The instructions might be hard for younger kids to follow the build diagrams of the car and truck so I'd say even though it says 8 and above, I'd go with 10 as the minimum for building the set just how it is on the box.  The set is really nice though, and we found that the kids loved playing with the pieces building their own small things, just as the adults did! The built vehicles stay together pretty well, much better than the space sets I had when I was a child (I had this gray rocket that would fall apart if you sneezed).  I wonder if they will continue this set/series since there is two race \"teams\" and you only get mostly one side here.  Maybe the other side will have a different truck which would make sense for selling another set. All in all, this LEGO set is pretty nice and we'd like to see the red team get a set too."],["I originally got this for my nephew, but when my 4-year-old's saw it and expressed so much interest in it, I thought I'd let her do it instead.  It was a bit over her head--she was able to put pieces in the right place, but only if I was helping.  I'm not surprised--with nearly 1,000 pieces, it's easy to guess that there will be a lot of time spent and a fair amount of concentration and dexterity involved... in fact, that's the point, I would guess.  Even with that being the case, she still got a kick out of it and was excited to see it come together.The build is time consuming, but quite easy as every step is drawn out very clearly.  The diagrams are very well done--not like the many sets of instructions on how to assemble bikes, garage door openers, weight benches... you know what I mean.  Also, the pieces are divided up into several bags, each labeled and the instructions are organized so that you finish 1 bag before you open the next.  It was very well done.There is one big problem with it--Lego structures fall apart fairly easily if they get dropped or pulled the wrong way.  When that happens (and it will if kids are playing with it) be prepared to spend another fair amount of time trying to figure out where everything goes again.  It may be harder than the original build because now you don't have things separated into bags and you won't know which page of the instructions to be on.  Because of this, you may consider gluing the pieces together... just a thought.All in all a fun, satisfying toy.  As the kids get older, I bet they like it even more."],["This Lego Set includes:* 5 green team members* 2 red team members* 1 race official* Green Team Truck - shoots missiles* Red Team Desert Rally Racer - Canon mounted on racer* 961 piecesRecommended best for ages 8 - 14As with other Lego products, this set provides hours of fun and creativity.Best advise - as with other LEGO sets, follow the instruction book.

It's fun for him but it also challenges his mind unlike many of the video games kid's are playing. This set has plenty of features to make this truly a blast to play with. There are many interactive parts and it's really fun to put the set together. The only thing I didn't like was that that many of the pieces seem to be specifically for use with this set unlike the non-themed LEGO sets. Also, certain aspects of the layout could only be made in accordance with the instructions. This cuts down on creativity a little bit but not on the fun. Despite this my godson and I had a great time putting this together.I recommend this set for children of all ages."],["This Lego set is wonderful. The finished product is sturdy and eye catching. Suitable for older tweens/teens, in my opinion. Or perhaps adults who like to build stuff to keep busy rather than doing boring 2d puzzles.I thought that there was no way to justify the price point here but am satisfied with that as well. The set arrived with the parts advertised and putting it together was quite fun!"],["I have to start by saying that I'm 27 years old and haven't played with... I mean BUILT anything with Legos in probably a decade. I got this set for my 14 year old cousin who loves Legos but once I looked at it I decided I definitely wanted to work on this as well. The box comes with 7 labeled bags of Legos and an eighth unlabeled bag that has some additional larger pieces. It also comes with three instruction manuals. This is the largest Lego set I've ever constructed.Bags 1 and 2 are the two cars (a red and green one) as well as the Lego men that drive them. Both cars are elaborate and fun to make, requiring quite a bit of concentration and patience - it's like making a puzzle... a 3-D puzzle that you can then drive around and shoot things with. Yes, the red car is actually some kind of monster truck with a rocket launcher that launches little wooden balls a good 5 feet across the room. Very cool. These were the two parts that I constructed.My cousin handled bags 3 - 7 which ends up being a giant semi truck with a crane that seems to go with the green car (at least color wise). He had a great time putting this together, and said it was one of the cooler Lego sets he's seen as far as final product goes.So, the main point of this review is that a 27 year old and a 14 year old put this together and both thought it was very fun, very cool and fun to play with after it was done... I can imagine anyone younger would have even more fun playing with it after it was done, and aside from a few slightly difficult steps in the process the instructions are very clear and easy to follow.

This set was no exception! The Portal of Atlantis is the largest set from the 2010 Atlantis line, and is chock full of cool pieces and minifigures. My son loved all of the creepy, non-human minifigs and the super-sized sharks, while I loved all of the parts in dark red and gold, especially the beautiful golden gates. One of the more unusual features of this set is the portal at the top, ingeniously structured of see-through pieces and Technic elements so that you can turn an axle to actually open and close the Stargate-like opening. Kudos to the Lego designers for thinking that one up.I thought this was a decent set overall. It was fun for my son to put together... relatively easy on the \"build\" scale, but with just enough challenging bits thrown in to make it interesting. My only complaint is that this set isn't the most sturdy once completed, and because of the way it's put together, it is impossible to mount it on a baseplate structure for display. My guess is that this particular set won't stay put together too long before it descends into our enormous collection of bricks set aside for freestyle building... but as that's when Lego building is the most fun, I can't really complain about that too much. Overall, a great set for pieces or play!"],["This is a very satisfying but challenging Lego building experience. I admit this was my first experience with Lego from my childhood and it far surpassed any previous Lego experience. Before I get into my review a couple of suggestions about this. I would get this for a child at least 8 years old. Perhaps 6 and older would be ok, if they are not easily frustrated and you are willing to spend the time to build it with them. Also for any excited child when they get something new, please be present when it is opened. The building blocks are packed in 9 plastic bags each with a number. The pieces are all pretty small, so opening bags at random (as I would have as a kid) will take building from challenging and fun to a nightmare. Also the small part. If younger kids are present in the house they will have to be carefully supervised. Without that this could be a 1,000 plus piece chocking disaster in the making.The warnings aside with adult supervision the building process can be quite enjoyable, educational, and satisfying. None of the individual steps are that hard but there are a lot of them. Kids will learn patience, persistence, and the rewards of building something themselves rather than just unwrapping or opening a box. The finished product will capture the imagination of any kid with an interest in the sea and underwater adventure (about any kid I have ever known). There fortress turns out great and there are a variety of attack sharks and underwater humanoids to interact with. It is just a really fun and neat finished product that the child BUILT themselves. Instructions are similar to Ikea instructions, pictures no words. Be aware that there are 2 sets of instructions but they are part one and part two, not the same instructions in different languages that happens with a lot of products. I recently bought a great Prism brand kite and our young son loves it and I had so much fun with it. We also have a lot of electronic toy gadgets that I think are fun and educational and worthwhile. But Legos can teach so much. Old doesn't mean bad or outdated, not by a long shot in general, and certainly not here in particular."],["This is one hefty Lego set!  Just over a thousand pieces this will take you awhile to put together using the two included booklets.  I put this together with my 11 year old nephew and he and I both had a blast.  His brother, who is 5, also enjoyed it a bunch but some of the things were to complicated for him to put together easily but it was perfect to have him around to help.  You get a bunch of lego guys and the set is super cool.  While it will take awhile to put together correctly it should give the kids hours of entertainment and will help stimulate their imagination.  While this is not a cheap set it is worth the money if you can afford it."],["This Lego set is big and colorful and easy to assemble with the detailed instructions.

It keeps them busy for hours. If you have a child under 5yrs it would be hard for them and might upset the child. There are alot of little piece. But is fun for the child and dad to put together."],["We have long been a Lego-loving family and have plastic cabinets full of different sets. I was very excited to pick up this set and see what those Lego people have come up with now.Assembly: I set my 15, 13 and 10 year old the job of putting the set together. The instructions for assembly come in two magazine sized booklets. The kids reported that the instructions were clear but they did miss the highlight feature where the bloke to be inserted is highlighted in a different color on the relevant sheet. When the set was assembled the kids reported that they thought an average 8 year old could put the set together with some assistance, especially with the stickers.Play: All of my children and their friends agree that this is a marvelous set for play. They especially liked the special features such as the hidden portals accessible only when you insert the appropriate key and turn the rock. They also liked the Atlantian people who had different looks. The Shark warrior was a favorite with the shark head that can grab things in its mouth. And the squid guy with his head and feet full of tentacles reminded them of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies.  About the only thing they disliked as far as the figures went was the two faces on the regular Lego guys. (One side of the head has a serious face and one side has a scared face.)  They thought that limited the characters, as they must have helmets covering the side of the head not facing front. (It reminded me of Professor Quirrel in the Sorcerers Stone and I found the two faces vastly amusing.)Quality: The pieces arrived in perfect condition, snapped together well and stayed snapped through hours of none too gentle play.Price: Yes, this set is expensive but for the right child the expense is well worth it. Kids who like Legos or are deep-sea toy set enthusiasts should be entertained for hours."],["Bright and colorful, with over 1,000 pieces, this is a wonderful toy that will keep a younger child (and an adult) entertained for hours.  While the set is for kids aged 8-14, I think that it is more suitable for kids in the lower age range; the 14 year old's I know would build this quickly and then get bored.For younger kids, however, this is a blast.  There are enough pieces that it will take them a while to put it together, and the booby traps and moving parts really are amazing.  There is nothing scary here at all - even the \"shark\" is incredibly cute.Visually, the bright colors and moving parts are stimulating.  In terms of educational value, it definitely works on a child's motor skills and spatial relationships.  I was pleasantly surprised by this set.  It is pricey, so this is something I'd save for a birthday or Christmas/Hannukah/etc. gift, and not just something you pick up on the spur of the moment."],["My son is a Lego maniac and has about 6000 Legos.  He really wanted this set for Christmas 2010.  He absolutely loves it and built the entire set on Christmas morning.  He has since rebuilt it dozens of times and still plays with it to this day. For any child who loves Legos, this is a must purchase."],["Overall Building:  Overall, the set is very nice.  It's just over a thousand pieces (1,007) and has some complex aspects to what it does, yet the construction is relatively simple, so even young children can build it.  I worked on the set with a precocious six-year-old (I can say that, because he's not my son), and he didn't have any problems with any sections of the set, including the moving sections.  And it's the moving sections that make this set so great.  The snake-like mouth that makes the entry gate has some neat articulation, so that when you lift the top jaw up, the two lower jaws pull apart, opening up the gate.  And the portal at the top, when you twist a jeweled key, makes the interior portal sections open and close.  The moving parts aren't overly complicated, but they have a pretty big impact on the model, especially the opening jaws, which everyone \"ohs\" and \"ahs\" over when they see it.  I think it's a really good introduction to building more complicated behaviors for younger kids.The architecture of the snake-jaws-gate and the portal are moderately complicated, while the left- and right-wings of the structure are more simplistic, so if you were working with different-age children, the older one could build the central structure and the younger one could work on the sides.  The colors are nice - deeper reds matched with dark greys and blacks, and the jewel-colors of the portal and some of the small accessories highlighting the overall model.I personally love the more detailed sets (like the Green Grocer and Fire Brigade), but that's as an adult (and those sets are recommended for 16+).  I'd give it 4.5 stars for myself, but for the recommended age group, I definitely think it's 5 stars.Minifigures:  The set comes with seven minifigures - three divers, one Shark Warrior, one Squid Warrior, one Portal Emperor, and a skeleton.  The Squid Warrior, in particular, is a really neat and unique figure, one that I'm looking forward to using in future horror and fantasy sets that I put together.  The Shark Warrior and Portal Emperor are also interesting, and I don't think the Portal Emperor is available anywhere else.  The divers are nice models, with double-sided heads so that you can vary their expressions.Usefulness of Pieces for My-Own-Constructions (MOCs):  If you've got a basic collection that you're working with, I think this could be a good model to add to your collection of pieces.  First, there are a lot of unique pieces - the portal sections, the nice gold gates, lots of minifigures, and pretty unusual accessories (tridents, spearguns, etc.).  Second, the deep-red-colored and gold bricks are unusual; I really like their shades and look forward to using them in future creations.  This isn't necessarily the best \"first purchase\" if you're wanting to start doing crazy creations, but if you've got a good basic set and you want to add some unique colors and flair to your collection, this set is definitely worth picking up."],["My 7 year old grandson was totally enthralled by his Lego Atlantis Portal.  He worked on it every spare minute he had until it was finished.  Following the directions was a great learning experience.  Once it was finished he loved all the moving parts and the figures that came with it.  The only negative is that once it is built it pretty much becomes a \"model\" and doesn't get played with but rather set out for display."],["Christmas was coming up and I needed a gift for my son.  Luckily he had mentioned Lego Atlantis.  I checked it out and ordered this set.  We just finished it today (Jan. 5th after starting it on New Year's Day).  It is a great set and we worked on it after school for a few days.  Basically, we'd open one or two of the nine separate bags and see how we could do.  One day I came home to see that my son (6 years old) and a friend had started the portal and had left it on the table in frustration, where my 3 year old daughter was trying to knock it off the table.  Whew!With some review of the directions by myself, we managed to get the gears put in correctly and add another section to the outside ring.  After that, it was smooth sailing.  I enjoyed the opportunity to explain gears to them, but they were a little more focused on pushing through and completing the section.  The two 6 year olds had done pretty well, but that section was kind of complicated.  By the end, my son was finishing complete sections by himself pretty easily.  It was a great learning experience that I am grateful to have shared with him.  He was so happy and proud to have finished and went to bed tonight saying, \"I can't believe I finished it.  Hi-five, Dad.\"  I thought that was pretty great, but I may have created a Lego monster though.I would keep this away from younger children because it is tough to find small pieces that have been knocked off the table.  Happy building."],["Everyone that has a child knows you can't go wrong with Lego's, they're simple enough for any kid to start building straight out of the box, and complicated enough to look for the instruction manual if you're trying to build exactly what you see on the box.Portal of Atlantis is, like any other Lego set, the best of both worlds, such a great theme begs to be built the way it was intended, I always challenge my kids to build the set and then modify it by adding parts and pieces of other Lego sets. It's always good family fun when we can all get together and \"remodel\" Lego sets, a definitely recommend that you tried that with your kids if you happen to have spare Lego parts from incomplete sets he he.Overall, as all other Lego products, quality is great, very entertaining, you can spend hours building with this set alone. Such a great addition to the Lego family whether you combine it with others or not, it's just a great package and well worth the price. Great for any child that likes using their imagination to create they're own adventures. Highly recommend it!"],["This would be a GREAT gift idea for those 10-12 year old Lego enthusiasts in your life and a wonderful toy for kids and adults to work on together.Pro's -OOodles of creative elements. Lego has been around for a long time so you might wonder how they can keep it exciting...this one really manages to do it well. Sci-Fi fans (young and old) will appreciate the exciting Atlantis theme.Detachable sharks, secret keys and doors that open/close are just a few of the moveable portions that will make this more than a mere model for kids and actually allows it to become a toy that inspires imgagination.Lots of part but not a lot of time is required for this one making it a highly desirable option for an afternoon of fun with dad, grampa or other family members who may not have the ability to commit to extended periods of play time but also would like to have a memorable afternnon with the kids.Big box - kids seem to love big boxes and this does not disappoint! One look at this and the eyes bulged out and the beggin started...and that was the 45 year old! You should have seen the 12 year old!

Common sense should mandate whether this applies or not."],["When we opened up this Lego set our reaction was,  \"it is amazing\"!  As one of the kids said, it's \"AWESOME!\"  It took us a couple of days to put it together, because it is very complex (there was no way our younger kids were going to be able to do it, but it says it is for 8 year olds anyway), but the thing really is incredible.  It comes with six dudes (three humans in deep-sea scuba type equipment with spearguns, and three \"creatures of the deep\" type dudes -- a guy with a shark head, a guy with a golden helmet, and a really cool squid-guy with tentacle legs).  Also included are two giant sharks that you build from Legos.The set in itself is also great. There are pieces that are set up so that you can make them move.  It's hard to describe without a visual, but as an example, there is a little wheel. If you turn it, it makes a giant portal-like thing spin open, revealing the treasure chest behind it.  Very cool.  The kids love it.All in all,  it is really fun to put together (for people old enough to do it).  The only downside is that many pieces feel sort of specialized -- as if they could only be used for this set, in the particular way that the instructions tell you to use it.  That cuts against one of the best things about Legos - that you can put them together any way that you want and come up with your own creations.  And man, if we ever take this apart, I doubt I'd be able to put it together again! The pieces were pre-sorted in 9 different bags, so that you only had to deal with putting the pieces together one bag at a time.  Without that pre-sorting, it'd be very hard to do.Keep that in mind, but it is a FANTASTIC set anyway!"],["I became the cool aunt when I brought this to my sister's house to put together with her almost-seven-year-old son. Legos certainly aren't my thing, but apparently they're his, because he had a blast putting this thing together, with my sis and I popping in now and again to help organize pieces or help with directions. It wasn't complete by the time I had to leave, but he was excited that it was staying there and he'd be able to finish it."],["I put this together under the supervision of my 4 year old who was able to find pieces for me, as well as, put together some of the simpler portions like the minifigs. Other than that the age range on the box is pretty accurate for a required skill level. The box came with 9 bags of legos. If you open one at a time, each one builds one stable part of the overall structure and each could be done leisurely in under 30 minutes. This makes it easy to break for lunch or hold off till another day. I've included a photo which shows the build process bag at a time.The moving parts are some of the most interesting in this Lego set. The main entrance is a shark's head that lifts up and the lower jaw spreads open horizontally, it's masterfully engineered to stay open when lifted and with a slight bit of downward push it smoothly closes on its own. The iris portal gate which protects the treasure is opened by turn a wheel, which only engages when one of the 5 keys is locked in place... a nice creative touch there. The sharks that are on the left and right posts move freely on two pins and can be lifted off to be played with separately.For the most part the instructions were very easy to follow and there were only a couple of places where attention to detail was necessary. The biggest place is the iris gate, it can go together only one way and the joints look very similar to each other, also the blades need to be installed with a special attention to their orientation or they can get stuck outside of the iris and have to be reinstalled. Other than that, I found this set to be easier than other sets I've recently worked on from the Creator series, which are also geared at this same age range."],["Although I wouldn't recommend this as a toddler activity, my kids (both 3) enjoyed helping out as the parents build this Lego set.The build quality is great (it's Lego, after all).  In additional to standard Lego blocks, this also includes some Lego people. There are A LOT of pieces and I can't imagine an 8 year-old doing this on their own.  Thankfully, the pieces were pre-bagged in sets, making it easier for us to put this together.The completed project looks amazing!"],["LEGO Portal of Atlantis is a real neat toy set that will entertain the kids whilst they construct it.  The best part of playing with legos is building with them.  The Portal of Atlantis is part of the underwater series.

When the legos are finally constructed, you'll have a fun toy that is a blast.  If your children loves legos then you will want to pick this one up.  The entire underwater series looks like a whole lot of fun and I this one is just the start of it.  It might be a bit pricey, but it's worth it."],["The age suggestion of 8-14 in my opinion is a tad off.  I bought this for my son when he was 9 and it sat in the closet until last year. At 11 years old he finally took an interest in it and built it with his little 6 year old brother watching. After it was build, they had hours of play with it and still do occasionally. I would recommend this but not younger than 9 years of age to build. Kids younger, though, would have fun playing with this after its built."],["This was my first foray into a really LARGE Lego set (like above 500 pieces).  I was a little worried it would be overwhelming.  But in typical Lego fashion, the separate bags for separate parts of the project helped keep things manageable.  Some of the more complex parts were a little much for my 6 year old, but there was plenty to do to split up the work and give him some easier parts.  The actual structures themselves are AWESOME and you really feel like you've built something when you are done!  I think it's frustrating to younger kids when they're done with complex Lego creations and you can't really PLAY with them.  When something with a couple hundred pieces in it falls apart it is pretty devastating!

He was very specific that he wanted to have all of the colors of the \"shields\" that had been included in some of the Atlantis themed Legos and this product is the one that had them all. There are enough different figures and assembled pieces to keep both of my sons playing happily without the fights."],["This was a present for my beloved grandson and he loved it. I thoroughly enjoyed helping him assemble it. I was pleased to be able to obtain it for him, since most retail outlets were out of it and he was very specific about what he wanted. You can't go wrong with LEGO and fulfilling a grand son's wish."],["1,000 pieces of fun. Legos sure have changed a lot over the years. We unboxed this and the kids had hours of fun, but got it assembled pretty quickly. It's going to be a great addition to their Lego collection."],["My kids like Legos well enough, but they've never been overly enthusiastic about a particular set.  They LOVE the Lego Atlantis set.  They walked in and were thrilled to see the set and immediately began making plans on what they would do with it.  They sat down and worked together for hours (miracle!) without fighting (double miracle!).The set teaches them to follow schematics (so in the future they can build furniture from IKEA), be patient and feel satisfied that they made something themselves.  After it's built, there's plenty of creative play with the characters.The set includes just over 1000 pieces and it comes in a large box.  The only downside to this product is the lack of a storage container inside the box.  For the money it would be nice if Lego included a tray to sort out parts when you want to take the set apart and store it.I would highly recommend this set for ages 8-12."],["This is by far the best lego set in the atlantis series.  They are hard to find now and pricey on amazon so look around. With over 1,000 pieces, this set includes so many unique items that you wouldn't find in other sets.  My 10 year old loved putting it together and loves playing with it. Would definitely recommend."],["I picked this set up on clearance and for the price this set is great. I'm not the biggest fan of the Atlantis theme but LEGO's creativity and ingenuity shines especially in this set.First, the technic mechanisms that move both the shark head entrance and the portal are great, so if you like building your models with movable components this is an excellent set to give you both the parts and the ideas.Another thing I love about Atlantis is that you get to build sea creatures rather than just getting a molded animal. In this set, you build a shark head as I mentioned as well as the two shark monster statues.The main reason I bought this set though was for the inventory. There are a lot of unique pieces in this set that I can use in my own creations (arches, dark red stairways, gates, etc) in non-primary colors. The pieces come in black, tan and a rare dark red color - so if you're looking to grow your parts inventory but avoid the usual primary colors that come LEGO buckets, this set is for you.I was a little surprised that for its retail price, it didn't come with a vehicle or a submarine of some sort, so that was a bit of a disappointment.Pretty steep for its retail price but if you can find it at clearance online or in-store, it's a great buy!Atlantis minifigures never appealed to me but you get six of them, including the Portal Emperor which i believe is unique to this set."],["Once this massive thing is assembled it will look pretty impressive. So glad Grandma is here to put it all together for our son!"],["What's to say about this kit? It's LEGO, so you know it's quality. It's a rather large set that goes with the whole Atlantis line, and it includes all the standard parts, including some LEGO people, and some moving parts that will be quite useful in your own LEGO creations. The key is very nice, too. The whole kit makes a really fun gate that opens to reveal a stairway, and all told there are over a thousand pieces in this kit.Honestly, I never built the thing on the box when I played with LEGO bricks as a kid. I used them to make my own things, and with this kit there's no shortage of parts. While I do think LEGO are overpriced considering that they're just molded plastic, you can't deny that in big kits like this they give you a lot to work with. This set seems to be heavy on the black bricks, which were kind of rare in the old days (I remember having to get by with lots of red, green, yellow, and blue). The shark teeth that come in this kit will be really fun to use on other things, too! I never had shark teeth in a LEGO kit before!All told, if you're shopping for a cool toy, there's always LEGO, and the quality is always unquestionable. You can't go wrong with this kit if you have a LEGO lover in your family."],["I didn't grow up with LEGOs.  In fact, I didn't like LEGOs as a kid--I preferred K'Nex.  It wasn't that LEGOs weren't fun or that they had much more variety in their universe than K'Nex; it was the fact that I preferred building on angles rather than with linear blocks.Nonetheless, I'm much more older now, and decided to get LEGOs as gifts for my kid sister.  When I saw this set, I jumped on it and my sister and I started building right away.  My unfamiliarity with LEGOs led me to be unaware as to how many pieces to expect, and how long it might take to build.  I have grad school classes and work, so, in all, it took us almost a week!The LEGO instructions are very easy to follow, and you don't get intimidated because each portion of the set is separated into bags, and you build up from the first bag to the last.We had so much fun building it, even though at times it became a little tiring building hours on end.  The end result was totally worth it (with a little minor snags along the way), and my kid sister stills plays with it to this day.I have much more respect for LEGOs now after realizing how intricate and detailed their sets are, and give many kudos to the designers (I plan on buying my own Star Wars set some day).  Sure, it was smaller than I expected, but with all the pieces that go into actually making it, I'm not disappointed.It separates into three parts so you can easily transport it, and the jaw of the huge shark opens and closes for storage.It's a great set that features many great pieces and minifigures (I kept the shark-headed minifigure), and leaves for many fun, imaginative situations."],["I would recommend the portal of Atlantis Lego set to highly skilled Lego builder and the older age. Because it is a very hard project and it takes a good amount of time. I was 11 when I built it, it toke me almost 3 hours to build. I got frustrated several times when I built it. For example when I was building it (there are 3 sections to it) and I tried to connect the 2 sides to the portal I couldn't figure out how to do it. I also had problems building the ring and portal themselves. Next to that building the sharks is a bit of a challenge. I forgot to mention building the connections on both the sides and portal are probably the hardest part of the entire thing.However once it's done you will have lots of fun with it because you get 6 figures and 2 sharks.  The sharks are attachable and re attachable there mouths and tail move too. This Lego set comes with the most figures in all the Lego Atlantis sets. They come with a fan jetpack and flashlights that are connected to the suits; they can also be moved from figure to figure. It also comes with a camera that the Lego people can hold. The back of the portal is cool too. They have accessories planted all over the back, like a map, a gold cup, a bed, a hanging mechanism, a frog, 2 diamonds hand cuffs, and a giant knife. Keep in mind that these are all plastic and not real weapons.You can also discover on your own all sorts of things that you can do with the Lego set.  I found out many things in the set, See what you can find.  I liked the Lego set very much and I hope you do to."],["This is a hot item, the Atlantis series is the latest creation from Lego. The box is huge, there are 1007 pieces all in bags that are grouped by numbers. These numbered bags coincide with the 2 instruction booklets that have almost 100 pages each. The age group is listed for 8-14, being this is one of the larger sets, expect hours, days of fun putting it together. Its also very colorful and we all know that most kids have multiple sets of Legos so eventually they will get mixed together and create all sorts of fun and crazy things.This set has 7 action figures: 3 divers, 1 Portal Emperor, 1 Squid Warrior, 1 Shark Warrior, 1 skeleton along with some mechanical moving parts like the opening Portal to Atlantis, Sharks mouths (with teeth that are sharp). Also are gates, staircases, traps, treasure chest, tridents, 5 Atlantis treasure keys: a green, a blue, a yellow, a red and an orange (circular symbols). This is a very detailed set and again is a few days project. There are shark figures too that are removable to play with or can me attached to the towers to act as guardians of Atlantis.Everyone loves Legos and this is another great series of play sets. I don't have any complaints other than the 2 instruction booklets and that is was a lot of work to put together."],["This set was discontinued and my Grandson so much wanted it for Christmas!!! I received it brand new and the quickest shipping I ever had for any item at Christmas time!!!  He will be ONE HAPPY little guy!"],["I gave the LEGO Portal of Atlantis to my 8 year old godson and he absolutely loved it. It's fun for him but it also challenges his mind unlike many of the video games kid's are playing. This set has plenty of features to make this a truly interesting game. There are many interactive parts and it's really fun to put the portal together. The only thing I didn't like was that that many of the pieces seem to be specifically for use with this set unlike the non-themed LEGO sets. Also, certain aspects of the layout could only be made in accordance with the instructions. This cuts down on creativity a little bit but not on the fun. Despite this my godson and I had a great time putting this together.I recommend this set for children of all ages."],["We bought this for our 9 year old for Christmas and he LOVED it!  It was at the top of his list, but we hesitated because we could only find it in the stores for over $100.  We found it on Amazon way cheaper and bought it.He enjoyed putting it together and we liked that it took him awhile to do it . . . versus having it done in 30 minutes.

As soon as the package was delievered, my daughter took it, and she had so much fun with it. First of all, as the description says, this is a Lego set with more than 1,000 pieces (to be exact, 1,007 pieces). However, the pieces are packed in 9 separate bags, so my daughter was not too overwhelmed by the number of the pieces. Although the product description says it takes approximately 3.5 hours to build it, my daughter spent almost 2 weeks. She does not spend many hours every day, though. The 7 mini figures (they call it the deep sea crews and the guardians) were really cute, and my daughter loved to play with these. There are some neat moving parts in the set, and I even had some fun playing with it. And the finished set is not small (18 inch wide and 12 inch tall).My daughter had a little bit of a hard time to build it, however, the overall difficulty did not seem too high. As a matter of fact, I have never seen my daughter concentrate that much while she was building The Lego Portal of Atlantis 8078. Now The Lego Portal of Atlantis 8078 sits on the floor of our living room, and it does not look bad at all. This was our first big Lego set, and we are very impressed.

The directions are easy to follow, walking the child step by step as they set up the gameboard. This one is more like an extended version of tick-tack-toe, with enough variety to keep the older kids entertained. The legos are a standard size, so the pieces can be used with an existing collection if you wish, although we tend to keep each game stored in the original box. As the game encourages kids to design their own version, I think there's a lot of variability to keep interest fresh as the child ages.

It makes the game more interesting than a regular whatever-number-in-a-row game, and it is still easy enough for a 5 year old to grasp and think about.  Building the game isn't particularly challenging or interesting, and the pieces aren't all that interesting in the event that you don't like the game and are just keeping it for the pieces - there is the spider, a couple of flames, and a bunch of ghoulish heads."],["Quite a simple game but with enough variables to be fun and take a while (but not too long) to get a winner.

Very happy with this purchase.  He loves setting up the board since they are legos after all and this game has quickly become a staple in our family game night.  The concept of it kind of reminds me of Tic-tac-toe or Connect 4 because you have to have four monsters in a row to win but the other players have to try to block you so you don't get four in a row.

It is terrific because your child needs to put it together before (s)he can play it.  You even put the die together!  Play is a bit like tic-tac-doe, except you can move your pieces around and the white ghosts are \"wild.\"  The board tends to fall apart, so we reinforced it with some long, rectangular LEGO pieces we had around.

Life surprises us like that as we struggle to do our best. We think things will end up one way, and oftentimes, unplanned, they end up completely differently, but even better than expected. He got me away from the computer time and again until I finally ditched any thoughts of dinner, called the pizza delivery guy, and set to work to create a new playworld for my son.My almost six-year-old son took the lead, enthralled by the little pieces and sometimes challenged by the instructions. Nonetheless, he independently worked on the rescue vehicle while my daughter and I tackled the fire truck. At first, ee mumbled under this breath that he wasn't good at building things. Oh yeah? LEGO Fire Station proved he could. It makes me cry to think how much of a boost he got in his confidence by completing such an elaborate building in one day.My husband put together the station, then we moved it all to the family room for more fun the next day. Admittedly, the fire station requires adult supervision. I was even challenged at times to find all the right pieces. Luckily, the bags are clearly numbered, as well as the instruction booklets. Just be sure to keep them handy in case your child decides to play 'car crash' with the fire truck like ours did!With other toys that require assembly, my kids seems excited by putting it together, then leave the toy unnoticed thereafter. The LEGO Fire Station has elicited a different reaction. They love the assembly AND playing with it, too. In fact, we had to convince our son to go to a playdate he has been anticipating for months today, simply because he did not want to part with his new toy. I'm certain he's going to want the other LEGO CITY toys, too. As I eye my son's room, I figure we can always have a yard sale or, more drastically, move to a bigger house.

The magnet in there works well to keep it sealed and the little engravings on it are nice. Also, the lid opens and closes with ease unlike some other flip boxes I've seen and doesn't block your access to the cards inside.My only issue with it is when you do get 100 cards in there, for EDH style deck or decks with sideboards, you basically have to flip it upside down to pour all the cards out instead of being able to reach inside and grab them.Other than that and it being a little pricier than the standard plastic ultra pro deck boxes, this box is a pretty legit way to store some of your nicer decks."],["Bought this on Amazon because I have seen it in local stores selling for twice to three times what I got on here for.

Maybe being a newb is going to come back to bite me on this review, but I'm not sure why the extra space is provided. Dice? Very small pencil? Seems odd.

It may take a slight bit more effort to get the cards in the CPS, but once they're in, you shouldn't have to worry about your cards slipping out once they're in. As with all CP, There is a big added bulk. My 72 card deck looks like i'm playing a 150 card deck, This only a small price to pay for protection.The design on the back is actually quite cool. its one of the only card protectors I've seen that matches the back of the original card.

The overall colors are darker than the cards, The &#34;MAGIC&#34; logo is yellow instead of blue, and there is no &#34;DECKMASTERS&#34; sign. The small front silver holographic circle has been moved so that you can still see the Power/Toughness clearly. The inside of the CP is black, so it seamlessly blends in with the black borders of the card.Overall, These are great Card Protectors. Perfect for die-hard Magic fans who want Ultra-Pro protection but would like the simplicity of the design on the back of the card. Its definitely a 9.5/10, and well worth the $8.60 I spent.

BUT BE CAUTIONED:I got the box in an extremely beat up, reused box. I don't mind reused boxes, but the tape wasn't even on correctly and when I first saw the box I actually thought someone had opened beforehand. There was no packing popcorn, the box was in horrible condition, AND I had a small dent on the corner of the actual box.The Return to Ravinca box actually comes with some really nice land dividers. They're solid plastic so now I know I can sort through all of my cards correctly and have them all in one box. I read another review that it only holds about 1,800 cards, but I'm pretty sure I have no where near that many.The top of the box is one that slides on and off, there's no flap or anything so you should be careful to hold it while moving it. It's made out of pretty thick cardboard so I know it will be able to survive some bumps and bruises along the way. It also comes with stickers that have the mana symbols along with the stickers with text labels with what kind of card, color, etc. I'm pretty sure I'm not going to use the stickers, but they're pretty handy to have.Overall, I'm really satisfied with the product, it's the shipping that was completely horrid. It's a good gift to get, and especially with the cards I got and pulled, the box pretty much paid for itself and the shipping."],["My boyfriend has more magic cards then one person should need, so the gift box was nice for storage as well as providing some cards. He and I are both very pleased! :)"],["Love this box. It allows me to transport the decks and cards that I use frequently safely and it's construction is solid."],["My best friend recently bought this gift box set, and as we are both heavy MTG players, I thought i should write a review on the product.Firstly, the contents. As other reviews stated, the set contains 4 RtR booster packs(random contents) as well as the stickers, dividers, and the box. In my opinion the stickers aren't that useful. It has stickers for the RtR guilds, and it contains stickers for the MTG sets going back quite a ways. These could be used just as stickers, or to put on the plastic dividers to distinguish what sets you have organized.As for the box, it is about the size of three fat pack boxes connected together. It seems like it is made of the same material, very sturdy. My personal opinion is that the box is too wide to be practical, because unlike fat pack boxes, you cannot practically stack it vertically, unless you put it on it's side.One thing I should point out. The cards that came with the set, the ones not from the booster packs, seem to be made of a different material than regular cards are. they seem to be more shiny and they almost feel like they are less sturdy card stock. If you compare a card from the set to a card from say a booster pack, with exactly the same artwork, the one from the set almost looks like it is lighter in color or like it has a glossy dust on it that doesn't come off. This may not be an issue, especially since the different cards are only commons, uncommons, and lands, however for a collector it might be a point of interest.Everything else about the set seems normal and of a very good quality. Hope this helps!!"],["I bought as a christmas present and my cousins were very happy, from what I could tell...since i didn't get any weird looks, or frowns...only smiles!"],["Prior to picking up this box, I had been carrying two or three fat pack boxes with me to my local game store when participating in tournaments and events.  Now I have one box that is big enough to carry multiple decks (for me, a couple of Standard, a couple of Modern, and a Commander/EDH deck)--all sleeved-- and still have plenty of room for my dice bag, my play mat (folded in half length-wise, and rolled), spare land, extra sleeves, and (of course) room for any additional packs or cards I might pick up.  You can keep it flat, or stand it on end, allowing it to be kept on a bookshelf.In addition, it is simply a beautiful box. Some might view it solely as a collector's item, but I use mine regularly.  When I first got it, there were many \"oohs\" and \"ahhs\" from other players, who were not aware of its release.  The main box uses a sturdy cardboard/paperboard, with a glossy finish.  It's not going to stand up to the abuses of a toddler, but, with care, it should last me many years.  I especially like the fact that the box lid lifts off--there's no hinge edge that will crack or distort over time.The dividers in the box are not only great-looking, but they are also designed for the long-term, made out of sturdy plastic.  The attached label sheet provides many options for use in conjunction with those dividers, but I also found the rest of them useful for tagging my many other storage boxes.Looking at the price (MSRP $19.99 at the time of release), you are getting four booster packs (MSRP $3.99 each, or $15.96) plus the box, dividers, labels, and the alternate-art Dreg Mangler card, all for the cost of five boosters.  So, basically, you get the box and all the bonus items for slightly less than the cost of an additional pack--it's an exceptional value!I picked up one for myself, and three more for my sons, who also play Magic: the Gathering.  I'm thinking about picking up another one, to put away for its collector's value.If you play, even casually, I strongly recommend picking one up.  It's a great way to keep your collection (or part of it!)."],["Gave to my grandson who declared it a very nice set!

I like that it came with card separators as well, which makes organizing my collection easier. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the box is not the sturdiest. It did not take long for the top part of the box's sides to rip, causing it to easily fall off. Tape fixed it up just fine, but this box is great for storage until my collection grows or I get something a little sturdier. I recommend this to anyone with a smaller collection who wants a convenient storage case/box."],["the item came very quickly and was exactly as described. i am happy with this purchase and it is great for all the cards i have to store."],["I know it's subjective about how many cards this box holds but I ordered several and I tested it last night when the first one arrived.It holds 600 cards per column/aisle.  I put the cards in piles of 100 and then inserted them until I couldn't fit anymore.  The cards are in there full but not stuffed to where I'd damage them getting them out (for example, if they're in there so tight that I have to use my fingernail to get some traction and pull them out then the edges sometimes get chafed and turn white).For what you get and the durability and art, I think it's worth it.  I'm just telling people because this seems to be in high demand, short supply and you might want to take into consideration how many you order based on 1,800 cards per box, not 2,000.:)"],["Very nice product for organizing cards an such. I have no qualms except I found it at Walmart for the same price but no shipping. Womp womp. I highly doubt that's the case anymore though.

The Holiday Box gives you 4 (so $15 in boosters) and costs $20. However it also includes a really cool alternate art Dreg Mangler, lands, high quality card storage dividers with stickers to mark them and a nice box to hold them all in. The box is probably my favorite part to be honest. Its nicely sized (not to big, not to small) and holds a really good amount of cards (standard boxes hold like 750-1000 cards and dont come with dividers).The only thing that I have to say thats even somewhat negative about this whole thing is that you can't place the same amount of cards as they show in the picture and still have the lid close perfectly. The reason being is that the dividers are slightly to tall to stand totally upright for the lid to fit on exactly right. I guess you could trim the bottom of the dividers to solve that problem though.The alternate Dreg Magler art for those interested: [...]"],["The actually card box came pretty beat up.

Definitely a great buy for the original price but the current prices not so much."],["I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday recently. Where we live, booster packs are roughly $4 each, so you're not getting a huge discount on that front. But considering everything that the package comes with, it's well worth the money. The box is sturdy and holds quite a few cards, and the graphics are well done. The real prize is the dividers, which are illustrated with bright and beautiful pictures. My boyfriend is in love with it, so it was definitely a good purchase!"],["I got this for my son, who is an avid gamer and started a MTG club at school.  He really liked the huge box (which still fits in his backpack), and the dividers.  He even got a couple of nice cards in the booster packs.  The only reason I knocked off a star is for the price -- it's selling now for much more than I paid.  Basically, you've got $16 worth of booster packs, a sturdy, printed cardboard box worth about $10, and maybe $5 worth of stickers and dividers.  Compare that to the asking price before buying."],["Bought this for myself because, what the heck, it's the holiday seasons and I needed a box for my growing collection. The box itself is quite sturdy. If you've seen or owned a fat pack box, I reckon the construction material for this box is the same as the fat pack boxes.As for the price, you're basically paying $4 for the box, 6 VERY nice and sturdy thick plastic dividers (thicker than credit cards!) with great RtR Lands art, some stickers, and the alternate-art foil Dreg Mangler. I think this is a really good deal, especially if you need a box for your collection anyway. I've also heard that game and comic book stores are only getting limited supplies of these, so these Holiday Gift Boxes may become rare soon in the future - all the more reason for getting one while they're around at base (or close to) price.The 4 RtR booster packs that come in the box are basically at MSRP price of $4 each. As with any booster packs, they're random. You'll get good pulls some times, and you'll get less-than-desirable pulls most of the time. I happened to be lucky with the packs in my Holiday Gift Box: Rakdos Lord of Riots, Chromatic Lantern, Blood Crypt, and a foil Mizzium Mortars. The current going prices for these 4 in total already exceed what I paid for the Holiday Gift Box!

Costing only a few dollars more than the packs that come with it, the dividers and stickers provided offer very thorough organization options.

The problem was that it fell apart when he used it."],["I ordered two of these boxes (a blue and a black) for EDH/Commander decks.  The description on the box (packaging) states that it will hold 100 CCG cards in ultra pro sleeves.  The box will really hold about 90 sleeved cards easily.  Even with bending them a little I couldn't fit all 100 in.  I am using ultra pro sleeves (the newer, smaller/thinner ones) so as far as I can tell I am using it as advertised.  Now the packaging does say CCG cards not MTG, but there are MTG logos on the box.Another reviewer mentioned that the boxes are too wide and your cards can shift back and forth.  Even with me cramming in about 95 cards (the most I could fit in there) there was still half an inch or so of room on the sides.  If I shook the box at all you could hear the cards knocking around even when crammed in like they were.  I'm not sure what the purpose of the width is.  The box design is such that you can only load cards in one way so you couldn't fit a sideboard (non EDH decks) in the extra space or anything like that.The deck I used is still in progress and I only play with a group of friends so I do have a few proxies in place.  It is possible that this changed the thickness of the cards enough to not be able to fit 100 cards in the box.  However, if you have any altered or painted cards (like some EDH players prefer) I don't think there is enough room in the box to accommodate.As a side note the deck I tried slotting into this deck box easily fits into the basic black plastic flip top Ultra Pro deck boxes.  So same company, same advertised capacity, but completely different results.All in all I think the boxes are pretty nice.  I like how the lid is hinged (opens really wide).  The magnet is sewn in/hidden so I don't think it will break easily.  The magnet grips easily and pretty firmly so I think the boxes close securely.  The boxes look nice and all the logos are formed correctly/are easy to read.  The boxes just don't fit a 100 card deck which is the only reason I bought them.Also when I mention that the box doesn't work as advertised that doesn't imply the seller was at fault.  Their description matched the claims on the packaging.  I think Ultra Pro produced a product that doesn't live up to their claims."],["This deck box is great. At only 10-15 dollars ,depending on the retailer, and being made of a soft leatherette material on the outside with the magnetic flip lid I can't think of a better deal. While not being made of real leather I would argue that the material they chose maintains the same quality and durability but kept the cost down. The inner material is a soft linen which is a nice touch and adds to the box's overall feel of a quality product. It is a large box, it fits around 100-110 sleeved cards in, not sure how many it holds if they aren't sleeved but I'd wager around 150. Yes I know there are cheaper deck boxes out there but they are usually made of a thin plastic material. They also usually bends easily and really only provides superficial protection to your cards. If you want the best in deck protection and don't mind spending a little more then this is the deck box for you."],["I bought this along with the other deck boxes of the same design (in every color) for my husband who collects magic cards and he LOVED them- these are a great gift for the nerd in your life- one of those things they always think about getting and wanting but might never buy for themselves.

My boyfriend says the stitching has not unraveled thus far and seems to be holding up nicely -- he's a bit hard on things, so if it can withstand his use, it has to be halfway decent.Even though the stitching is much to be desired, I still would recommend this purchase.

She says she is going to display it on her dresser for all her friends to see.  It is a very beautiful doll."],["I'd like to start my review by pointing out, for those who don't know, that this barbie is a collector barbie. Collector barbies aren't really designed to be played with - their clothes are taped (discreetly) on, and most accessories are sewed in. Not to mention the value plummets as soon as it's removed from the box. As such, this is not a toy I'd recommend to get your little girl.I happen to be an adult woman who never \"grew out\" of loving barbie. As soon as I saw this doll online I wanted her. She is just as beautiful as, if not more than, her picture. As a collector, I'm horrible: I take them out of the box. This doll was no exception, but unlike some of my others I am quite sure I will never change her clothes. Her wings are attached to her dress so I could if I wanted to (the tape can be removed with some effort and caution,) but she looks divine as she is. As play goes, she'll be given a largely npc guardian angel role. In the meantime her beauty inspired me to set her on a shelf instead of in a box between uses. A mirror at the back truly places her as the lovely focal point of my room.Getting her out of the box is a bit of a challenge. However it can be done with no damage to the doll or her clothes if you're very careful. Her shoes are not attached so you may wish to remove them for this process, as they may fall off and get lost. Her front ringlets are attached to her arms and her dress. Her halo is attached to the hair that is swept back. As pointed out, her wings are sewn to her dress and her dress to her by double sided tape. All are removable with great care and minimal damage (tape will inevitably leave sticky.) She has \"pearl\" earrings, gold lid shadow, brown outer shadow, and white glitter brow-bone shadow. Her eyes themselves are yellow-green with a blue outer ring ringed again by long lashes like in a lengthening mascara ad. Her lips are broad and a delicate shimmery pink; her nails about the same shade without the shimmery. Her blush is very subtle. Her face overall reminds me a little of Angelina Jolie, but better. The tone of her skin with her hair makes her positively glow like a reflection of sunshine. Ringlets will easily lose their curl if touched too much. Her stand is white and like any other.In short: this doll is built for decoration, not play. Recommended for older children and adults who will preserve her beauty. A must-have for serious collectors. Too beautiful to hide in storage. Use care if you take her out of the box. With caution, can be made to play with for younger children if you don't mind the potential mauling of her perfection at a price 3-4x a normal barbie."],["I used this Barbie as the top of my daughters 6 year old birthday cake.  She wanted \"angels\" as her theme.  The picture they have here does not do this doll justice.  The doll is absolutely beautiful.  We placed it on a stand and had to glue it to make it stand without falling.  She played with it for several days then we placed it back on the stand and put up on the shelf.  It looks somewhat magical.  Very pretty and was a perfect top for our cake."],["Wonderful collectors barbie.very elegant.it is a must have.bought it for my grandaughter in California for Christmas.This will be her first collectible."],["She is a lovely doll.  However, you should be aware of a couple of things once you take her from the box:1) Her hair is a rat's nest mess in the back.2) The wings are delicate and feathers fall out if you move her around at all.3) The dress is very flat out of the box - it looks puffy in the box on display but when you take it out, there's no volume at all.4) The crown is just a disk sewn into her hair.  It isn't really a crown or a halo.That said, the dress design is quite lovely and she looks very beautiful on display from the front.  Not very attractive from the side/back, though. You have to handle her gently."],["Love LOVE love the wings ~ This is a great Angel Barbie.  Her outfit is a lovely shade of blue and her face is angelic.  She has the best wings of the angel barbies I've seen / collected so far.  I highly recommend this angel barbie."],["A great collectors doll, very elegant dress.  Although the belt is made with pretty cheap plastic. But the crown has very detailed designs.  The wings are not very durable if you drop it about 5-10 times the wings will probably come off.

The Secret Creepers are a toy line for recording and passing messages. Cute ideas in the 80s and 90s, but in this date and age of cell phones and text messaging, the toyline comes off a little dated or retro, depending on how you view it. The animals, which make up the Secret Creepers line are much large than the versions that come with the dolls. The scale is completely off and so mixing the core doll line with the Secret Creepers line just looks weird and noticeably off.I bring this up because it's important to note that the Crypt playset is only for use with the Secret Creepers. The previous animals will either not fit or just look really out place with this set. That means to really get any use out of the Crypt, you're going to have to invest heavily in the Secret Creepers line and like myself. This is neither bad, nor good - simply a fact that means you'll ant two or three other Secret Creeper figures besides the one that comes in this set. Otherwise it will look pretty barren. Even the packaging it comes in has three extra SC cutouts in paper form to keep it from looking empty.The set itself is well made. it's sturdy and very colourful, which should make kids happy. It also comes with a Crescent the kitten figure. Unlike other Secret Creepers which store and share short messages, Crescent is a motion activated toy, which is meant to guard the other figures. So if someone broke into your room to read your other SC figures' messages, Crescent would go off and scare them away or alert you. Unfortunately the toy is neither very scary or loud. It's a cute kitten figure, but it also lacks any joints. It a solid piece of plastic meaning it will only ever hold the one pose.All in all, the Secret Creepers Crypt is a bust if you're a Monster High fan. it's not compatible with the majority of MH figures and the SC line is a bit lame, definitely out of date and overpriced for what you get. That said, if you ARE a fan of the Secret Creepers line (We won't judge you), then you might as well splurge on this playset as Crescent is the best looking of the figures and this gives you a way to display them."],["I asked my daughter what rating she'd give this toy, and she jumped in the air and said, &#34;Five!&#34;She says what she loves about it is:~The size--it's not too big, not too small.~You can move a lot of the things on the set.~All the compartments, and specifically the secret drawer.~One of the pets (Crescent) comes with it, and she hisses when she senses movement and there is a button to make her meow.~Each place for a pet is specifically designed for that pet.Negatives:~The instructions are hard to understand.~The key it comes with is a little flimsy.~Flip side of each place being designed for each pet: you can't put a pet in whichever space you'd like.I would say I agree with her assessment. I thought the size was plenty big to play with along with her dolls, but not overly big. It seems well-made and sturdy overall. Lots of different things to do with the set. And the instructions are a little strange in places, but we got it all figured out pretty quickly. She's totally enjoyed playing with this since we got it!"],["It was only a matter of time before a new kind of Monster High toy accessory came out. Over the last couple of years we've seen costumes, stuffed animals, purses, makeup kits and more, but now we're moving on to another toy within the toy line- Secret Creepers! I hadn't even seen any of the toys until after we got this crypt, which is kind of like a mini-dollhouse with how much you can put on it.There are a lot of things to talk about here. The bottom line is that you're getting quite a bit for your money. I was pleasantly surprised at just how much can go with this set! Tons of space for the different pets, both new Secret Creepers and the original ones that come with the MH dolls. Details on certain parts like webs and hearts on the back of the spider are a nice touch, and they even have a background that goes perfectly with Jane Boolittle. There's a pink key that's made up of a chain and fish bones. You can use this to open the main crypt, making for a dramatic effect where the gate slowly comes down. Inside, you can store a few pets or whatever you want; it's a fairly large compartment. A green compact case is included and it also acts as a kind of stool for one of the pets to sit on when it's not being used. Again, I was surprised at how big this was when opened. After being disappointed with the lack of space in a few MH doll accessories like folders and bags (the ones that come with the dolls), this was a nice step up. The coolest part of the whole crypt however, has got to be the red coffin couch. Under the cushion there's a little drawer that comes out and you can put something in it. But with the flick of a switch on the back, it hides what you put in there. It's a very neat trick and reminds me of a Beetlejuice toy I had in the early 90s.The play set comes with one pet- Crescent the cat, who acts as a guard for the dog house/crypt, growling if anyone walks within 5 feet of it. It's nice to include a figure when they could have just sold the set on its own for the same price. 3 LR44 batteries are included, so you're ready to go right out of the box.For about the price of a Monster High doll, you're getting a pretty cool play set for the new pets, though it goes with the girls and boys just as well too. Any Monster High fan will love this. Just be prepared to watch the dollars disappear as you get more and more pets."],["My daughters both enjoy playing with Monster High dolls and products.  I was excited to see a new line of Monster High toys that focus on the pets.  With this set you pretty much get one cat with a motion sensor and a little set up that you can lock away a small little treasure.  My daughters thought this was awesome and played with it for about 20 minutes.  Ever since it's been sitting on the toy bin untouched.  It's not a stand alone toy at all."],["It's Monster High themed, so you have all the skulls and typical colors, but once we assembled the set, there wasn't much to it. There is a place you can hide things, and that's about it.  My daughter played with it one time, the day it arrived, but hasn't given it any play time since then.  I'm sure it will be donated soon with other toys that no longer interest her."],["This product is very bright, fun, and full of color.  It seems to be made of sturdy plastic with lots of hidden nooks and cranny's to &#34;hide secret stuff.&#34;I know it seems obvious now, but I didn't pay attention at first to the fact that the whole point of this crypt is for the monster high dolls PETS to play on &#34;while the monster high girls are at school.&#34;  It includes a cat, who when detecting motion, really GROWLS!!.  It also includes some animal cut outs---but will be much more fun for kiddos who have 5 or 6 other pets to play with.  It does have room for them all.Overall, I think you get a fun sturdy product for the price.  (With that said, I think a lower price point for this item would increase it's appeal even more.)"],["This creeper crypt was a real hit with my niece who loves the Monster High Dolls. This is like &#34;Littlest Pet Shop&#34; in Monster  form. The only problem is you have to buy all the creeper pets separately to go with it. It only comes with Crescent Cat which has a motion detected feature that makes it scream when anyone gets near. The other creepers are hard to find and a little pricey for what you get at 6.99 and up. I think that the creeper pets are not that creepy and could have been designed better. In my opinion, they are cheap looking and not all that interesting. The crypt play set is cool on its own, just don't like the selection of creeper pets."],["As I have mentioned in previous reviews we have a young lady who is head over heels in Monster High and Ever After dolls.  They each have a special place in her room (which is starting to become overrun by the collections). The Secret Creepers Crypt is one of the neatest accessory pieces Mattel has come up with for these dolls.Our girl finds little things (figurines, plastic pet figures, keys to her diaries, etc) to hide in the &#34;ultra-secret&#34; areas.  We, of course, are allowed to hunt for them, but have never been able to locate anything!  HA!  She has been convinced by our lack of success in hunting that we should remove our money from the bank and hide it in this toy!  Maybe she truly thinks it will be safe there, and maybe she just wants all our money!  In all respects, this a good addition to your collection of Monster High gear.Recommended as a top notch gift idea"],["I have a ten year old Monster High fan in my household. She loved the theming and design of this playset but hasn't used it very much. After opening it and playing with her friends one afternoon she put it on the shelf and hasn't done much with it. She likes looking at it and occasionally moving the animals around but she doesn't play with it like some of her other MH sets. It's nicely themed and arrives mostly assembled. The key is a little flimsy but hasn't broken and I appreciate that it came with the batteries. I think giving this with at least one more pet would be better then just the cat alone."],["Now she can start a whole new collection of secret keeping versions of Monster High characters' pets, which either keep secrets electronically: Secret Creepers or on paper: Secret Critters.  What you get in this product is basically a play set/display stand for the Secret Creepers and Critters sold separately, but to Mattel's credit there is more to it than that.Paper secrets can be rolled up and stored in the columns underneath the gargoyles, things (or a Creeper or a Critter) can be locked up in the doghouse, and the key can be hidden in the Magic Drawer in the coffin-like chaise lounge.  The key can also be used as the handle for the clip on compact, or said compact can be opened up as a perch for theMonster High Secret Critters Hisette Figure.  The fish tank can hold theMonster High Secret Critters Neptuna Figure, and there are perches for at least four more Creepers or Critters.As I've come to expect from the Monster High toy line, the whole thing is beautifully and sturdily made, but a basic design flaw cost it a star.  The figure that comes with it is Crescent the Cat, which has a motion sensor in her chest that when turned on causes her to hiss and snarl in response to motion within five feet of her front.  The defect?\"Note: The product is equipped with an automatic shut-off feature that helps preserve battery life.\"because that's what you want an alarm to do: shut off if nothing triggers it right away...."],["This is a cute little Monster High spin off, I must admit!  This Secret Creepers Crypt works with the new Secret Creepers, large scale pets that have secret keeping capabilities.  This colorful playset has a place for all the pets currently on the market.  It comes with Clawdeen's cat.  While this cat doesn't record secrets, it has a neat trick to it.  It is a motion detector.  Once turned on, if it senses motion, the cat makes makes an annoying screech!  Honestly, the cat's howl?  I can't stand it.  Sorry.  It's just not a nice sound.This set is sturdy, full of color and full of hiding spots.  The key hiding place in this set is the chaise lounge, that opens with a key and then 'mysteriously' hides your treasure upon closing it.  (Think of the magic tricks that include trick boxes!)  There are a few elements, too, including the white door, that open making them perfect for hiding your secrets!Overall, this is a cute set.  For me, it's more of a display piece, but for kids?  It totally see them playing with this!"],["My 9 yo loves Monster High (we have the high school and mansion set and a myriad of dolls), so I thought this would be a hit. However, with just one animal (the cat) it is a little boring. This set really is not compatible with the other dolls and animals - just the secrete creepers. The set is made of plastic and does not really have many features aside from hiding places, the locking dog house and drawer under the chaise. Otherwise the main point seems to be a place to put the other secret creepers pets (e.g. fish bowl, perch). The cat is hard plastic with no moving parts and is pretty loud (maybe on carpet it would be softer?) - my daughter actually found it annoying after a while. I think this would be a 4/5 if we have other pets, but we do not. For this reason, I am not sure this would make a great gift (e.g. birthday present) unless you are giving it with another pet or know that the child already has them."],["With Monster High introducing the new Secret Creeper Pets, my daughter was all too thrilled to get this set!  It was super easy to pop together (though staying together is another story), the accessories are adorable and it includes a Cat to play with.  What's disappointing is that the Cat isn't one of the Secret Creepers, even though it comes along with the playset; there's a whole line of new pets that do cool things and keep secrets.  It would have been nice if one of those had been included or if the Cat had Secret Creeping abilities also.  Ella was frustrated with that.  Aside from this, she loves the set and it's made a great addition to all her Monster High collection!"],["If you liked Charles Addams as a kid, or you have a child over 6 who is a little bit \"goth\", then this toy is for your family!I have four Monster High dolls (... problem with the fact that I am 62 years old?), and before this arrived, they were all piled up on a toy sofa which is really a jewelry box. Now I have a really fun way to play with them! I can pose them and display them for my photoshoots, which is [supposedly] why I collect dolls at my age. I give photography as the reason I collect dolls.You would be amazed, actually, at the number of adult doll collectors in this country. And world wide.Monster High dolls are tons of fun because they are a bit off beat, and also because they can be posed. Their hands, arms and legs bend, almost like ball-jointed dolls.The cat in this crypt has a sound sensor so that it howls when something passes by. It remind me of the Addams family, once again! Cute! Great start for your MH critter collection.If you know a child who collects Monster High dolls --get this as a special present. Make sure however that this hobby is already well established if this is not for you or a child in your own family, for two reasons:1) the kid might not like Monster Highand2) definitely don't buy it as an introduction to Monster High unless you also plan to give the child one of the dolls to go along with it.It would be like giving a diorama or doll house and no doll!Otherwise , 5 star fun for ages 6 to ...um....62!!!thanks, jean"],["This is a really cute set. The main attraction for us is the couch, which has a secret storage drawer underneath-- like a little magic trick. You can use it to store the key to the doghouse (uh... cathouse, really), or anything else of your choosing... coins, crystals, notes, etc.There's not a whole lot to it, and yet it's fun and well-made. There are some hiding spots and perches for the pets, plus a clothesline for the other pets' keys. The motion sensor on the cat works well, but freaked us out, so we turned it off and just press the button to hear her purr instead of growl.About the only thing that's not particularly well made is the key that comes with this. It's bendy, and I worry that it could eventually break. Aside from that, we love the set and think it's a great idea to have a special place for the pets to hang out."],["My duaghter is a huge MH fan.  She has been enjoying this set.  I find that most MH stuff isn't made that well (the house), but this set is pretty good.  She has been enjoying it.  Colors are bright and it works well.

This was another piece to add - a place for the familiars of the characters to play.  So, it gets 4 stars for enjoyment, but I'm going to dock a star back down to 3 because at roughly $20, it seems a little pricey for what you actually get.

In other words, is it worth about $15 - $20to add this, or is it just another box of plastic bits and pieces that will get consumed, scattered, lost and ignored?I think this one works.  The crypt, bed, and cage all make for fun places to put the dolls and their accessoriesand pets.

What started as a collection for my then 1-year-old has brewed into a closet stuffed full of Monster High dolls and toys. But of late I'm feeling pretty disenchanted over the whole thing. The dolls have branched into so many incarnations and introduced so many new characters and now they're coming up with items like this...This isn't for the dolls. Oh no, this is for a new line of figures called Secret Creepers. Basically larger versions of the various ghouls' pets. It comes with Crescent but you've got to shell out $9-$15 for each of the others depending on where you find them. The Secret Creepers have various ways of either recording audio or hiding written messages. They are really cute but pretty limited. Like the set that uses hot and cold water to change colors I think this one lacks the long-term fun factors that make it recommendation worthy.This playset is a bit pricey for what it is and I honestly just do not think it's worth paying full price for if it's going to be for a child. Now, as a collector, you might want to pick these up and this set in particular. I think they will be difficult to find in pristine condition later. Otherwise, for both kids and collectors I'd recommend something else like the Die-ner or Lagoona's Shower playsets. Much cuter and with more play options."],["I got this for my niece (solidly in the 6-12 age range for the product). She is super into the Monster High stuff.

I like this set. I have a few of the pets and I can always get more. The couch with the hidden key drawer is really cool. Flip the switch, no key! Flip it again, there's the key! I can put two of my secret scrolls in the columns so no one knows where they are.This set comes with a cat that's kind of creepy. I like it when it purrs, but when I move around, the cat growls and spits at me and I don't like that very much. I think I'll keep the cat off when I play with this.\"My thoughts:If you know someone who collects Monster High Secret Keeper toys, this playset will make an excellent gift. The fishbone key should be held near the fish's tail when using the key, that way it won't snap or bend out of shape. The doghouse door lock is a little stiff, so be careful when you open that.I must agree, the yowling and spitting noises the cat makes are pretty unnerving.

She is especially fond of this set because she, and nearly every other 8 year old girl, adores cats. OMG this cat meows!!!

Great toy."],["I had the same problem as a couple people in that my boy really likes this toy but after a little while the blades stopped spinning with the trigger. I took the entire thing apart and here is what I found out.  The blade spinning trigger is connected to a plastic bar which has gear teeth on the side end.  The teeth stick into a gear box.  Inside the gear box another smaller gear box pivots into engagement with the rotor(blades) hub.  When the trigger is released, the smaller pivoting gearbox can move out of engagement with the hub, allowing you to pull the trigger and spin the blades again.  This unit seems to be fairly durable and was not the problem with the blades not spinning.  What was causing the blades not to spin is this:  The hub(center) of the blades is designed to lift out of engagement with the gearbox when the blades are folded.  This appears to be so the blades and gearbox don't break when the trigger is pulled when the helicopter is in the box.  Once you take it out of the box and align the five blades open, the hub snaps down flat and the blades hub gear engages, allowing the trigger to work.  End of gearhead comments.  ************ S u m m a r y  -  If you are having problems with the trigger not spinning the blades, make sure the blades are opened and evenly spaced.  This will mean the three big black hub disks at the center of the blades are all laying flat together with no spaces between them.  This will allow the gear to engage.  If it feels like the blades are going to break trying to align them at first you may want to grasp the sides of the hub disks and pull up when aligning the blades as this will make it much easier to line them up properly and the hub spring will pull them back together as soon as you let go of the hub.  Hope this helps to put more helicopters back in action."],["I have to admit, the size of this toy was a little bigger than what i thought it would be. The outer material is very robust and strong, bought this for my 3 year old nephew who loves it. Great handy storage space inside the chopper for keeping smaller cars, etc.. Cool Blue color.Its already been dropped and flung against a wall many times by my nephew, inspite of which, its still not entirely broken, which considering my nephew's reputation, is actually a good record and test of durability of this product!! :)Nice fun toy for children, makes for a good gift toy to give."]],"title":"Disney Pixar Cars Dinoco Helicopter","total_reviews":19,"sentiment":0.8816368421,"label":"positive","best_review":["I bought this toy for my Grandson's third birthday and he absolutely loves it.

They're not as stylized or disproportionate as the Power Attack Batman line or the Brave and the Bold, but they still have that very clean, simple style to them. They kind of remind me of the style of some of the DC Animated Universe films that have come out. Remember the Target exclusive Superman/ Batman: Public Enemies DC Universe Classics wave? That's kind of the vibe I'm picking up here. Batman measures in at just a hair over 6 1/4 inches tall which makes him a little shorter than DC Universe Classics, but not by too much. There's a lot of nice detail on the figure, and the clean art kind of reminds me of some renditions of Greg Capullo's Batman.I wasn't expecting much with the articulation, so I was quite pleasantly surprised. Batman features: hinged ankles, hinged knees, swivel/hinge hips, a swivel waist, swivel/hinge shoulders, swivel/hinge elbows, swivel wrists, and a ball jointed neck. That's more articulation that most DC Collectibles figures. The only joints missing from him that came standard on DC Universe Classics were the ab-hinge, thigh swivels, and bicep swivels, although this guy has more articulated elbows. Most of the joints feel really nice and tight and the quality control seems good. The range of movement is somewhat restricted on most joints, but for basic poses you should be in good shape.Batman comes with two Batarangs and a grapple gun that looks very reminiscent of the prop seen in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. This is a great accessory complement for the Dark Knight! The Batarangs have some nice miniscule details and holes on both sides which allow them to attach to the pegs on the back of Batman's utility belt (which I happen to think is a very neat feature). The grapple gun is a simple accessory, but it looks great with the figure and is just neat to have.This is a nice, simple Batman figure that should make an effective toy for kids and a nice inexpensive item for collectors who like to have different variations of Batman on their shelves."],["This was a gift and a biig hit with the grandson!  I have to look to buy more of them!"],["best action figure i bought from amazon yet.. my son loved it.. looks exctly like the picture on amazon.. nice width. wch it was 8 inch  but thats just  a minor thing"],["This is a really neat Batman figure.

Recommend to all."],["Durable toy and my nephew loves it (it stands up to his rough playing ) will definitely order more of these action figures for him from this supplier."],["it is hard to believe that The World's Greatest Detective has been around for seventy-five years. With his first introduction in the year nineteen hundred and thirty-nine, The United States of America was celebrating the 1st World Science Fiction Convention in New York while a mere few states west of that on the very same day, Theodore Roosevelt's head was being dedicated at Mount Rushmore. Just earlier that year, a little unknown company by the name of Hewlett-Packard had started up who would later take the world by storm with their wildly successful TouchPad. Nylon stockings for curious men went on sale for the first time in Wilmington, Delaware and the first Little League Baseball game was played at Williamsport, Pennsylvania. These were very exciting times.My father, being one male too many in a polygamist community, was exiled as a teenager and forced to live life on the rails finding work from town to town. Often times, during the winter months, distinguished gentlemen would hire him to clean their pools, mow their lawns or wash their cars as they smoked their long cigarettes and watched him. He never went into detail beyond that during his solo on-stage musical memoirs.On one such occasion, I recall him describing his time fishing experience with no rod or net, during a very hot summer in Washington state on a wharf during lo-tide. Having spent all his earnings on a comic book series called &#34;Detective Comics&#34; with a then unknown character called the &#34;Batman&#34;, immediately, he knew there was something very right about what he was seeing. Waiting for the tide to return so he could try and catch a fish with his tender bare hands, he would read and reread the comic book. Ahead of his time, he thought the &#34;dark&#34; and &#34;mysterious&#34; character needed a younger, brightly-colored, emotionally vulnerable assistant, or distraction from his demanding tasks.Father, the happy camper, was all too eager to be that distraction. Sadly, he knew it was just a fantasy, but he tried to fulfill that role in his daily life in one way or another as employment opportunity became available.Fast forward to today, we are treated by the DC Comics Total Heroes Batman figure. At such a surprisingly low price point, the figure offers a great deal of packaging. Enough excess to draw the attention of a fellow environmentalist. Seriously, I have not been this excited since the great actor and dreamboat Ben Affleck was announced as the next Batman.With that said, because this figure does not resemble Ben Affleck who IS now Batman, I refuse to rate it any higher than one star."],["My son (3years) loves his batman , bit smaller than the the rest of his super hero's but apart from that it's great"],["This was a great find, since they don't sell them in the stores.Would have been nice to have Batman the same size as the 10&#34;other action figures....but he din't seem to mind."],["I bought this and DC Comics Superman Action Figure for my grandson, age 3.  He hasn't put them down since they arrived.  They are well made and a great size--big enough to matter, small enough to put in a toy bag or box."],["I've seen some people complain about this figure and the Total Heroes line in general but I absolutely love this figure. His look is inspired by the New 52 comics. He has a decent amount of articulation and comes with a grapnel gun and two battarangs that can hook onto his utility belt near his lower back. The cape is actually cloth unlike some Batman figures where the cape is rigid plastic.This is a great toy for younger children and an awesome figure to put on display around your house or maybe on your desk at work. Highly recommended as a first Batman figure for kids or just an awesome collectible for fans of Batman."],["Great toy, my 2 year old loves it. Very study and durable. Looks exactly like the pic and comes with accessories"],["This figure is a surprise sleeper. The figure at first glance seems like a throwaway or a peg warmer but I decided to take a chance on this Batman and I am actually really digging it. The design is based on DC Comics New 52 re-launch which does not have the black underwear. It has a solid sleek paint job the figure also stands 6 inches. This figure includes 3 accessories which includes a small grappling gun and 2 batarangs. One hand is a solid fist and the other is a open hand that can hold a batarang or the grappling gun. The grappling gun looks alittle weird when he holds it but still is a nice accessory none the less. There are 2 pegs on the back of the belt underneath the cape which the 2 batarangs fit on nice and snug. The figure has a cloth cape which is a nice touch as well. The sculpt is a nice representation of the hero which gives off a little bit of a cartoony look but is still pretty cool. Overall I give this figure a 8.5 out of 10."],["this figure is basically a pure insult to everything Mattel and its DC team has done with the DC license over the past decade.  DC/Mattel used to ROCK, like they rocked hard and us fans ate up those rocks and they popped!!  DC Super Heroes paved the way for Dc Universe Classics and DC comic fans were thrilled for years by the amazing sculpts by the 4H-men and the wildly cool character selection and build a figures...now all the progress and momentum started to dissipate when DC Universe wave 17 came out...then wave 18 came out and that wave sucked too...fans were wondering why or how this was happening...then wave 19 was actually really cool ,and wave 20 would have been amazing had it included a pivotal accessory for the BAF which was canned in favor of repainting another Flash...so it was apparent that the decision making process at Mattel was becoming questionable, maybe people were drinking on the job? who knows...now its 2014 and Mattel has driven DCUC into the grave through extremely poor marketing practices and has turned to the way of the suit....what do I mean by that? I mean that what ever DC loving fans that were making DCSH and DCUC are clearly gone and have been replaced by people who clearly don't have a genuine DC fire burning within them....because a line like this would have NEVER been made and marketed to collectors.....now there are people online arguing that these are aimed at kids and collectors shouldn't get all wound up over them but really, did these people not watch the DC retail panel at SDCC in 2013?  they were premiering this junk to a room full of &#34;adult collectors&#34; who were supposed to be excited about it but the reaction fell really flat and within minutes the internet was polluted with more negative talk about Mattel's DC offerings...and many of these figures that some claim are aimed at &#34;kids&#34; are going to be sold on mattycollector.com, an &#34;adult collector&#34; site that so many kids use right?this total heroes line is already being labeled as &#34;total garbage&#34; by the VAST majority of the people who buy this kind of stuff.this is not a &#34;collectors toyline&#34; created by passionate DC loving people, no, this is an effort to decrease production costs in favor for larger profit margins and that's the basic story.  so if your collecting heart wants to donate money to these people who have clearly lost touch of what makes a great super articulated 6&#34; figure then please go ahead....I am personally spending all my doe on NECA, Hasbro's ML, MOTUC, and will keep my hopes up that DCUC or something EQUALLY as cool will make a return to retail!any how, save yer doe and stay the heck away from anything Total Heroes related!"],["There are small weapons that detach from his belt, so I wouldn't recommend it for small children. Mine is pretty responsible so it's been great!

Colors have stayed.  It has stood up to the wear and tear of a small child.  He loves it."],["This is NOT a DC Universe Classics figure.  A lot of people are hating on it and Mattell because it is a &#34;step backwards&#34; from DCUC.  Fewer joints & less paint, but cheaper price.  This is great figure for kids, or adults who are open to a fun figure that isn't strictly for &#34;adult collectors.&#34;  I like Batman's head sculpt (short ears, white eyes, like New 52), all the paint on mine is applied well, and he has more acticulation than expected (ball joint hips & shoulders, but no ankle - which would be nice).  I really enjoy this figure.  I got the Flash, as well, and they share the same body, except for the forearms.  Batman has a belt and cape, and some accessories (grappel gun and 2 Batarangs). Batarangs attach to the belt.  Packaging was interesting, with New 52 pictures and logo.  I found this one of the most fun figures I've bought from Mattell in a long time.  I believe they are taller and more articulated than the other 6&#34; Batman figures that have been on the market for a while, the Power Attack figures.

My 11 year old preferred to create her own patterns to bounce the balls into, compared to just using the cards that come with the game. She said some of the cards were easy but she didn't like all of them so she made up her own. My 14 year old said it's fun and she liked it as it was challenging in some areas.My hubby said it reminded him of a drinking game, so this might be popular for the young adult ages as well.To play, you bounce the ball on a hard surface to try to get it to land in a small circle in the tray in a pattern that is indicated on a card. The first person to complete the pattern wins. Two to four people can play. There are only two colors of balls."],["Bounce-Off game is a simple game where you flip over a card to show a pattern then you must try to bounce the balls correctly into the grid. Really simple game but has many laughs for everyone. As soon as I read the instructions it dawned on me... This is just like beer pong but without any beer.This game does include 1 game grid, 16 balls, and 9 challenge cards. To win the game you must collect 3 cards. Please note if you are worried about the limited number of challenge cards it really doesn't cause any issues. Our family thought that if we needed more we could make our own challenge cards but after playing the game we found that 9 was just enough for 4 players.I would definitely recommend! Great family fun game that is easy enough for some of the smaller children to play. Also if you want a little laugh check out the rules for the game."],["First off I thought this game would be bigger in size. It is more of a table top game. However it is still fun for all. Trying to bounce the balls into the box to make the design on the card does take some skill. As a family you can have fun but also if you wanted to try the game as a drinking game like you would bouncing balls into red cups, this would be that game."],["This game was a real hit with our 12 (going on 13 year old).  The first time we played, we actually played three full games in a row.  The game itself is pretty simple... use your balls to create the pattern on the card (two colors for teams of 1 or 2 people each).  - Your opponent also tries to create the same pattern simultaneously or while taking turns, depending upon how you choose to play the game.  The game is well constructed with balls that are heavier than a typical ping-pong ball.  This game can be played best with 2 or 4 players (three players works, but the team with two players on it has to rotate turns).  The game actually gets pretty competitive and while it is challenging, it's not too difficult to create the patterns.  The more you play, the better you get at it.There are nine cards with patterns on them, the patterns are pretty simple.  By day two, we scanned a card into our computer and used photoshop to build a card that included more spaces and allowed us to create bigger and more challenging patterns.  We then printed them out and laminated them for durability.  We've since been playing with our new cards and have enjoyed the game even more.  - The box in which the game is packaged is not really built to last.  You can run out of balls while playing, at which point you are supposed to take one out and re-use that ball for your turn.  If I were to redesign this game, I would put it in a more sturdy box, create more pattern cards & add more balls to the box (or maybe even another color to allow a third player to participate).  Other than that I have no complaints, it's been a big hit in our house."],["I bought this game because it sounded like fun. After getting it and playing with it - I was RIGHT!

But, loving the game as we do, we are challenging ourselves to create our own cards."],["Simple concept, ready to play without having to digest over and over the rules.  Chosen card lays out the design, e.g., an L- shape.  Players then take turns bouncing their ping-pong sized plastic balls into the tray trying to match the design.There aren't a lot of designs, but no matter, one can make up their own.  We sit fairly close to the board with our kids, and the game goes pretty fast.  Not that exciting, it's a bit mindless, but the kids play it more than we do.  I enjoy ping-pong much better."],["Not knowing exactly what this game was, we took advantage of picking this one up for our boys ages 8, 9 and 11.Let me caveat this, with the suggested ages for this product are 7 to 11 years old.The first day they opened this and started playing, there was nothing but laughter and enjoyment for more than two hours for all three who sat down to play this. They all got along (often a problem in competitive board games) and despite the fact that they didn't bother to keep score, they really liked it. We have a fairly big foyer for them to set this up, and without  parental supervision or interaction, they played peacefully and contently for a long time.And they had no problems going back to the game either. So all-and-all, for the ages posted on the box, this is a perfect game. Not sure how educational it is, but it works on hand-eye coordination and I'd say it's one of the better team-building games that we own. Certainly a great investment for the $18 price tag.While I don't have any negatives about this delightful game, the first thing that my wife said when she opened it was &#34;Did you buy Beer Pong for the kids?&#34; Admittedly this product can definitely be used for other purposes... but again - it was surprisingly amusing for the simplicity."],["The game comes with 8 cards- on each card is a pattern of 3 - 5 balls.  You bounce the balls off the floor and into the gridboard, trying to make them match the pattern on the card.  First person to make the pattern wins.I played this with my 8 year old son and 10 year old daughter.  It starts off harder than you would think!  But you can get the hang of it fairly quickly.  It gets easier and easier, even for my 8 year old.  I wish it came with more cards- I am tempted to make some up myself so we have some more challenges.Other than a lack of patterns to match, this is a pretty fun game.  It's a bit addicting trying to get the ball to bounce just right- sort of like a carnival game that you want to beat."],["It is a pretty simple game but my kids enjoyed it, however I don't think that it is a game they'll play over and over again. It was fun, and I suppose you can make it more difficult by bouncing the balls from a greater distance. Anyways, the kids liked it but I am just not sure that it is a game they'll continue to want to play. Seems study and the balls bounce nicely."],["It's fancy beer pong.  Re-playability is low, and I wasn't happy with balls flying all over my house, but the young adults liked it well enough. Maybe I'm just too old.  ;-)"],["I applaud Mattel's marketing department for trying to make this embarrassingly simple game seem ~t0t@LLy @w3s0m3~ but ultimately it is exactly what you think it is: ping pong balls and a connect four board.The concept is as follows: you draw a card with a pattern on it. You try to create the pattern by bouncing balls into the grid. The first one to land the pattern wins. Yay!As is the case when you intentionally bounce ping pong balls, they have a tendency to go everywhere. Unlike actual Connect Four, you will be spending 90% of the time chasing after the rouge balls. Expert ball bouncers may find the game slightly more rewarding if they are consistently able to keep the balls on the board.I will offer some praise to the grid itself, which does have a fairly high success rate at landing the ball into a slot. As long as you don't hit one of the separator pegs (which is very likely) the ping pong ball will land easily into place. It's also a game that is easy to learn and teaches some skills that may translate to a higher Angry Birds score.According to the box, this game allows up to 4 players. I'm assuming if you have 4 players it has to be teams of two, however, because otherwise the game would be impossible (there are only two colors of balls and some patterns require 5-balls to complete).OVERALL: This game is exactly as fun as you would expect, or probably less than you would expect. The game of throwing balls into grids is not original. I've seen the game at fairs and amusement parks plenty of times. The difference, however, is the size of the board. If the board were twice as large or even larger, it would be significantly more exciting and would reduce the likelihood of the ball going wild across the room. Ultimately Bounce Off is one of those games that will be played with for approximately 30 minutes and then hidden away in the dark corners of a closet for many years until finally being donated to the local Good Will."],["You've got to love a game that can make fun of itself.  I expected the silver sticker to boast of the parenting or other awards won by the game.  However, it simply states &#34;Winner of Absolutely No Awards. But Who Cares?&#34;  Most importantly, I enjoyed playing the game even more than I liked its packaging.The game can be played by 2 to 4 players.  It's intended for ages 7+ and that age seems appropriate.  Probably, though, 7 is at the lower end of the target age range.  Kids 9+ years old probably enjoy it the most.The game is rather simplistic and moves fast.  It's based mostly on luck but a little bit of skill is required.  To play, a player picks a card.  Each card includes a challenge.  The card has a picture of balls in a configuration that the player who chose the card tries to get.  To match the correct configuration, the player has to bounce the ball and hope it lands in the right spot.It's a fun game, good for families and children with a wide age range, and a nice addition to any game collection."],["This game has a grid and colored ping pong balls.  There are also cards ranging in difficulty.  The object of the game is to bounce your balls into the grid and be the first to form the pattern on your card.  The person to match his card three times is the winner.We had so much fun with this!  Everyone from adults to special needs children had a blast.  The balls are light and bounce easily.  Though the idea of the game is incredibly simple, it's a challenge to get the balls to bounce where you want them to.  The grid is a sturdy plastic so it'll hold up.  We did notice that when we accidentally stepped on a ball, it crushed pretty easily.  Even after crushing, it still bounces like crazy though so we can still play with it.Each round only takes a matter of minutes to complete.  The game itself can be played in under ten minutes.  The most fun part of the game is the healthy competition.  In one of our games we played teams with girls against boys.  Girls won, of course!  But we had a blast taunting each other and laughing each time someone missed the spot they were obviously shooting for.Though it's deceptively simple to play, it's incredibly difficult to master.  Once you do master it, try playing on an uneven table for an added challenge.I absolutely love this game.  It's become the most played game in our house.  I really hope that they create a 'ball replacement' pack, however, since we're a little rough on them."],["My oldest son is a big fan of the game show &#8220;Minute to Win It&#8221;, and wanted this game because it reminded him of those types of contests.  &#8220;Bounce-Off Game&#8221; is a game where two players attempt to replicate a pattern by bouncing balls into a grid.  (The game comes with 9 different pattern cards.)  The first player to make the pattern wins that card, and the first player to win three cards win.All of my children enjoyed playing this game, particularly my oldest.  Although the game isn&#8217;t deep enough to keep their attention for long, it&#8217;s fun enough that they have come back to play it multiple times.  Four stars."]],"title":"Bounce-Off Game","total_reviews":17,"sentiment":0.9456235294,"label":"positive","best_review":["It is a pretty simple game but my kids enjoyed it, however I don't think that it is a game they'll play over and over again.

So you're not having to spend 20 bucks on 1 card alone, and you get 4 packs, (I got one Plasma Storm, one Plasma Freeze, and two Plasma Blast if your looking for certain sets). I will admit to being a little sad about not having an awesome Lugia figure with the tin like the Victini tin, but all in all you are very likely to get your money's worth with this tin especially if you get good pulls.

They've finally made 6 inch Star Wars figures and this one doesn't disappoint. Han Solo is my favorite character in Star Wars so I was definitely looking forward to this, as well as Boba Fett.Nice overall sculpting and paint. The likeness to Harrison Ford is pretty good, especially the hair. He's 6 inches tall on the dot.Articulation: ball-hinge head, shoulders, elbows, waist, and hips; wrists rotate and hinge; rotation at upper thighs; double-jointed knees; hinged ankles that also roll side-to-side. Good articulation that gives you nice poses.Accessories: his brown holster belt, Stormtrooper belt with holster, interchangeable gloved and non-gloved hands, his blaster, and Stormtrooper blaster. These are great because they allow you to get different looks with him; regular outfit, escaping the Death Star with the Stormtrooper belt, and Millenium Falcon pilot with the gloved hands.Overall a great looking action figure with great articulation and accessories. Hopefully we'll get the ESB version of him in a future wave."],["Ok, that could sound as an hyperbole but once I received this guy I was pleased that he actually resembled Harrison Ford on his better days; He is one of those actors that don't translate too well into action figure form and see how well this action figure result, being the first Han Solo ever in this scale, fill me with joy.Everything with this figure feel right, the proportions, the pain, the interchangeable belts and hands, the two guns, and even the vest is removible...The articulations allow multiple poses that look pretty natural and from far, you could tell is a mini bust or something...This figure is a must buy for any collector not just from Star Wars, it will not dissapoint."],["I've been skeptical of the 6'' line of figures, especially the humans with painted skin. However, I think Hasbro really stepped up its game with this Han Solo. This figure came out wonderfully. The paint job, frequently sloppy on the 6'' line, looks pretty good. It's not perfect, and you'll probably want to inspect a few in retail stores to choose the best, but there are relatively few quality control issues. Hasbro also provided us with generous accessories, including an extra set of gloved hands and two belts and two guns. It's nice to have customization options! Overall, this could easily become my favorite of the 6'' line thus far."],["Hasbro has really out done themselves with the Black Series. Frankly, as an action figure collector I have been insulted by Hasbro's lack of innovative lines for about the last decade (aside from their Vintage Collection) as I now consider them the EA of action figures. Yet this restores my faith in this company that has monopolized the action figure market by buying up many other action figure manufactures and mass producing the same figures year in and out with just a simple repackage. Finally Hasbro is giving Star Wars the attention it deserves.I got Luke and the Sandtrooper from the first series released back at the end of Summer, I decided to pre-order all of series 2 which I got from another retailer online (Entertainment Earth) since they released their series 2 in mid-October unlike Amazon, who has to wait until November 20th to release theirs. Boba Fett is my favorite character from the Star Wars Universe (how original, I know) but my second favorite character is Han Solo. This figure is the best Han figure I've ever purchased (I have gotten the nearly 25 different versions at least, released by Hasbro in the last 20 years). My favorite look for Han is his long sleeved jacket and brown Captain's Pants he wears in The Empire Strikes Back, so hopefully we'll get that version in series 4 or 5 of the Black Series. People online have complained that no one ever gets Harrison Ford's likeness right, but this actually looks pretty great, the head sculpt even has Ford's chin scar he sustained from an automobile crash when he was young. I really, really like that they included an additional set of hands for Han with his mechanics gloves. Though I wish they had gone a step further and included his head set he wears when piloting the Millennium Falcon. Aside from two sets of hands (one with gloves, one without) Han also comes with two belts. He comes with his side holster for his DL-44 blaster pistol (which has great dry brush paint apps and a silver barrel as it should to make it source accurate) and he also comes with a Stormtrooper's ammo belt as seen when Luke and company land (are tractor beamed) aboard the Death Star. Han also comes with the standard issued Stormtrooper E-11 rifle. I like the black and orange packaging, the display window shows the whole figure and its accessories. The articulation makes for a great range of signature poses that Hasbro's other Star Wars figures just couldn't be put into. The accessories fit well in hand. Overall this whole thing is great, the figure, package, accessories, articulation, paint apps, the works.There are multiple things that work very well for this line. The 6\" size means more figure, more articulation, better likeness. Kenner pushed the 3 \" figure idea back in 1977 that revolutionized action figures and action figure production. With the high cost of oil in the late 1970's, plastic was expensive hence the advent of the 3 \" standard action figure size. Now with all of the new technology being implemented, synthetic plastics are much cheaper to produce. So we can now finally get Star Wars action figures at a scale they've always deserved. Han Solo is one of the most famous and beloved fictional film characters of the 20th century and well into the 21st. This is THE Han Solo action figure to get. He comes with really solid accessories that could have easily been overlooked or not included just so Hasbro could later release a different iteration of Han \"with mechanics gloves\" but Hasbro didn't pull a cheap trick this time around. My hats off to a company who has suckered me into getting the same action figure of the same character time and time again. I feel like Hasbro really did a respectable job with these  figures and to the fans of the Star Wars franchise. Granted Hasbro did get me to buy another Han Solo action figure but to that I say \"can one really ever have too many Han Solo action figures?\" I'd say \"no\", then again I am a dork. NECA has dominated this year with their action figure lines for Rambo and Predator to name a few, but it looks like Hasbro is finally trying to join the big leagues and make some really stellar figures to which I say \"it's about time.\" FULLY APPROVED."],["Finally, a six-inch figure of Captain Han Solo has been released featuring the feisty Corellian space pirate in his prime from the original \"Star Wars.\"  Included are his laser blaster, two gun belts, two extra hands (wearing his flight gloves), and a spare Imperial blaster for good measure.  Suffice to say, for once, a Han Solo action figure actually looks like Harrison Ford.  The figure may be a little more pricey than standard six-inch figures, but it is worth the cost.  Highly recommended!"],["This is my favorite figure in the line so far except sandtrooper and Boba Fett. It has the standard articulation for the line and unlike some other figures, this has the potential to be many. Put his leather belt on and he is ANH Han. Put on ST belt and he becomes death star escape Han. Take both belts off and take off vest to become jabbas sail barge Han. Assemble ANH Han and switch hands to gloved ones to have millennium falcon pilot Han. There are many other combos bit those are the movie ones. I love this figure and hope to see what else the black series has to offer."],["Great addition to the Black Series. Nicely detailed, comes with great accessories. Hope the rest of the series are as nice as the existing ones."],["Pretty good figure, although in this scale I expected a better likeness.

The black series picks up where the vintage collection stopped, delivering the &#34;best&#34; versions of the characters we all love.  Loving the new scale."],["While some Star Wars fans will argue that the definitive Han Solo is as he appeared in The Empire Strikes Back, we were introduced to him first in A New Hope, making his black vest and white shirt an iconic and instantly recognizable combination.  While Harrison Ford's visage seems to be nearly impossible to capture in plastic, Hasbro/Gentle Giant did an amazing job nonetheless.  Unlike some of the Black Series figures, Han comes with quite a few accessories that allow recreating several key scenes from Ep. IV.  Two interchangeable holster belts, two sets of interchangeable hands, an E-11 Blaster Rifle, and his infamous DL-44 Heavy Blaster Pistol.  Only the Sandtrooper and Boba Fett feature as many included items.While this figure may not be as high on some wish lists as others, Han is a solid figure with great posability and in this reviewer's opinion, a must-have for your Black Series 6-Inch collection."],["When I was a child playing &#34;Star Wars&#34; with my friends, we would always get into an argument over who got to be certain characters.  One of my friends always wanted to be Luke for some reason, which actually helped everyone else because we all wanted to be Han Solo, Darth Vader, or Boba Fett.  Sooner or later someone would cave in and be Vader, then Fett.  That left the rest of us to argue over Han Solo.  Solo was and is the MAN in the Star Wars universe.  He got the lady, the cool ship, and a friggin' Wookiee!  Who wouldn't want to be this guy?Hasbro's 6&#34; Black Series line has, for the most part, been excellent.  The Han Solo figure is no exception to this rule.  It's an excellent figure overall.  The likeness to Harrison Ford is very good, and the attention to detail on his clothing, holster, and belts is great.  The figure comes with Han's DL-44 blaster that tucks away nicely into his holster and belt (which can be removed).  He also comes with a Stormtrooper belt, holster, and an E-11 blaster.  On top of that, the figure has interchangeable hands with and without the gloves he is seen using while fighting TIE fighters with Luke in &#34;A New Hope.&#34;The only complaint that I have about this figure is that while he is very articulated, his legs (particularly the feet) are very limited in articulation for posing.  Other than that, though, this figure is wonderful.I really enjoy the 6&#34; Black Series figures.  There have been a couple of misses (particularly Leia's figure), but overall the line has been very good.  It's much better than the 3.75&#34; Black Series figures, but there are a few of those that are excellent as well.If you're a fan of Han Solo (and who isn't?), I highly recommend this figure.  Chewbacca will be released soon enough, and I'm sure he'll look excellent standing next to this scruffy lookin' nerfherder!"],["I was pleased when I received this , will go great to add to collection  good for all responsible collectors"],["I would rate this as the best Han Solo figure ever created. The sculpt was very well designed and the figure has many articulation points. There is a high level of detail including little snaps for the closures for the blaster holster. Highly recommended if you are a Star Wars fan."],["this is truly one of the best offerings from the black series line, great head sculpt detailed enough to show the scar on Harrison Ford's chin, Lots of accessories, the interchangable hands is a nice touch, the removable gunbelt is great, fits the blaster perfectly, the stormtrooper belt is a nice addition. lots of articulation for great poses for display."],["This version of Han Solo fares better than expected. Paired with a good set of accessories, it is almost a wining figure to owns, sans the limited likeness to Harrison Ford.This Han Solo is from the Black Series 6\" line, as seen in A New Hope.The overall sculpt and paint of this figure is really good, with details such as the folds and creases on the clothing really well done.  However, it seems that Hasbro is having issues with getting the likeness right on figures like Han and Princess Leia. Again, it is the face that almost fails this figure. There is some likeness with Harrison Ford, but only when looking at it at certain angles. So as long as you are not looking too close, this is a good figure to pose and admire.The articulation of this figure is as awesome as other figures in the Black Series 6\" line, and an expected standard fore these:- Ball-joined head,- ball-hinged shoulders, swivel right biceps,- ball-hinged elbows, ball-hinged wrists,- ball-joined torso,- ball-hinged hips, swivel thighs,- front-back hinged higher and lower knees, and ball-hinged ankles.The articulation is as good as previous in figures such as the Sandtrooper. However, it is more difficult to hide articulation in this figure, specially on the hips. Yet, the shoulders benefit of a well molded vest, which is its own separate piece. Interestingly enough, the double jointedness of the knees are not as obvious as I thought it would be.This figure includes two blasters, Han Solo's own and a Stormtrooper's. Likewise, it also includes two belts with holsters (Han Solo's and Stormtrooper's) and a pair of swappable hands with sculpted gloves.In all, this figure suffer a bit in likeness, but it is otherwise satisfying. This is yet an admirable first attempt on Han Solo by Hasbro."],["I bought this as a gift for my husband who is a Star Wars enthusiast.

Can be put in cool poses and just looks so nice."],["Anyone who hasn't been buried under a space rock for the last thirty years knows that Han Solo is one of the most revered science fiction characters ever imagined. A western frontiersman gallivanting around the cold dark regions of space, Han spent his youth trying to find trying to find his niche in life. The once Imperial recruit turned smuggler found his way into fans hearts as the hired cab driver of a young Luke Skywalker and a much older Obi Wan Kenobi. In the years following his infamous escape from the death star, Han escaped the clutches of Jabba the Hutt and Darth Vader. Later in life he would father three children with his most favorite committee leader, Princess Leia.Figure mold:Head: Goods- Perfectly molded hair accents the wild youth that Han had at this point in his life.- The scrunch between the eyes conveys the inevitable uncertainty he expressed during his adventures with Luke and Ben.- The paint work on the hair and face is very well done, and I cannot see any runover.- The eyes are straight. This is always a concern with action figures and Hasbro nailed this one.- The likeness is pretty good. From straight on you can really see Harrison Ford's facial features.Head: Bads- For me, a big thing is visible seams. Here on Han's neck are some very identifiable seams.Torso: Goods- Overall I really like the mold of Han's vest and undershirt. The actual mold seems very well done.- The collar really pops and gives him that space pirate look.- The vest is very well done. The color is great and painted well. The little stitch marks are a huge plus. The pocket flaps  actually look like material as the corners pull away a little to give it a natural look.- The bottom of the vest pulls away a little to give Han that look like he is about to pull his Blastec and pop a cap.- The undershirt is molded very well and has plenty of bunch up to give  it a scruffier look. The last little folds do very well in hiding the gut pivot point.- Here we see a great hiding of the seems in the arms. The Hasbro team did a great job hiding the seems in the seems of the shirt material.- Han's vest is removable.Torso: Bads- Really not big complaints here. A little bit of paint rub-off at the elbow joints but not too bad.Hips: Goods- Here we see some great sculpting. Han has two belts, one for his pants and one for his holsters. The first belt, for his pants, is very well sculpted. Every little notch and hoop is present, and look great. The paint work is very well done and little runover is present, even in the very small parts.- The holster belt is equally impressive as the little pockets look realistic and the extra power cells and scope look great molded into it.- The large buckle really shines on this piece and has that heavy metal appearance.- The holsters are pretty good. They look a little more rubbery than leathery, but they have little scuff points and paint rubs that make it look more realistic.- Removable holster belt.Hips: Bads- Once again not many complaints here. Would have been nice to see some stitching on the holster like we did with Han's vest, but that's only a minor complaint.Legs: Goods- The hinge points for the legs are molded well, and the bunching up of the pants hides the joints.- Once again the seams of the mold are well hidden in the pant seams.- The paint work is great with a bold blue paint used with semi gloss.- The red decoration pattern up the sides of the pants is both screen accurate and painted well.- The knee hinges are far superior than in previous releases, as the hinges incorporate a knee cap- Han's boots are both painted and sculpted well.Legs: Bads- The visible bolts or rivets at the knee joint are a bit of an eyesore, but given they are not screw heads like Hasbro's G.I. Joe line, one cannot complain too much.Articulation:- The head has the full 360 degree ball joint and has a hinge joint for up and down chin movement.- The shoulder joints are both ball and hinge.- The elbow joints are hinged.- The wrists are hinged with a ball pin joint for 360 degree movement.- The torso has a rocker hinge neatly hidden under Han's shirt.- Ball joints at the upper leg to hip connection.- Swivel points at the upper thighs.- Double hinge joints for the knees.- Hinge joints at the ankles with a rocker joint at the top of the foot.Accessories:- Blastech blaster.- Blater rifle.- Stormtrooper holster belt.- Interchangeable hands, gloved or non.Package: Goods- One of the best features that fans really took to when these figures were announced was the package. The matte black finish and the orange line down the front really makes it stand out on shelves.Package: Bads- The matte black surface does show scratches and indents well, so special care will need to be taken when handling if you plan to collect the product instead of playing with it.In conclusion:This is probably the best figure in the second wave not including Boba Fett as he's kind of a re-release from wave one, but I will say that Greedo does give Han a run for his credits. With both great sculpting and very good paint work, Han really stands out. Better hinges than wave one make for big improvements, and a more well thought out accessory package adds more playability. Hasbro continues to improve."],["I have been collecting Star Wars figures for a little while and this is by far the best figure line they have ever made.The 3 3/4&#34; line doesn't cut it for me.

My only gripe is lack of directions or info on swapping out the hands (i didnt, but would be nice to know so i dont break something) and the gunbelt, as i prefer his pistol holster over the blaster one. (PS: it unbuckles in the back. peg-in-hole design)"],["These Star Wars Black Series six inch figures look great in their packaging, but, once they're out, all their deficiencies become obvious:First of all, the sculpts aren't terrific, in fact, their 3.75\" counterparts look about as detailed. The characters gain nothing detail-wise in this scale. Second, the price is terrible unless you find it on sale. Hasbro also makes Marvel Legends which retail for four dollars cheaper. Third, the posability initially looks promising but a little time spent with the figure reveals that the addition of double jointed knees does nothing towards dynamic poses and the lack of double joints in the elbows crushes any further possibility.Even Boba Fett cannot hold his blaster rifle properly in two hands.Lastly, there are elements in the body sculpt that impede this posability - ankles do not allow for the feet to turn up even slightly to make the figure crouch, armor elements on Fett and the Sandtrooper get in the way of them  doing - well, just about ANYTHING besides stand at attention. This doesn't make a lot of sense when you consider the recent Hasbro Marvel Legends which are capable of a great many dynamic poses and are often weighted properly so they can stand unaided. Hasbro has the team - why aren't they using them?Essentially, if you must have these figures then do yourself a favor and leave them in the packaging where they'll look great. If you mean to display them you're in for a great disappointment."]],"title":"Star Wars The Black Series Han Solo Figure 6 Inches","total_reviews":31,"sentiment":0.808083871,"label":"positive","best_review":["Intense articulation, very good likeness of Harrison Ford, awesome accessories.

I can't believe they can make stuff so cheap these days. This thing is actually pretty good looking. The sound effects are phenomenal. Switch it on for a satisfying swoosh, wave it around for that light saber buzz, hit something for that crackle sound and finally shut it down to hear movie-like effect.

I think it's shorter and smaller than the FX one, so if you're a die-hard patiwan training for your Jedi master status, stick with the replicas and spend your hundreds elsewhere, but if you're buying for a kid and want the bang for the buck, I believe this to be the most \"realistic\" light saber out there."],["No Jedi wannabe is complete without his or her lightsabre at their side.

(I don't cosplay, but more power to those who do)"],["This is such a great toy!It is always a hit with all of the boys, (young and \"not so young\" alike).It is much more durable than I expected it to be.My son is so proud of it, and it has a lot of value to him."],["My 5-year-old daughter has become Star Wars obsessed in the last month and will be dressing as a Jedi for Halloween, so I brightened up her world by telling her I'd dress up as one too. We're going all out, complete with custom-tailored costumes for both of us. Every Jedi needs a lightsaber, so I decided on the Kit Fisto FX Lightsaber rather than the $8 plastic ones I see everywhere. My first impression is that this thing is COOL! Here's a quick breakdown of the pros and cons:PROS:- Solid Construction: This \"toy\" is built like a tank...even the little knob to turn it on is metal. It is heavy and durable and the blade is solid. I don't know how durable the electronics in it will be, or how long the LEDs in the blade will last, but the outside is as solid as can be.- Bright Blade: Nice bright green blade with an up/down effect when you turn it on/off. In photos it looks totally cool and super bright.- Removable Blade: Blade can be removed by unscrewing the top of the hilt. It comes with a metal insert for the hilt to cover the hole left by the missing blade. Nice touch.- Belt Clip: Comes with a belt clip (though it's cheap plastic) so that you can carry the hilt with you (a must for a costume). The hilt has a Covertec wheel on it that snaps into the clip. Works well and is apparently the same way the characters carried their lightsabers in the movies.- Display Stand: Comes with a display stand that looks pretty good, even though it is cheap plastic. You can configure the stand two different ways, so that you can display it with or without the blade. The stand also has a compartment to store the belt clip and hilt insert.- \"Realistic\" Sounds: Has \"real\" lightsaber sounds sampled from the movies. The motion-sensing features work well, sync'ing the sounds with motion and clashing.CONS:- Sound Quality: Although the sounds are accurate, the quality could be better and louder. Clearly the speaker in the hilt is very cheap.- No Sound without Blade: When you remove the blade, sound is not possible. For fun it makes a little short-circuit sound instead. I'd rather have sound all the time.- Diameter of Hilt: Granted, this is a bit subjective, but I think the diameter of the hilt is slightly too big. My guess is that this is a consequence of the size of the blade and electronics. Considering how heavy it is, if you have small hands it might be hard to grip well when swinging it around.- Belt Clip is Cheap: The belt clip is a great addition, but is very cheap plastic. I won't be surprised if the part of it that clips to the belt breaks. I may order an actualCovertec WIPS System - Belt clipinstead.- Too big and heavy for little kids: Most people probably wouldn't buy this for a little kid, but if you are considering that, be aware the very little kids (like my 5 year old) are way too little for it. It is heavy, with a big hilt, and the blade is very long. Handing this to a little kid is begging for broken items and injuries. If you want something for a little kid that is similar, theStar Wars Ultimate Anakin FX Lightsaberis a better choice. They are around $35-40, lighter, and the blade is probably 8-10\" shorter. No removable blade though.Conclusion:All in all, this is great fun! I have \"dueled\" with my daughter a dozen times already and had a blast doing it. If you grew up with Star Wars, I challenge you to turn on this lightsaber, swing it around, and not feel like a kid again. I give it four stars. If the sound quality were slightly better or if you could get sound without the blade, that would have bumped it up to 4.5 or 5 stars in my opinion."],["It was a little more than I would have liked to pay, but ultimately it's what I wanted, and so I'm happy"],["First a little history:I've owned several Master Replica and Hasbro sabers in the past.  I had to sell my collection some time ago, but I decided I needed to have at least one saber and I had some store credit, so I pulled the trigger on this puppy.  The Kit Fisto saber seemed a good choice because A: Green blade! and B: He's a somewhat lesser known character making the saber more unique.The Hilt: The hilt looks great.  It's mostly brushed aluminum and has a very clean look.  The build quality feels better than the old Hasbro models and more on par with the old MR models.  The lack of many large protrusions on the hilt makes the saber very easy to spin around and maneuver.  The removable blade is great and feels just as solid as any other saber I've owned when it's in.  The blade only takes about 10-20 seconds to attach/detach, and makes a cool sound to confirm that it is attached.  Additionally, it makes a cool short circuit sound when you try to activate it without the blade.  The only minor complaint I have about the hilt is that the activation switch is a little hard to use one-handed.Light and Sound:  The blade glows as brightly as any other Force FX model.  The blade seems about as bright as my old Master Replica Yoda saber, and is easily visible inside during daylight, I can't speak to how it will looks outside in daylight, however.  For the best look though, wait 'til it's dark, go into your living room, close the blinds, and unleash the nerdage!  The sound board on this saber is particularly impressive.  It's loud without being obnoxious.  The sounds are also more varied than any of my previous sabers, and the motion/clash detection is the best of any saber I've owned.All in all, I could not be happier.  My only real complaint is that these things didn't exist when I was growing up.  Now to make up for lost time!  *Runs off laughing and swinging saber wildly*"],["Of the previous Hasbro version lightsabers I have purchased in the past,this one is the least flashy.Hasbro is doing a good job on continuing the Force FX line.It's not quite at the Master Replica level/standards but very close none the least.IMO, Master Replica added that little extra touch of detail and grade of material quality.OK, so!, in terms of the physicall Kit Fisto Force FX lightsaber product;The ergonomic design feels and fits great in the palm.It is not as detailed and flashy as maybe some of the other Force FX line upbut then again that shouldn't matter to any serious collector.Aesthetically, the light saber is accurate to the one seen or used bythe character, Kit Fisto, in the film.The #1 NEGATIVE thing I have to say about this product is that it was recievedwith slight scratches on the hilt (handel).I fear the worst in attempting to ship it back to Amazon for an exchange of anotherjust to hear that someone in shipping has lost my return item.As a collector of the Force Fx lightsabers, the scratches on the hilt is unacceptable.The item's package has small signs of a possible returned item.

The blade itself glows brightly, even in daylight and has a true green color, as opposed to the bluish green I got with the Luke saber. The handle design feels good in the hand and is ideal for maneuvering. As much as I like the look of Anakin or Obi-Wan's sabers, the awkward button placement on both of those really limits the play factor as they were uncomfortable to hold. And having the option to hang the handle on your belt makes the 12-year-old in me feel like such a badass."],["This replica is well done.  The sound effects add a great deal to the saber and the blade is very bright.  It is good for light sparring but I wouldn't go beating on things with the blade.  The detachable blade is excellent and allows the hilt to be worn on a costume if desired (yes I have done so and it works well).My only complaint with the Kit Fisto one is the power switch.  I have the Obi-Wan Kenobi replica and the power switch is a slider on the hilt which is easy to activate.  The Kit Fisto hilt has a twisting knob that is just slightly on the small side as to be aggravating.  While it is possible to activate with one hand, it's not easy at all."],["This was the final color in my collection that I needed and i'm glad i went with the Kit Fisto lightsaber. Its just as big, bright, responsive, and authentic looking as the others, and its removable blade and belt attachment is pretty rad too."],["Chose this one because in doing research read that green was the most vibrant blade and was also interested in the hilt because its 90% metal instead of some of the other sabers with a majority of the parts being plastic. Really great quality and this one runs a little bit cheaper because the character isn't on of the more popular ones, but really pleased!"],["I was in a real doubt for getting this toy. I'm not a collector, I just wanted a pretty shining blade to swing around when nobody's watching. And for that purpose 120$ was for me a little expensive. But I have to say that I don't regret my purchase. Here is my experience:1. The hilt is made of aluminium and fits very good in the hand. It's heavy and stable. - 5/52. The blade is very bright and looks amazing in the dark. There is however a spot that's a bit dimmer then the others (not dark, just dim). It's hardly noticeable but's there. The FAQ shows it's normal and not a defect. - 4,5/53. Sound is good, but could have been better. If you swing it in a quiet surrounding - it's very neat, otherwise - it kinda gets lost. They could have included more effects - 3,5/54. Durability - I bashed it hard against some soft surface and one of my friends for mocking me and there is no damage. But I doubt it's a good idea to swing hard against another blade or a hard surface. For a light sparring it looks ideal. - 4/55. Accuracy to the one from the film - it looks a bit bulkier to what I've expected. This is probably the only thing I didn't like, but it's not so bad. - 4/5Overall it's between 4 and 5 stars - I really liked it, and I enjoy playing with it."],["I spend about a year until I finally decided which lightsaber to take. After watching about hundreds of videos and reading reviews I saw this less famous Force FX of Kit Fisto. The lack of popularity seems to come from the fact that Kit Fisto isn't a major character in the Star Wars saga and the saber was the last issued by Hasbro (and also one of the few which was never built by Master Replicas).PROS:- Awesomely durable. The hilt is completely made of stainless steel with some rubber applications. No cheap plastic parts compared to the Darth Vader, Anakin or Obi Wan- It feels heavy and thus very real- As many reviews suggest, the light seems brighter than many other FXs- Minimalistic design, not as overloaded as the other sabersCONS:- I agree that the sound could be better, but that doesn't lessen the fun.With all the above taken into consideration the Kit Fisto lightsaber seems to the best choice for people who do not collect FX sabers but want to own just one."],["any fan of the clone wars era will like this. kit fisto is a force to be reckoned with. i ordered the lightsaber on a monday and though i didnt pick it up until friday, it was at my post office thursday evening. i love the removable blade makes it great for holloween events. and hopefully up coming movies."]],"title":"Star Wars Signature Series Force FX Lightsaber w/Removable Blade - Kit Fisto","total_reviews":18,"sentiment":0.7127555556,"label":"positive","best_review":["Brilliant quality lightsaber, with fantastic sounds and a very good brightly lit blade.

I've seen the evolution from the Juiced-up figures of Power of the Force 2 to the super articulated The Vintage collection to the sorry-excuse of a figure that was the Movie Heroes line.. I've been fairly displeased with Hasbro with their execution of figures of late, so I was about to call it quits.. But with the recent picts from ComicCon and other toy websites promoting the Black Series, I was like, \"What the heck.. let's try it.\" Good thing I did, since the 6\" Sandtrooper is amazing.  First thing I noticed was amount of articulation. The Head can move forward/backward on the neck joint, and the base of the helmet/head is on a ball socket allowing full rotation. Double jointed knees give the figure the ultra-low posing possibilities (if you're familar with the Hasbro GIJoe figures. it's sorta like that). The hips on the Sandtrooper are inhibited by the accessory belt, so you can't go full van damme side splits, (which is kinda sad), and you can't rotate the knees around, but... it is fairly nice to hold and play with to make Pew pew noises. Upper torso rotates at the chest level and the ankles pivot downard. Comes with three weapons and the backpack, and the orange shoulder paldron (which is removable, when you pop off the head).. So you can make a normal stormtrooper, albeit really dirty one, once the backpack and paldron are removed, and you can even get the head to do the weird off-axis tilt that Luke does when Leia proclaims he's a bit short to be one.  The detail on the helmet is great, and standing next to my Sideshow 12\" sandtrooper, the new 6\" Black Series version does not dissapoint! My daughter (3yrs old) thinks it's pretty cool and is asking for a Dewback to go with it.. but unless Hasbro makes one. I supposed a Pascal plush toy will have to do for now. Not sure what the rest of the black series line will bring, but this one stands out as a nice addition to my collection.As for shipping, mine came properly boxed and padded with bubble wrap so those that are MOC/MISB collectors, need not to worry too much."],["Really great figure of the character, the only thing is price being a bit higher than the norm for the scale.

This ended up being one of my favorite Star Wars things that I own (and I own way too many already!)

Toybiz managed to keep the prices of their six inch figures under twelve dollars for the most part, I just question why Hasbro decided 19.99 as their price point.

As usual Amazon ships quickly. The only part that left me disappointed was that the packaging for the figures arrived in terrible condition. I was planning on leaving them in the display boxes as they also did a great job on the presentation of the packaging.So if you are not planning on removing them from the packages you may want to try and find them in a shop somewhere.

Right out of the gate the first series does not disappoint, mostly because of the fantastic Sandtrooper.The Sandtrooper's armor differs slightly from the regular Stormtrooper armor, and all of these details are accurate in this toy, The head pops off easily to remove the shoulder pauldron, the backpack snaps easily into a hole in the back, and the figure comes armed with 3 accurate and well-done weapons. Articulation is plentiful and the figure can achieve great action poses, limited only by the shoulder armor which restricts some range of motion. The only downside is that the acessories are a bit soft and can bend, and the joints in the double elbows and double knees are a bit soft as well.

Well detailed and packaged would recommend to any Star Wars fans a must for any collection also great value"],["I was not looking forward to collect 6\" figure, until I saw the pictures of the Sandtrooper.  It was way too cool figure to pass in the Vintage Collection, and now in the Black Series 6\" line.  I was doomed.This is Sandtrooper is from the Black Series 6\" line, as seen on A New Hope.The articulation of this figure is short of awesome, surpassing the best from the Vintage Collection:- Ball-joined head, front-back hinged neck,- ball-hinged shoulders, swivel biceps,- ball-hinged elbows, ball-hinged wrists,- ball-joined torso,- ball-hinged hips, swivel thighs,- front-back hinged higher and lower knees, and ball-hinged ankles.Hasbro's modelers have taken full advantage of this armored figure to hide the articulation as much as possible.  You still can see the pegs on the ball-hinges elbows and hinged knees, but the swivel on the biceps and thighs are almost imperceptible, and the ball-hinges on the shoulders and hips are well hidden by the armor.  Unfortunately, the armor limits the freedom of moment on those parts as well.However, the way the ball-hinged ankles work is ingenious.  The foot angles front-back, but swivels inwards-outwards.  So, if you stretch the legs, swiveling the feet inward would allow the sole of shoes to be parallel to the ground.  This makes the figure very stable even in action poses.  In addition, the figure can angle the wrist inward-outward, specially valuable when trying to pose the figure holding its blaster rifle with both hands.On top of a great sculpt and articulation, this figure has an amazing paint job.  The black lines on the helmet are spot on, and the blue highlights behind the cheeks and temples are well detailed.  Also, the white of the armor have been appropriately covered with a dirt wash.  These are details that were good on the Vintage Collection version of this character, but great on this version.Yet, many accessories has been included to complement an already awesome figure.  Besides its blaster pistol, the figure include a light repeating blaster rifle and a long blaster rifle.  In addition, the figure includes a removable back pack, which the figure balances well when attached to it, and a removable orange shoulder pauldron.This figure may have its faults, but I'm too distracted with the good in its sculpt, paint and articulation to notice.  The only thing missing is more of them in my collection.In all, this is a great figure with many weapons to use for posing for those scenes in A New Hope."],["6&#34; Inch Star Wars Figures were Never available before & now because of Hasbro we are able to get amazingly detailed Star Wars figures & i am so thrilled & pleased that i was able to get this figure.It is beautifully detailed ; paint job is amazing & the articulation is awesome.Excellent purchase overall."],["These figures are seriously well done.

Cant wait for wave two. Glad they reposted it on Amazon cause these guys are hard to find."],["When this new line was first introduced the two figures I looked forward to the most were the Boba Fett figure and the Sandtrooper figure. Now that I have both I can tell you that Hasbro does not disappoint. Let me break it down to pros and cons.Action Figure:Starting at the head you'll notice that Hasbro doesn't intend on producing a simple six-inch figure alone, here we see that the attention to detail is intended to replicate the look of each character in the movie.Pros -1) The helmet is molded perfectly to the look of the onscreen character. Its weather-worn look and spots of sand colored paint make the helmet look great.2) The leather cloak over the figures shoulder is very well done and can be removed if need be.3) The hinges at the shoulder are well painted to hide that they are actually hinges, and they are well hidden under the figures shoulder armor.4) The figures armor is well molded and painted. The sand colored wash makes the figure look like he's been out in the desert of Tatooine searching for our lost droids for days on end.5) Even the the paint scheme is pretty basic on the figure with the black and white colors being prominent, Hasbro does a good job not forgetting the little bits and pieces that need separate colors, too.Cons -1) Even though it is a minor complaint there is some paint run over along some of the figures connection points. The belt has a little white here and there where it is supposed to be black, and black where it supposed to be white. Not unexpected.Accessories:The best feature of the piece is probably the accessories. The included weapons and backpack are really the icing on the cake here.Pros -1) The E-11 Blastech blaster is a well molded piece and is not bent like some molded weapons can get.2) On the troopers medium sized rifle, we see just how much Hasbro loves these larger figures. The colors used are amazing and the paint job is very well done. The strap is one color, the grips are another and Hasbro even put little bits of yellow on it just like in the movie stills.3) If a blaster and a rifle are not enough then don't forget the third rifle this figure comes with. Though much more simple than the the others in paint scheme, it is far more detailed in the war-worn look. This one is the long heavy repeating machine gun and it looks great.4) The backpack is a great piece and is removable. The colors are screen accurate, and the paint job is very good. Removable, too.Cons -1) The E-11 blaster is a little too clean for this piece. I know that every trooper must keep their weapon in pristine shape but having a blaster this clean in comparison to how the trooper himself looks worn and torn make the two look odd being together.2) The E-11 doesn't unfold at the stock or under the barrel like we have seen in other smaller figures.Articulation:With plenty of articulation this piece should be easy to both play with and pose. Hasbro choosing to use better hinges and joints make this piece a higher quality than some we've seen in the past.Pros -1) The head has ball joint movement that is somewhat limited by the size of the helmet.2) The shoulders have ball-joint hinges that give limited motion with the armor pads.3) The elbows have ball-joint movement and hinge joint movement as well.4) The wrists are swivel joint AND hinge jointed. Nice feature.5) The torso or upper stomach is ball jointed.6) The upper legs at the waist are ball jointed.7) The knees are double jointed with upper and lower hinges.8) The ankles are rocker hinged.Cons-1) The limitations on the joints by the armor may displease some collectors.Package:Almost as artistic as the piece itself, Hasbro's art department pulls no punches when it came to box design.Pros-1) One of the best features that fans really took to when these figures were announced was the package. The matte black finish and the orange line down the front really makes it stand out on shelves.Cons-1) The matte black surface does show scratches and indents well, so special care will need to be taken when handling if you plan to collect the product instead of playing with it.Overall:Pros-1) Great first six inch Sandtrooper figure we've seen on the market.2) Great accessories.3) Attention to detail.4) Great paint job.5) Great package.Cons-1) Sandtrooper is weather worn but the accessories are not, they are too clean in comparison.2) Not a lot of articulation do to armor.3) Package isn't very durable.4) A little paint over run here and there."],["The color/paint work and the extra accessories really make this deal worth it.  The fine details don't really stand up to inspection, there's some color mixing/overflow in spots, and the parts don't fit together perfectly, if this was a real stormtrooper, he'd have to be a robot since his arm/legs are missing some bits.  But that's just me being picky.When viewed from a foot or 2 away, the detail us amazing, they really did a good job of &#34;dirtying up&#34; this figure, and it harkens back to the original grittiness of the original movies.And it includes pretty much every gun the stormtroopers used in the movies.  Throw in the backpack, and you have a complete set.  Very nice for the price."],["Was pretty excited when Hasbro announced a new line of figures being 6\".

He is in kindergarten this year & has become very interested in everything to do with the Star Wars stories. He was so excited when he opened the box (as was his Dad) & you could just see his imagination going wild! He saw his friends playing outside and took the lightsaber out to show them & they all took turns playing with it! He plans to use it as part of his Halloween costume this year, so it was a definite hit & so much fun to see him enjoying it! Great light & sound effects!"],["I received this product to review as part of the Amazon Vine program.  I played with it, and also my 13 year old daughter - a Star Wars saga fan.  Before taking it out of the box we both were able to check out the lights and sounds as it was in \"Try Me\" mode when it arrived.  Admittedly, it's cool and took me back to hearing the lightsaber sound for the first time, and wishing I had one.The packaging was really easy to get into, which was a shocker, as most toys require ten minutes to get unsecured from their box.  I had the lightsaber out and in my hands in less than 5 minutes. The directions are a small sheet of paper at the top of the box with two basic instructions: 1. Before you begin play... switch mode to 'On' from 'Try Me'.  There is also an 'Off' switch.  The toughest part was finding this switch, which is on the black part of the handle near the base.  2. Press button to activate.  There are also directions on how to replace the batteries with a Phillips head screwdriver.  You need 3 AA batteries for this exchange. *This one arrived ready to play, so no need to new batteries.The age recommendation is 6 and older.  I'd agree, maybe even bump it up a bit to 8 and older as I think younger kids will find it tough not to bash on each other with this thing, and it's not soft!  You could get some 'owies' with a smack from the lighted blade or the handle.  Durability may be an issue if frequently used in battle.  It's not poorly made, but I can't see it taking tons of hard use.The lightsaber blade (lighted) is hard plastic with a rounded end.  About 2\" in diameter.  The total length of the lightsaber is 36\".  When you move the toy in 'On' mode, you get motion activated sound.  It's not very accurate, but it's fun.  I noted more accurate noise was produced when the lightsaber hit objects and the 'clash' sound occurred.  If you are not actively moving it, it goes into a sleep mode and you simply reactivate it by pushing the 'activate' button on the handle. The LED light is bright and changes when the lightsaber hits its target.  The combo of the sound and lights is great.Volume is mentioned by other reviewers, but I really have no other to compare it to to decide whether I'd consider this one loud or soft 'by comparison'.  However it seemed just right for in the house smacking and bashing; scaring the dogs, but not irking the neighbors. Outside I think this one probably would be considered a low volume for those who would love the realistic clash sound to blow back their hair!In terms of fun, it's up there, but it is a bit spendy and I'm not sure the cost-to-enjoyment ratio is worth the price tag.  Undoubtedly die hard Star Wars fans won't care, but if I was buying it for a kid who wanted to play-fight his way to the dark side, it would be tough for me to drop that much change on something where it's made of plastic and where I thought the durability might be in question.My daughter is already planning her Halloween costume around it, as it's 'coolness' is best suited for the dark... with a cape... you get the idea.  Kids and adults will love the toy, but as the durability of it may be an issue, it may be more for posing and light play, rather than stormtrooper bashings in the backyard.UPDATE: August 28, 2011FYI...Note that pricing is all over the map for this item.  Found in a local store for under forty."],["When a Jedi finds them self in need of a new weapon to do battle against evil, not just any lightsaber will do. How can anyone possibly think they will successfully win a galactic fight against the Empire when the batteries on their saber go our after just 15 minutes? Thankfully, now there's an option for a quality lightsaber for those of us on a droids budget.The handle is not flashy, with only a single working button. But with just a press, the bright blue glowing light extends upward from the handle while making an ever so ominous sound of glowing power that's signals someone is ready to fight.  With every wave of the saber, sounds of the familiar electric hum can be heard. Hit something hard enough and a thrashing sound rings out signaling that a blow has been struck. Made with two layers of plastic, the top layer protects the inner layer containing the blue glowing light. So far this weapon has survived several battles against \"bad guys\" wielding broom handles, pillow fights with nosy sisters and a massive war against the Nerf Federation. Hit after hit this lightsaber keeps up with it all and hasn't come close to being damaged.After many battles, the power (running on 3 AA batteries that are included) is still going strong. With the removal of a single screw, you  have access to the battery compartment where there is easy access to replace them when needed.When turning off this lightsaber, the light retracts downward into the handle, making a whooshing sound letting everyone know that the fight it over. VERY well made and able to take (and give) hits without breaking or lights burning out, this lightsaber would be any young Jedi's pride and joy!"],["The best thing about the ultimate lightsaber, by far, is how it looks. You get a pale blue glow the entire length of the blade that envokes a sense of what a 'real' lightsaber would look like. The sound chip overall is excellent. The start up and power down sounds are screen accurate and there is even a sequential light up going up the blade and start up and then down the blade at power down. Overall the sound chip is really good. You sometimes get wooshing sounds when you are not moving it, but any time I hit something on any side of the blade the 'clash' sound comes out.Now for the price you do get a plastic hilt. But the hilt is pretty accurate. And it seem like it will last a long time. One thing to keep in mind is the handle size. It is a perfect size for me, an adult, but it may be too big for most children. But the hilt is easily long enough for two hands. There are 3 power settings on the blade. Be aware that it might be shipped in the 'try me' mode for display at stores. I got mine at a box store so I figured that was the mode it was in. You have an off choice, good for not wearing down the batteries, middle one is try me, then the third one is the one you will use when playing.I first bought the electronic lightsaberStarWars Electronic Lightsaber Anakin 94180because I wanted something that 'retracted'. But here is my take on that one. First it doesn't retract all the way. There are 3 sections. The longest one closest to the hilt never retracts. Second when belted on facing down, the middle section comes out most of the time. So it is over 2/3rds not retracted anyway. And it just looks awful. They only put leds in three spots. If it is pitch black it looks slightly passable, but any other time you use it it looks like a very cheap toy. This actually looks like a light saber. Until they make a retracable one that looks as good as this one, this is your best choice. Certainly for clowing around and for me for a costume as well. Yes it does not retract but it looks great and feels so much closer to a 'real' one that I am very pleased with the purchase."],["When our eight-year-old nephew unwrapped his Star Wars Ultimate Anakin FX Lightsaber, the force was unmistakably with us when it came to our mighty birthday present-giving status.It was the hit of his party--and for good reason.

I was interested in the FX ones, but because of my budget I was always unable to purchase one. Long ago I collected swords and I have them to this fay because back then I had a little more money, and I did not know that the FX ones existed. SO I went through, over the years, a bunch of cheap lightsabers in hopes to find the best one. The Qui Gon Jin toy lightsaber is the bets one I have bought and I still have today because of its super strong plastic it was made from. Seriously, not lying, my friend had no lightsaber at the time, picked up a bb gun, started swinging at me and we fought and my Qui Gon Jin toy lightsaber never snapped or got damaged from bb gun on plastic lightsaber fighting.... NOW, I find the ultimate fx lightsaber. Just WOW! I mean it. This thing is built from the ground up, AND affordable for a struggling saver in a dying economy! Anyways, the reason why I mentioned the swords thigns is because I practice with them and they are balanced rightly. Now I pick up the fx lightsaber and I swear I feel like I am in the movies. It feels right, I mean everything about this lightsaber feels right, perhaps the force is real. From the sensors that react to movement, to how responsive it is in making the battle crash sounds that sound exactly as they do in the moveis, to the humming and powering on and off sounds that are exactly as they sound in the movies. When holding this thing I really do feel like one day if I hit something with it I will cut it in two. ALSO, a huge plus is how bright it is at night AND in the daytime. I swear, on a bright sunny day I can still see it glowing bright blue. Then I start to wave it around and it looks exactly like it does in the movies! AWESOME!!! Its about time I owned a lightsaber worthy of a warrior such as myself. When I am on my death bed I will pass my lightsaber onto my children.Anyways, I absolutely love it. I am bordering on obsession. When I am at work I miss it. Want to come home to it and swing it around my home.

It is most useful at night when the light blade effect is most striking. I am using it as a flashlight for short trips to the carport in the dark, and it is way more fun than a regular flashlight for that. (It is also somewhat dimmer.......)The sounds are reasonably good, although the claimed blade movement noise is not predictable or controllable. The blade start up and shut down sounds are okay, and the \"contact\" noise which you get when you smack the blade into something is fair.The \"blade\" is a tube of (I assume) LEDs which light up in sequence when the \"on\" button is pressed. Pressing that button again will shut the blade off, and reverses the sequence of the lights, which makes the blade look like it is collapsing back into the handle. In the dark, the effect is quite striking. The light tube is encased in another clear plastic tube, I assume for protection. This is good, as one has to smack it pretty hard into something to trigger the \"blade contact\" effect.The detailing is not that great, but then this isn't supposed to be a museum quality replica, it is a toy.Like I said, it is fun in the dark, and I'm sure fans of the Star Wars franchise will enjoy it."],["I own many fx lightsabers but what drew me to this saber is it's the same size as the sabers in the films, (1:1 ratio) whereas the previous fx lightsabers (metal) were noticeably bulkier/more clunky.

Clicking the plastic button feels a tad cheap compared to Force FX, but offers satisfying slide up and whooshing sound (responding to swing and impact movements). Ultimate FX has multiple LED light bands that lights up individually to emulate slide up and down. Unfortunately, there is a noticeable gap between each band that diminishes realism a bit.Another bit of disappointment is that blade cannot be unscrewed.If you are older and has the money to stretch, you will give up few important things compared to Force FX. First, the material. Force FX is made of metal, lending it to more realistic look and feel. While motion sensor sound effects are very realistic, it isn't as responsive, responding to about half as much movement.That said, not even Force FX compares to more expensive Master Replicas series.

And that's good because this saber is designed for children so the price point is more reasonable for that audience. The blade is also shorter which is good for children too. The sound effects are high quality (but a bit low in volume). When the saber strikes an item hard enough, it reacts with a clashing, cool sound. Waving swoosh sounds can also be generated, but one has to swing fast and the saber isn't consistent here.

When you depress a long-ish button on the handle, the light saber powers up from bottom to top with a blue light, with that light-saberish sound we all know and love. When you swing it, it makes a growling, swoohing sound, also true to the movies. When you hit something, the light flickers and makes the proper clashing sound. Depress the longish button again to power the light saber down. While you can hear the sounds, they aren't too loud and shouldn't annoy your significant other or any older sisters.

While I've srongly encouraged my son to be careful with the light saber, part of the special effects (the flickering and the clashing sound) require that you lightly bop it against something. I suspect that many parents may end up buying two. When my son and I play-dueled, me with an older, simple plastic light saber and he with this new one, he of course greatly prefers the new one, and any and all of his friends will, too.While as I've noted above, it feels sturdy, only time will tell if it will continue to work properly after a lot of duels. And while I've carefully explained to my boy the importance of not hitting anything (or anyone) hard with the toy, I imagine it will be occasionally used to thwack things and his little brother when no adults are close by. I'll update this review if the durability seems less than it should be.Overall, this is a fun toy for the Star Wars fans in the house."]],"title":"Star Wars Ultimate Anakin FX Lightsaber","total_reviews":49,"sentiment":0.7155020408,"label":"positive","best_review":["Very Nice Toy.

He loves that the two sabers can come out of his hands and go back on easily."],["Awesome Star Wars product. The black series did not disappoint with this one. Package arrived promptly and without any shipping damage. A must for the collector!"],["This toy is kind of amazing, just throwing that out there now. I really think I love everything about how the execution of this toy was handled.Double hinged knees & elbows. Hinged wrists that rotate and swivel. Hinged ankles and waist. Ball jointed thighs, shoulders and neck. AND I love he's got a little bit of cloth on him so his legs can move a little high than if the cloth wasn't there. Joints are tighter than marvel legends, including the detachable lasers for his lightsaber, which splits in half.The most important paint of the figure, its face, is remarkably well done considering the smudgy look of the other 4 inch figures. His gloves and boots are shiny, like in the movie. His interchangeable head is maybe the worst part about the figure but if THAT's the head you use when playing/displaying him, you're not a Darth Maul fan.Overall I'm very happy with this figure. Seems like very durable in my opinion, and I've had a lot of action figures in my time. Paint is entirely satisfactory.Lightsabers, and other items are perfectly made, lightsaber beams are straight as arrows. For the price and the track record Hasbro has set with marvel legends, I'm amazingly surprised. You won't be disappointed with this figure."],["Product is good! Every detail was amazing.My nephew was so excited about his new toy!He forgot the rest of the toys when I saw this gift."],["Any Star Wars fan will love this action figure.  It was a gift for my 7-year old grandson and he has been playing with it non-stop since he got it.  Having two action figures in one - Darth Maul has interchangeable heads, one plain and the other hooded and built into the robe, which comes off in a single piece - is a brilliant idea.  Looks a hundred times better in reality than in the picture.  The larger 5&#34; size is great.  The light saber is easy to put in Darth's hand and stays there, unlike other weapons included in smaller-sized Star Wars action figures."],["I had to order this figure when I found out there was a solid 6\" Star Wars action figure line. This is the first figure I've bought out of the 6 inch Black Series but if the others are as good as this one, I could easily see myself buying every one.This figure has excellent articulation with good, and tight joints. The clothes are made out of a nice, soft, and flexible plastic along cloth for his skirt. Maul also comes with binoculars, and his double bladed lightsaber that can be put together or separated like when it got cut in the movie. The coolest thing this figure comes with is an alternate head. When you get the figure he comes wearing his cloak. What Hasbro did on this one is extremely impressive. They attached the head he comes with to the hood of the cloak itself. It does hinder his mobility but it guarantees that the cloak fits and looks perfect. The head easily pops off and the soft plastic makes it easy to remove the rest of cloak along with it. The other head snaps on easily and has full articulation.If every Jedi/Sith figure in the Black Series is made with a similar head/cloak replacement design, I will without a doubt buy them all. An excellent figure for Star Wars collectors, especially those who find it refreshing to see a larger figure than most of what they have done."],["I just recently started collecting the 6 inch star wars line and it has not been disappointing and after I saw this one online I knew I had to have it received the item today and looks great the figure is detailed to the last bone and is a great display piece."],["Looks fantastic best darth maul figure do your self a favour and get it good detailed figure  I love it"],["The 6\" Star Wars Black figure series is too tempting for my collector's brain to pass up and Darth Maul is a surprisingly good starting point.Maul comes with his signature double bladed lightsaber as well as an alternate cloaked head and his binoculars.His lightsaber comes apart at the middle and has a peg so that it can be attached to his belt. The beams on the saber will come off, but they do take some effort to pull out.The binoculars don't really seem necessary but they are nice to have as is the second head. The alternate head is great except for one major problem; he can only look forward. The soft plastic cloak is glued to this head so it makes turning his neck nearly impossible; the rest of the cloak does inhibit the articulation a bit as well. It's not a major deal breaker for me though; it looks great and I'll hardly ever use it any way. I've seen way too many terrible cloth cloaks on figures as it is so this is actually what I would prefer.His paint apps are excellent especially for his face. The fact that they were able to make it look this good on one head is amazing enough yet the second head looks just as good. About the only paint error I've noticed is a little bit of bleed from the orange in his eyes and not enough of the bone showing on his horns. It seems fairly common with this figure, but unless you are looking for problems it's not really noticeable.I've read complaints about sloppy paint apps and rubbery weapons with this line but I have yet to see any of it. I'd suggest that if you are worried about it just shop around in store and see what you can find. I've searched plenty recently and the figures I've seen were at Target and Toys R Us for around $20 each. Why Walmart only sells the 3 3/4\" from this line baffles me, but I guess the other stores need my money too. LOLWith a screen accurate sculpt, almost perfect paint, good accessories, great articulation and an awesome price; I can't see how anyone wouldn't be thrilled by this figure."],["Unreal.

Has a great &#34;shelf presence&#34; as it can easily be displayed on my work-space and be a great conversation piece vs. just looking like a &#34;toy&#34;. The best I have seen so far from Hasbro.Not perfect?Why?It may sound silly, but there is no emotion/feeling coming through from these guys. These figures are &#34;big&#34; enough to show some type of &#34;feeling&#34; in their eyes. I don't want to compare to other figures/toy manufacturers, but I know the technology is there and they could if they wanted to. Especially this figure - he thrived on inflicting fear.Therefore, the ONE thing that would make this figure (and all others in this line) &#34;Perfect&#34; would be either additional/interchangeable heads (or faces) in an emotional state. Some of these characters are so full of depth/emotion in the movies - this is a great opportunity to let it show! Obviously R2 or Greedo are not the best example of this.Darth Maul here technically comes with another head, and would be a great &#34;example&#34; - I believe it would be beyond perfect if the figure had other heads/faces showing the anger / fear / dread / etc. from a key instance in the movie when they were either fighting or facing a dire circumstance. The neck/head has a ball/socket joint which lends itself for the interchangeable head scenario anyway! If anyone at Hasbro is reading this - please consider for future -OR- at least get feedback and see if customers are interested in &#34;expansion packs&#34; with extra figure heads -and other accessories- that would complete these figures and bring them to perfection!"],["Highly detail , the articulation is nicely done , painted with skill !!!

This is hands down one of the best Star Wars toys that Hasbro has ever released.  It's likeness to the character, articulation, sculpting detail and playability are all near perfect in my book (The 3.75 inch version cannot compare).  Short of paying 200$, this is the best version of Darth Maul you are going to find.  My only complaint would be that the figures' articulation is slightly hindered by the cloak in the shoulder area; however, you are still able to pull of some great menacing poses.

Several points of articulation, and it's one of the best Darth Maul figures I've seen.  A great addition to any Star Wars fan collection."],["Awesome detail.  Love the 6 inch figures in the Black series.  I like the fact that it has a changeable head and love the details of this action figure."],["This version of Darth is a nice 6ish inches tall and fits with the others in the series.  I also picked up Luke and R2 in the set.  Darth is the best of the set, while R2 failed to deliver what the prototype promos promised.  How's that for a tongue twister?  I was able to nab all three on special here for around 10 dollars each.  If you can get a similar deal, these are no brainers for the collecter.Darth comes with cloak, alternate face, duel sabers [that can combine as in the movie], and binoculars.  The faces are very well detailed and painted.  Poseability is best without the cloak, as it is tough plastic/rubber, but I think he looks best with it equipped.  I'm probably in the minority, but I would have preferred to have a cloth cloak.  I suppose that wouldn't have looked so crisp and detailed, though."],["I was so excited to get this Darth Maul figure for $10, that I got four. Only to discover the facial tattoos,& eyes are as careless painted as every other Maul figure. Amazon appears to play hockey with the boxes, collectors beware. It's a nice idea but doesn't deliver. Buy them in a store where you can see what you are getting quality wise."],["Pros: The detail is impressive! The articulation is much better than the smaller figures.Cons: Why is the lightsaber flexible?? Should be rigid plastic."],["At its $20 MSRP, this is one of Hasbro's first four figures to venture into the more collector-friendly 6-inch format after 35 years of just 3.75-inch figures. Maul is a good choice to start because he's &#34;Darth Action Figure&#34;, a character who has few lines and almost no personality, is just there to sling a double-bladed lightsaber while troubling our heroes.Hasbro's figure starts off well, sculpting is good bordering on very good. Granted, the larger format exposes some of the more significant challenges in taking a nice sculpt to production level, there are unattractive knee joints and exposed hinge pins throughout, and the boot joint is downright dubious to look at. But overall it looks pretty good out the gate. Some areas however are unacceptable, the fat horns remind one of 1999's first Darth Maul toys, there's no finesse. The face holds up pretty well as a sculpt, the expression is angry in the eyes but not overly so in the mouth, giving it a determined look. The biggest challenge overall is just being a plain figure in simple, monotone robes while incorporating a little black fabric element here and there, with no real &#34;wow!&#34; areas to focus on.Another knock is the paint, it's fair but I've seen several and the face paint is never straight on any of them, the eyes are never quite right, and the horns are downright awful. Having no other paint, the rest of the deco is carried by sculpt and materials changes, and it lends to a rather dull experience. And then the striking red face paint up close has some wrong details (the cheeks being most notable) and some areas that simply don't measure up, like the &#34;tongue&#34; tattoo on the chin - when you're the face of a franchise for several years, it's bound to get consumers familiar with that look, so better get it very right.Articulation is a major hangup on this figure, it has a decent amount but too many joints have issues. The neck is an odd front-back hinge with a ball joint on top, this is fine for a lot of poses but side-side bending is left out which hampers some expressions. The shoulders and elbows are ball-hinge joints but fairly limited in their range, especially the elbow that can almost get 90 degrees bent facing exactly forward in one spot, and the rest it's notably less than that thanks to the costume sculpt. The wrists are hinge-rotate joints, but the left hand hinges in-out while the right hand hinges up-down so it takes a little forethought. The lower torso is ball-jointed, and this is by far the best joint on the figure, very expressive.The leg joints get their own paragraph because they're all infuriating to a degree. The hip joints are ball joints on a rod, the joint is too small, has too little range of motion (fair but not extreme, which this character really needs), and is exceptionally loose in 2 directions making posing extremely challenging, side-to-side slips easily and front-back has too much play. The upper thighs are swivels and work fine at least. Each knee joint is a very large double joint with a ratchet feel inside, this works but is unattractive. The last joint is the ankle, and it's an oddity, a small hinge-and-rotate that allows the foot to bend down and roll in - it's an anatomically-accurate joint but it's not attractive, it's odd and it fights with the hip joints for stability, and without a boot rotation joint it's limited.Between the limited elbows and the nigh-useless hips, this figure is at best a chore to pose and most often impossible to keep standing. Since that's its singular job as an action figure, it's infuriating. There are also no figure stands with 4mm pegs that I know of which could help.Accessories include Maul's electrobinoculars which are well-sculpted and painted but the figure's crummy arm and neck articulation make using them a bit of a challenge. There's also the double-bladed lightsaber, cast in gray plastic with only buttons and rings painted, it comes apart in the middle to simulate being chopped in half, has a peg for the figure's belt, removable red blades that are about 25% too short, and is overall so gummy that the hilt and/or the blades never will look straight enough in the figure's hands.The final accessory is the most frustrating, it's Maul's Tatooine cloak complete with an alternate head that pops over the neck ball-joint. The cloak is cast in thin, rubbery plastic which has some movement but still comes off fairly limiting. The head is glued onto the cloak well, so it hangs correctly and looks alright, but limits poseability. Most aggravating though is that it's too small, it doesn't close and doesn't flow at all, it's too small so it looks less like a stealthy Sith cloak and more like a thin bathrobe.All in all, it's hard to say this is a bad figure, but it's unfortunately had greatness stolen away by questionable choices at too many areas of production, making a figure that is frustrating to pose and basically impossible to leave standing in most positions, with accessories that all come up short."],["This toy is something that I saw at target a few months ago and didn't get it ;However, I was still able to pick this up online. Further more, I enjoy this buying this because it was a lot of fun waiting for something that I wanted for awhile to come in the mail. I do plan on buying the star wars the black series Boba Fett here on amazon very soon. :)"],["Once I seen this wave out in stores, I had to pick them up.

I would like to get the other styles eventually."],["While their 3.75&#34; counterparts in the Star Wars Black Series are running into problems like mold quality, paint schemes, and packaging, the 6&#34; Black Series figures are impressive, most impressive.  One of the most impressive figures in the bunch is Darth Maul.  He features multiple points of articulation literally from head to toe, and he comes with three accessories.One of the accessories is a cloakless head.  I'll go into more depth on that piece in a moment.  The second accessory is the pair of binoculars that Maul uses when he first arrives on Tatooine.  They look great.  They are molded quite well and feature excellent paint.  The third accessory is Maul's beloved dual lightsaber.  It actually comes in two pieces, so you can recreate the moment when Obi-Wan breaks Maul's lightsaber.  The two pieces can be attached thanks to a slotted piece which forces them to come together correctly.  This means you don't have to worry whether or not Maul's hilt looks correct when you're posing the figure.Maul comes packaged with his cloak on.  It's made of soft plastic.  In my opinion it looks great.  It's much better than the soft goods that usually come with this figure.  It does hinder poseability, but Maul looks very menacing with it draped over his horns.  There are a few bits of soft goods under Maul's belt which do allow for more poseability once you remove the cloak.  When you do remove the cloak, Maul's head goes with it.  The head is attached to the cloak, which once again limits articulation, however, the additional head can be snapped in place and it gives Maul his look when he took on Jinn and Kenobi.With the cloak off, you literally pose Maul in hundreds of ways.  He holds his lightsaber well in both hands, stands on his own quite well for the most part, and just looks freaking awesome.I was a bit hesitant to purchase any of the 6&#34; Black Series line, but the quality of the Maul figure has convinced me that I should buy more of them.  I also have the Luke Skywalker figure, and I plan to add Han Solo, Slave Leia, and hopefully Boba Fett to my collection soon.Highly recommended."],["This is a great 6 inch figure. It has pretty decent articulation, very similar to that of the Marvel Legends figures done also by Hasbro. The cape is removable so you can swap heads, the lightsaber comes apart in the center as shown in the picture, the blades are also removable, and there's a hook on the lightsaber so it can hang to Maul's belt. Overall he's a nice looking figure and balances well. So far I've purchased all the 6 inch black series SW figures except for R2D2 for this set and I've already pre-ordered Boba Fett and Han Solo off of Amazon (best price for Boba Fett when I was pre-ordering at that time)."],["Finally what I have been looking for in Star Wars figures! A classic collectible line!Problem is now it's a little late in the game for the 6\"figure hype and each figure is a whopping $20 each!I'm planning on being a casual collector if this line.I will most likely only get two or three fights per movie. That said they really need to up the game!I was excited about this line but here is what I got.Pros:A solid figure with excellent likeness and a decent amount of accessories.He comes with two connectable sabers with removable blades, extra hooded had with cloak and binoculars.Cons:I don't think he is worth 20 bucks. Luckily he is also on Amazon for 10ish.His sabers also do not connect well and the handle are a cheaper plastic.

Was so surprised on Christmas when he got it."],["This is another great entry for the Black Series. good head sculpt, decent paint. the face tattoos were good, the horns, not so much. most of the horns are red with white/tan tips so they'll have to be repainted. great articulation for displaying in iconic poses, as with Obi Wan, love the integration of cloth and plastic to make up the layered tabbard. 2 piece saber hilt with removable blades is another plus.downsides, again, some of the paint details, the saber hilt is a little oversized so posing him wearing the hilt looks ridiculous. the rubber outer robe is a mess. it should have been textured and treated with a flat paint to take away the glossy rubber look and removes the ability for a lot of good poses. but despite these issues it's still an impressive figure for display and a worthy addition to the Black Series."],["The Darth Maul is a great figure.. the only way to improve would have been a cloth robe instead of the plastic... but this is probably just my preference.  I bought a robe off ebay that works great on this figure"],["This really is a very impressive figure. Well detailed and nicely packaged this is a boon to any collector's collection!"],["This Darth Maul is from the Black Series 6&#34; line, as seen in The Phantom Menace.  This figure has very good likeness to the character, and brought some interesting accessories that would have made it a winner.  If you were a Phantom Menace fan.The overall sculpt of this figure is very good. The likeness to character in the movie is impressive.  This seems to be the only non-helmeted character in three waves so far that doesn't have a neutral expression.  Although, frowning seems to be Darth Maul default expression.  Other details are very well sculpted such as folds and creases on the black tunic and it includes fabric below the belt.The articulation of this figure is as awesome as any other figure in the Black Series 6&#34; line; an expected standard for these:- Ball-joined head,- ball-hinged shoulders, swivel right biceps,- ball-hinged elbows, ball-hinged wrists (right wrist swivels side-side, left wrist swivels front-back),- ball-joined torso,- ball-hinged hips, swivel thighs,- front-back hinged higher and lower knees, and ball-hinged ankles.This figure suffers no limitations.  The hip articulation well hidden by the black fabric and plastic tunic, but double jointedness of the knees and ankles are a bit obvious, but these issues can not be helped. One nice thing is that the right wrists swivel side to side, which is good for posing him pointing at a target with his double lightsaber.This figure includes a binocular, a double red lightsaber (removable blades and split sabers) and an additional head.In all, this figure suffer a bit in the paint job, but it is otherwise satisfying."],["This star wars line is great!  Darth Maul is my favorite so far.  It has great articulation and details.  Watch out for sloppy paint on Darth Maul's face tattoos though.  They do seem to have gotten better since the initial release."],["This is one of the Most Amazing Figures from the Star Wars Black Series & it is just an Awesome Purchase.Amazing details & Articulation.This figure perfectly captures the Sith Lord in all his glory in 6&#34;inch Scale.These figures are perfect for a Star Wars Collection."],["Darth Maul is an obvious choice for the 6-inch series of Star Wars figures.  He's one of the most popular characters in the series and with all his small details, a 3 3/4th figure has never truly captured the terror he invokes into his enemies.  This was a great opportunity for two birds to be killed with one stone.For the most part, I think this Maul sets the new standard.  He's certainly better than any 3 3/4th Hasbro Maul I've seen.  But, I also have to admit it could be better.  So then why did I give it 5 stars?  Well, for what I'm looking for, the figure is perfect.  At least mine is anyway.  I've heard some grumbling about the ranges in quality from figure to figure.  Unlike stormtroopers or droids with straight, clean lines, Maul is very detailed and has many intricate aspects in his design.  He's the type of figure that if one part is off-center or smudged it is amplified.If you get a 6-inch Maul and his tattoos are off to one side than it's going to stand out.  And with this scale, it stands out much worse than the smaller versions of the past.  Same thing with the eyes.  I agree with whoever said this figure is better off bought in person rather than online.  Look over the figure you are about to buy and consider it's particular quality control.  I was lucky.  I saw one in TRU yesterday and it was the last one.  In person, this figure is visually striking and caught my eye immediately.  Some say it isn't worth the 20 bucks, but I disagree considering that I'm never happy with the 3 3/4th inch Mauls and the high-end stuff is more money that I'd spend on a figure.  So, there is a market for this and the cost isn't too bad as long as it's has good paint apps.The picture of this toy on Amazon's main page doesn't do it justice.  In the package it looks phenomenal.  Here is where rating this figure gets tricky, however.  The fact that you can change Maul's head is a very cool thing.  Some people love the \"phantom\" Maul with his hood.  Others love Maul with his horns showing.  For me, the only reason I bought this figure was because of how Maul looked in the package--hood up--reminiscent of my favorite scene in the Star Wars films when the jedi are walking out of the hangar on Naboo and the doors unexpectedly open up right in front of them only to reveal Darth Maul standing there completely composed and confident he'll destroy them.  That's literally the only way my figure is displayed.  Hood up and standing upright with his hands at his side.And that's lucky for me.  Because the extra head my Maul came with (the spikey one) has serious QC issues.  The tattoos that go down the nose are curved to the right side.  The horns look very lazily painted.  The tattoos on the cheeks are blemished and the ones on the lips are off-center as well.  The lightsaber also looks kind of cheap and one half of it is bent a bit.However, the hooded face is damn near perfect.  It's night and day.  The red paint looks flawless and the tattoos look straight out of the movie.  His hood cups his face perfectly just like the hangar door scene and he looks like he is staring a hole through you with every bit of malice he can sum up, wanting to kill anything in his path. And in that regards, this figure is perfect.  At least the one I have.  I would be bummed if it was the opposite though so I get the complaints people have with the inconsistent quality.So, again, if you buy it online without knowing what you're really getting just be warned."],["This action figure is not perfect, but it's pretty damn close! At least in terms of collectors getting a truly satisfying depiction of the modern day icon, Darth Maul. Darth Maul has always evoked &#34;badass&#34; to even the most staunch Star Wars fanatic. In many ways he ended up representing this past decade's new brand of action star that was fast, ruthless, light on his feet, and was able to deliver a bevy of devastating combative strikes on his enemies. Unfortunately, the flexible fiend was never represented in quite the right way. There were some premium format figures that came close but were expensive. The classic 3 3/4&#34; line gave us enough figures but hardly any of them could strike the iconic poses that Maul was shown performing. Hasbro finally bit the bullet and decided it was about time that Star Wars got the coveted 6 in.&#34; scale treatment. And what better character to showcase the true potential of this scale than the nimble Darth MaulDarth Maul's design is mercifully simple to capture. The figure features a mat black plastic molding with gloss black paint adoring the gloves, boots, and sash. The designers intermingled soft goods fabric at the &#34;skirt&#34; region to allow for extra give when posing. The cloaked and uncloaked heads are wonderfully sculpted and feature excellent paint application, except, famously, not on the crowning horns. Hasbro never seems to get the horns right! The eyes are killer though. Your mileage may vary though depending on the figure you get.The figure features 30 or so points of articulated movement which makes for one impressively poseable figure. There is hardly a pose you won't be able to get Maul into. It ends up being the little touches here like ball socketed ankles that allows for transverse movement of the foot which in turn allows for &#34;flat footed&#34; placement in any pose, and the hinged wrists that add personality potential to the figure. Lastly, he comes with his iconic decoupling double bladed lightsaber. The red blades are removable so you can store it on his belt-sash and the hilt is detachable so he can wield one or two sabers in each hand. Glorius!For this inaugural wave, Darth Maul is the runaway hit of Star Wars Black! He truly showcases the potential this line can offer."],["This darth maul is the best one ever made especially a 6in and well sculpted with lots of articulation and detail.

I can see these becoming collectible as it is very difficult to find them in stores so get them while they are still available online."],["Darth Maul is close to perfect for me.  He does have some limited range of motion with his cloak on (why I'm not giving him a &#34;love it&#34; rating) but other than that, I really do like this figure.  The 6 inch size lends well to the articulation and detail of the figure.  When Hasbro goes to a larger size (12 inch), they tend to get chunky but not this time.  I have been very impressed with the 6 inch line and intend to collect more of them.  Maul comes with several accessories.  I love that you can take the attached-head-cloak piece completely off and put the single head on providing you with a whole other figure.  You have a ton more articulation with the cloak piece off and it looks GREAT!  I have him posed like the Theed Hangar Duel trailer pose and looks phenomenal.  This is a no brainer for any Star Wars/Darth Maul fan, must buy."],["The figure itself is awesome.but for some reason amazon sent this in a bubble mailer!!!!These are collectors series abd pretty pricey at that.Igot lucky and just a little crease.Will see what condition the other three are in when they finaly get here.....bonehead move on Amazon's part!!!!!"],["Darth Maul, one of a few good things that came from the prequels, is a great six-inch figure but it does have a few things that may - or may not - disappoint some collectors. So let's break it down to pros and cons.Action Figure:With the robe and his tunic, Maul is a more difficult mold to say someone like Luke or R2 but even with all the folds in the fabric Hasbro does a great job with the mold.Pros -1) Great mold. The figure looks really good and the mold is top notch.2) Great facial likeness.3) Eyes are not painted cross-eyed.4) The additional swappable head is a nice bonus.5) All the folds around the elbows, knees, and ankles look amazing.Con-1) I think the most notable decision that may disappoint some collectors is the vinyl cloak. To me a fabric robe would have been a far better choice given they look great on the 4-inch and 12-inch.Accessories:Even though limited in number, the included accessories are of a high enough quality to make up for the lack of number.Pros -1) The dual-lightsaber is molded very well.2) The D shaped union for the two separate lightsabers make sure that the two line up properly.3) The Red blades are well molded and are translucent enough to look more real.4) As mentioned above the second head makes it so the figure can be displayed with or without his robes.5) The macro-binoculars are molded great and have a weather worn look that makes this simple piece really stand out.6) Figure has pin on waist to hang hilt(s).7) Blades are removable from hilt(s).Articulation:With plenty of articulation this piece should be easy to both play with and pose. Hasbro choosing to use better hinges and joints make this piece a higher quality than some we've seen in the past.Pro-1) The joints at the shoulders, elbows, wrists, torso, legs, knees and ankles are Hasbro's top of the line joints and are very similar to the G.I. Joe line.Con-1) As expected the head that is attached to the robe has no articulation.Package:Almost as artistic as the piece itself, Hasbro's art department pulls no punches when it came to box design.Pros-1) One of the best features that fans really took to when these figures were announced was the package. The matte black finish and the orange line down the front really makes it stand out on shelves.Cons-1) The matte black surface does show scratches and indents well, so special care will need to be taken when handling if you plan to collect the product instead of play with it.In short:Pros -1) Great mold.2) Great accessories even though limited in quantity.2) Great package.Cons -1) Limited in articulation with molded cloak.2) Would have been better with cloth cloak."],["Item looks good in packaging so I am displaying it as is.Not sure if cloak is detachable as one pic shows figure without it & that pose looks good as well."],["Nice start to the new 6\" line. I own pretty much all of the Darth Maul figures but not in this size. Like the other 6\" figures, I like the packaging and the box art. Pretty detailed figure from top to bottom. Like his saber too. Haven't enjoyed a Maul figure like this since the 12\" came out many years ago. Although I keep my figures sealed, I've seen vids of him w/ and w/o his cloak. I actually like him w/o the cloak on better. I agree w/ the other reviews that I wish they would just go all out and give us a cloth cloak instead of the plastic one. I would have paid more for it. I guess you could make your own. At least there's detail on it."],["Very cool articulated figure. Its about time Hasbro made a Star Wars line of figures in this scale and with tons of articulation! My only gripe is that I am a fan of cloth capes on figures. I do not like molded stiff coats/capes, etc on figures they usually make posing them impossible.And as a side note, this doesnt affect the toy itself but Amazon IS shipping these figures in paper/bubble mailers. And if you are a collector like I am, be fore warned that yours will NOT arrive in mint shape or without a few corner dings or crunches. Even though I was disappointed by that, the figure itself is cool!!"],["This is modeled great, bought for collecting, but the knees and such will wear quickly with normal play.  These things are not made like the old GI Joes and Starwars of the 80 and 90s.  Highly detailed and great for collectors, but not so much for kids."],["This is the figure they should of released back in the 90's . Not only does this figure have great articulation but the whole package is quality . The light sabers Buttons are all painted , they eyes look amazing the horns are painted better then the smaller scale version . I find myself wanting to buy another one because of the additional head. BUY THIS FIGURE!!!!!!!!!"],["This is just..wow. Such an amazing toy. The sculp, the paint, the articulation especially. One of the best articulated toys i have. There's so many tiny details in this that just make this toy so amazing. The hood shows the horns popping out from the top. It's crazy. The only problem i have is how bendy the saber hilt is. I usually just use one saber. But this dude is positively worth buying"]],"title":"Star Wars The Black Series Darth Maul Figure 6  Inches","total_reviews":57,"sentiment":0.767945614,"label":"positive","best_review":["Looks fantastic best darth maul figure do your self a favour and get it good detailed figure  I love it"]}]
