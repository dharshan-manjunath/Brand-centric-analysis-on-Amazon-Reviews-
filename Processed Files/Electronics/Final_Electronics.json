I must say, I'm loving this purchase. I bought it directly from Dell when they were having a special that combined it with a tablet for free. The monitor's bezel is amazingly thin--less than 1cm, and it pretty much melts away into the darkness if you use it in low light settings. Color reproductions is a lot better than my old monitor, and it's a very bright display. The touchscreen capacitive buttons are simple yet modern, and the HUD is pretty simple to navigate--but it's a little unresponsive at times, not a major issue by any standards. Text and photos render very crisply, and the expanded screen real estate that I have compared to my old HP is a very welcome change. This monitor is VESA mount compatible, but the stand included has pivot, swivel, and rotates up to 90 degrees--very versatile for my situation. I can now fit this in the corner of my desk and still look at it dead-on. It has a plethora of USB ports, USB 3.0 not just 2.0, as well as 2 HDMI ports, 2 Displayports, and 1 MiniDisplayport (if you have a compatible tablet). In the box came a displayport cable, power adapter, and a USB Type B Male to USB Type C male cable 3.0 (excellent for hiding wires from keyboards or wireless dongles) The viewing angles, as expected with any IPS display, are amazing, with very minute distortion. The anti-glare coating on top of it isn't very harsh at all, and colors are produced sufficiently accurately--grays actually look gray, and blacks do as well. It's no glossy monitor, but for most gamers and photographers (like myself) it's a perfect solution. Overall, it's been a great purchase."],["By itself or paired, this display is remarkable! Excellent color, contrast and brightness. Superb clarity (especially against the &#34;grainy&#34; previous generation, which I've also owned). And modern inputs! 2 HDMI, 1 DP, 1 miniDP, and a DP 1.2 output. I only use the Display Port (mini and regular) at the moment, but I have each hooked up to my PC tower and MacBook, respectively.Bezel is minuscule! There is only a subtle, slightly curved nature to the left and right edges of the display when you're looking from an angle, but I do not find it bothersome (and I'm picky).If 1920x1080 is sufficient for you, and you want one of the best possible displays available at a reasonable price, this is it."],["This monitor is simply beautiful. I bought this to turn my Macbook Air (2013) into a desktop like device that I could use on the go too. Images are crisp, the finish is matte, so glare is not an issue, and the USB 3.0 Hub works great. I was deciding between a larger monitor and this, but this fits perfectly on my desk and the resolution is perfect for me. The price of this simply cannot be beat particularly for all the features you get.Just so it's clear, this monitor has 3 inputs - DisplayPort, mini DisplayPort and HDMI. I cannot comment on Daisychaining, as its unsupported on OS X outside of a thunderbolt display (At least as of currently)A few issues I had to avoid frustration for you:1. The included DisplayPort to mini DisplayPort cable simply didn't work for me. I tried for hours looking of forums for solutions, and finally just ordered a miniDisplay Port to Mini Displayport cable here on Amazon, and it connected right up.Cable Matters Gold-Plated Mini DisplayPort Cable in Black - 6 Feet2. If you power this over HDMI, the power save mode takes about 5 minutes to shut off the monitor. Use DisplayPort, the monitor shuts off instantly into power save mode. There seems to be no way of adjusting this power save timing while displaying over HDMI3. Audio through the DisplayPort works in OS X too. It saves me having to plug and unplug speakers each time I dock my laptop.The cable issue (which may just be a defective cable) is why I'm removing 1 star from this review. You will not be disappointed with the quality of this monitor, and the level of color density certainly has me far preferring this over my Macbook Air display."],["Very nice monitor.  I would give it 5 stars if it came with an HDMI cable.  I used the mini display port cable that came with it to my laptop and it is a little glitchy.  You also have to hit the 'touch' power button a couple of times occasionally to turn it off. Overall a pretty nice monitor."],["Beautiful picture, efficient design allows the largest display in the smallest space.It's brand  new, but unfortunately it doesn't work and is now in the shop of a tech being worked on at my cost. It's not worth further aggravation to try to get help from Dell, whose &#34;techs&#34;don't know their own product. Problem is we can't connect to my Dell Optiplex computer - no HDMI, no VGA, only 2 display ports in the monitor and one in the computer and it doesn't work !I've had nothing but serious problems with everything since I started with Dell a few months ago: a computer, 2 monitors, a stereospeaker, all worked on by paid outside techs. In 30 years of using computers I've never had such difficult products or worse, lessknowledgeable &#34;techs&#34;. I do not recommend Dell.H.L.Jay"],["Beautiful monitor.  The slim bezel was the selling point for me!"],["While being slightly more costly than other 1080p monitors, this onebmore than makes up for it in picture quality. The colors are excellent and itb comes pre calibrated to sRGB out of the box.  Response time is solid for not being a gaming monitor. Has the latest LG IPS panel with great viewing angles. The height adjustable stand and USB 3.0 hub is a nice touch."],["It works very well, great monitor. Setup was a breeze, et cetera."],["Great monitor!  Bought it to replace an HP IPS monitor that was acting up.  Very nice picture quality, and typical quality Dell monitor. I should have just stuck with Dell rather than trying the HP."],["Before getting into the details, I'd like to provide some background information. I used to own a glossy display 24inch IPS panel. It stopped functioning and I ended up getting a 23inch matte Asus TN panel, exactly one year ago. I bought into the whole 1ms response time that was advertised and decided to go with the Asus monitor. I noticed day one that the colors were off no matter how much I calibrated the settings. The only good thing about this TN monitor was the contrast. However, I couldn't stand the terribly uneven and inaccurate color reproduction and finally decided to switch back to an IPS.My main use for this Dell monitor is gaming on my Playstation 4 as well as film watching. If you're looking for a 24inch monitor, this one is nearly PERFECT. First off, I want to talk about the advertised 8ms response time. Immediately, for gamers, thats a red flag, BUT after checking out TFTCentral's in depth review of this monitor, I learned that the ghosting and response times are actually as good as it gets for an IPS panel and I can attest to that. I can't help but compare it to my 1ms Asus and believe me, there is no difference and I can catch ghosting and overshoot pretty well. Now onto the matte finish; It uses a light coating which is a nice improvement over my old Asus because it allows for colors to pop more and provides for a less muddier and more sharper image. Also the matte is a plus if you hate glare which personally wasn't ever an issue for me. Matter screens typically also provide deeper blacks. Now the colors are fantastic. The standard mode that its set to at default is decent, but the factory calibrated sRGB mode is fantastic. Theres also a custom mode which you lets you set the colors the way you like and tweak everything else as well. Those two modes, sRGB and Custom, are the best that make colors reproduction very accurate and vivid. The contrast is very good on this monitor as well, being the best in Custom just by a bit. There IS IPS glow, but thats expected and its honestly not that bad and I sit just 2 feet away. The stand is also incredible sturdy and as you're probably already aware, its got a lot of maneuverability. This monitor also has a lot of good ports including an audio out for headphones or more likely speakers. I know not all gamers prefer IPS panels, but for those who do, you can't go wrong with this monitor. The one downside to this monitor, which doesn't actually affect me, is the Nvidia display port color issues. If you aren't aware yet, the color scheme is automatically set to limited RGB and can't be changed. Theres also the expected HDMI limited RGB issue with Nvidia cards but there is a work around for that, a simple downloadable program that lets the colors be displayed in full RGB through HDMI (this program can be googled, just be specific about the monitor and issue). If you plan on using this monitor with Nvidia video cards, remember that you'll want to use HDMI and download the program that lets it display full RGB. Otherwise, this monitor is fantastic for gaming and AMD cards work perfectly fine.To sum it up, this monitor works incredibly well with my PS4 or any other gaming system for that matter. PCs with Amd video cards work just as good, the only issues being with Nvidia cards which do have an easy fix but only through HDMI. Neither Ghosting nor overshoot is noticeable and I've got good eyes coming from a 1ms TN panel. Colors are fantastic. Great Ports. Awesome maneuverability. I'd recommend you check out the in-depth review for this monitor on TFTCentral. You can google it. Anyways, its a fantastic piece of equipment and you won't regret your purchase! It also comes with a mini-Display port to Display port cable as well as a usb 3.0 upstream cable as well as drivers and documentation. It is very well packaged to top it off."],["Recently purchased a new desktop computer with HDMI only video output. This was just what I needed in form, fit and function. The price was right as well."],["very bright, small bezel, got this working daisy-chiained from my Surface Pro 2. highly recommend this esp for the $"],["I was looking for a monitor that was was near-100% sRGB, was out of the box calibrated well, supported DisplayPort, had a very low processing latency, and used an IPS, PLS, or similar panel.There isn't many choices, you can get gamer monitors that have &#60;1ms processing latency, but use TN panels and are pretty ugly; and you can get IPS/PLS professional monitors that are calibrated very well but have 20-40ms processing latency (including other Dell UltraSharps).Somehow, Dell managed to produce a monitor that both looks good and has no processing latency. Although I was looking for a 2560x1440 or 2560x1600 monitor, there are none that also meet all of my other requirements. Since I'm running a multiple monitor setup (I bought 3 of these), the ultra-thin bezel is also a plus."],["I got this monitor as a replacement for 5 year old Samsung monitor. This monitor works great. Few things to consider before buying the 4 USB ports are placed along with the display connections, making it hard to reach. There is one USB port that is easily accessed. Taking out a star for that. Other than that I do not have any complaints."],["I upgraded from two 5yo Samsung Master 2494HMs (which are solid monitors...for their day).  What attracted me to these particular models were the modern connections, better overall quality of display (IPS), and the sudden drop in price.I had experience at work with Dell monitors and I knew that they are quality, most of the time.  Give this, the U2414H promised to be future proof in terms of connections (DP, HDMI, USB 3.0), and so I bought them without ever physically seeing them. I am glad that I did.In short, I am very pleased with the layout, features, and picture. There are NO dead pixels on either monitor and I was able to calibrate them to be nearly identical in tone, color, and brightness.  This is something I could never achieve with the Samsungs (NOTE: I had to use the sRGB setting and use difference brightness/contrast values to achieve similar colors.  One monitor was yellowish at first, but I was able to eliminate it with the sRGB tweaks. Both are REV A01 with sequential serial numbers).Games looks spectacular with my ATI high-powered card.  Text is crisp and easier to read compared to my Samsungs (that alone was worth the upgrade!).  I had absolutely no issues using the dual DisplayPort outputs and included USB cables.  Everything was detected immediately and displayed properly on the first boot.Finally, it is worth mentioning that the thin bezel and matte finish on these are fantastic. On the older Samsungs the matte was a bit too much as brightness was somewhat of an issue, but on these it is perfect.  Obviously I cannot comment on longevity, but my initial take is that my money was well spent.At $260 a piece these are a great deal, but I doubt the price will stay that low as more and more positive reviews come out (there are several already, but I mean real customers like myself).P.S.  I had considered the older model of this monitor (U2412M).  But it is more expensive and I read in more than one forum that the models being sold now are old Rev A00 that had minor color tone issues (a yellowish hue), and now Dell is now trying to unload them.  I would skip those if you have been looking at them and go with these (if you have DP and do not need DVI).UPDATE 6-18-14: I wanted to warn users about an issue with DisplayPort and dual monitor setups (the issue is not with these awesome monitors as it appears on all that use DP exclusively).  If you use DP for a dual monitor setup, then be warned that turning off your secondary monitor will FORCE all icons, programs to the primary monitor (it makes the monitor invisible to the OS like turning off your printer).  This is an issue with Windows7 and Windows8, regardless of the video card or monitors that you use.  Luckily for me, my video card had a DVI and a HDMI output that I can use.  For some reason using the DVI output (with an HDMI adapter) resolves the issue. I can turn off my secondary monitor without any aberrant behavior.  However, I have read that a dual HDMI output causes the same thing (but there is a physical workaround that appears to the easy, see here: [...]).*****This issue has been known since 2010, but Microsoft refuses to fix it.******In short, if your video card only has DP outputs (or you planned on only using DP), but you want a dual monitor setup, be prepared for the most annoying issue possible with such a setup--and again, this will occur regardless of what brand of monitor you buy.  I am simply writing this since these monitors do not have ANY DVI connections.  Hopefully this will be resolved by Windows9...but I doubt it."],["After taking it out of the box, it's amazing how think the bezel is.  Once turned on, you barely see the bezel and the screen quality is impressive.  Upgraded from the U2212M, and it's a world of difference."],["I was totally amazed by the color performance and its super thin bezel. I'm a photography hobbist, so a monitor with accurate colors is essential to me; at the same time, I really care about the style of the monitor. Dell U2414H fulfills both of my requirements.I connect my Mac to this monitor with a miniDisplay to HDMI adapter + HDMI cable. What's nice is that my 2010 MacBook Pro 15&#34; will output the sound with HDMI, then I can connect my external speakers to the headphone jack at the back of the monitor. Moreover, this monitor has USB 3.0 ports, so I connect my wireless mouse adapter, external hard drive, iPhone cables to the monitor. This makes my desk neat and tidy since I only need to connect a miniDisplay to HDMI adapter and a USB 3.0 cable to my Mac; I can easily take away my Mac for outside use and put it back when I got home.There is one thing you need to know: when u have a Nvidia GPU and connecting via HDMI (even when you use a miniDisplay to HDMI adapter), the video card thinks it's a TV and outputs YCbCr color space, so the colors are kind of washed out. If u google it, you can easily find ways to overcome this. For Mac users, you can follow the link here: http://www.ireckon.net/2013/03/force-rgb-mode-in-mac-os-x-to-fix-the-picture-quality-of-an-external-monitorAfter making my video card to display full RGB color, this monitor looks even better.FYI, there is a &#34;sRGB&#34; preset mode. It is the factory calibrated profile for this monitor. Included in the box is a factory calibration sheet unique to this monitor you get.By the way, it has 100x100 VESA mount, I'm going to mount it to a monitor arm to save some of my desktop space."],["1080P requires a better graphics card (Intel 4600) than I have, but the picture is beautiful. You need a video card that has dedicated memory of 3mb of better.There are some programs where the screen is too large. 1920 x 1080 is not realistic. At that resolution the colors fade out. The smallest screen resolution is 1024 x 768. I use 1360 x 768. I can only use the HDMI port. The monitor does not have a video port. The built-in USB3 ports are a real advantage. If I had to do it again, I would get a 20&#34; or 22&#34; with a video port. The Dell management software is great. The software divides up the screen into windows.

Win8 is horrible and although this system is pretty fast, it does have a tendency to lag.  The fan is louder than I expected...but given the relatively few vents on the case I can understand why.  Great value, a lot of pc for the price."],["I ordered this computer.  I did get it the day they said I would on a Tuesday.  Never could get it to work properly.  So, on the following Sunday I called Dell to see if they could help figure out what was wrong only to find out that it was requistered to someone else.  I ordered a brand new computer and had rec.'d a refurbish computer that Dell said &#34; they could not help me because it was not my computer.  I gave at least 2 stars becausebecause before I was of the Phone with Dell Amazon was calling to give me a return label and said they would credit my account the next day which finally happened Friday.I have since order another computer from Amazon.  We will see how this one does.  I really hope it is new and not used."],["I waited a full month before placing my review because I felt that would give me sufficient amount of time to get to know this new computer.I must say that at first, I  hated the new Windows 8 version and if you look at most of the bad reviews on this pc, it is in regards to the Windows version and not the pc itself. In saying that, I upgraded to Windows 8.1 and then installed Classic Shell, (a third party app for free), which made my new computer function more like Windows 7 and gave me back my start button that I truly missed :) Since then, I will occasionally convert over to the Windows 8 screen and play around while I get more familiar with it, knowing that I can easily go back to the appearance of Windows 7 so I am now happy :)After 1 month of use, I have not heard my fan run at all so I have no idea what some of the previous reviews are talking about there, I guess I am just glad I didn't get a bad one :)I love the large screen!I love the soft keys!The speakers are so loud that most of the time I have them set to about 40%. When I first used the laptop, the speakers were set at 100% and about blew my ears off from another room so I don't think I will ever need to turn them up to that!I don't like not having a back-light for my numbers pad. I can't tell if my numbers pad is locked or not and this is annoying, but not enough to want a different computer.Overall I am very happy with this computer."],["No instructions!  very confusing operations. Can't find half of the stuff I have been using over the last 18 years.I hate Windows 8. Most of the 'F' keys are useless, and their function is changed. Changes should be for improvements. This is going in the WRONG direction! I wish I had never bought this computer. I could NEVER recommend this computer to anyone.I love the speed, and the screen size, but I can't do anything with it. Maybe play games...  I am currently using my old Toshiba, at least I can do something with that!"],["I purchased mine from Costco, not from Amazon, but would like to share what I know about this unit.  This laptop, at its configuration, is a good price.The most significant good things about it are:(1) it runs pretty well, and does not generate too much heat.  The bottom of the unit is only lukewarm after 24 hours of use (one reason being the hard drive is running at only 5400 RPM, not at 7200);(2) it has wired, wireless, and a blue-tooth connections, and an SD memory card reader (good for trasnferring images from cameras);(3) upgrade of memory is very easy, as both memory slots are easily accessible at the bottom (side by side with the laptop hard drive).The bad thing is:You cannot install Windows 7 side by side with Windows 8, or even over it, even after you shrink the size of the C: drive to create a new partition.  The hard drive has two hidden partitions before the C: drive (So C: drive is actually the 3rd partition).  These hidden partitions are storage area for system restore files, and are valuable if you have to restore or recover the system.  But their presence makes attempts to install Windows 7 impossible, until I manually removed all partitions and recreated C: on the first partition.  (Then I was able to install Windows 7, and am running Windows 7 64 bit without any issues.)I am not saying that Windows 8 is bad.  I just wish to use Windows 7 for now.Now, another good thing is with Dell tech support:First, you can find all necessary drivers for Windows 7 (and Windows 8, of course) on their website: support.dell.com;Second, Dell support is usually very good and very quick.  As my system came initially with \"Rapid Response Depot\", I gave them a call Tuesday (6-25-2013) afternoon at 3, telling them (yes, at India) that I had lost Windows 8 and the backup drives in the process of installing Windows 7.  In half an hour, they got the dispatch arrangement ready, and overnight I received the replacement package (to restore Windows 8) via FedEx.  Next, I'll try to see if I can install Windows 8 on a different partition, and run dual-boot (W7 and W8) on this laptop.  Usually you can install a newer OS (W8) side by side with an existing, older OS (W7) and get a dual boot.  Will update when that task is done.  So, for now, I am happy with both the unit, and Dell support.Update 1 (after receiving the 1st replacement package from Dell): It was an 8GB system recovery USB key.  On running it, it successfully restored my hard drive to the factory setting: with hidden EFI drive (this time only one drive) and with the rest of the hard drive as C:.  It gave me back the Windows 8 system that I had lost, but it erased, without warning, the Windows 7 partition that I had painstakingly installed. So, it did the job of system recovery (to factory setting), but sent me back to square one.  I called again today (7-1-2013), explaining what I need is the stand-alone Windows 8 media, by which I can specify where I want to install Windows 8 (on a different partition, so I can have dual boot).  Will update again when the 2nd replacement media arrives.  Calling and getting to a live Dell tech support (yes, they are in India.  I got confirmation two times) took about 5 minutes.  Getting the new dispatch order done took another half an hour.Update 2 (after receiving replacement Windows 8 installation DVD): The replacement package came via FedEx standard overnight, to my pleasant surprise.  Installation of Windows 8 onto a separate partition was easy.  Update of drivers took some time, but was easy too.  I now have dual-boot.  On booting up, the screen gives me the option of either booting into Windows 8, or booting into Windows 7.  I booted into each OS several times, and both OS are running well, without any issues.  End of the story, a happy one."]],"title":"Dell Inspiron 17 i17RV-5455BLK 17.3-Inch Laptop (Black Matte with Textured Finish)","total_reviews":20,"sentiment":0.734075,"label":"positive","best_review":["I great a great deal for a great laptop.i had a small problem with it and call dell fixed it in 5 minutes .it was just a set up issue"]},{"asin":"B004Y0ILC6","brand":"Dell","imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41UopaMUWWL._SX300_.jpg","rating":[4,1,1,3,19],"reviews":[["nice solid keyboard.  used this in lab at school and had to get rid of the crappy one at work.  nice stuff. feels good. much better than the general run of the mill logitech stuff."],["This Dell keyboard is easy to type on, well constructed, and very reasonbly priced.

Other keyboards may be fancier, but it is doubtful they will perform better then this one."],["Why ALL keyboards aren't exactly like this one is beyond me. They had a few of these floating around where I worked, but they were scarce. I had a friend who had one and I really wanted one after trying it. I was friends with one of the tech people, so he managed to get one for me. For 2 years, I love it more than anything. I just changed jobs and unfortuantely, I really didn't want to get in trouble for taking \"company property\" with me, even though odds are they never would have cared or noticed. But regardless, I was very excited to see they still had these for sale here on Amazon seeing as I reluctantly left my work one at work. Most of them around the web are refurbished or used, so to find a new one on here was great!This keyboard will honestly ease your strokes on the keys and is virtually effortless to use. Some computer keyboards, you really have to put some pressure on the keys to really make them work. Not this one, it's perfect. I'm honestly shocked that Dell didn't make a billion more of these. Maybe some people aren't just that fussy about their keyboards like me. But for those of you that are, GET THIS!"],["I stumbled upon this keyboard in storage for one of the companies I worked for. It reminded of the laptop keyboard I'm usually so fond of. It's quiet, but there's a distinct feeling you get when the key is pressed. It's soft and yet it requires more than just the weight of your finger to press the keys down. Key edges are trimmed so you can slide fingers along and hit multiple keys yet the gaps are large enough so you know if you're hitting the wrong key. I program for living and type 10-16 hours a day and this keyboard by far has been my favorite.I've tried all walks of keyboards from cheap wireless keyboards to fancy gaming keyboards with lighting and etc. Bottom line is that 15 years down I keep buying these because they last good 5-6 years before they show any wear. Highly recommend for people who need to type for a long time."],["First, I'd like to say I never write a review for anything.  Not even for things I actually buy and take enjoyment in.  This is my very first one, driven to do so by my experiences with this keyboard.  Perhaps if I can reach other people, and warn them first, they won't be stuck with this keyboard.I have not bought this keyboard, however I am forced to work with it every day at my job in software development.  I have also been able to type 100wpm corrected since I was in high school.  If you use keyboards in any kind of half-serious capacity you should avoid this keyboard like the plague.The shift key on the left is impossibly huge.  It seems just like any other old SHIFT key, but something is up with it.  This is the only keyboard I've _ever_ used where I accidentally hit the shift key instead of the &lt; key on a semi-regular basis (I'm using the German version of this keyboard, which has 1-2 minor differences to the English version, in this case exchange the z with the &lt;).  This probably wouldn't suck so much if i didnt work in development and use such a tag often.  Then you see you didnt open the bracket properly and must go back and correct.If you are a habitual key pounder as you type, be aware that the keyboard has a horribly loud clack to the keys and people will stare (especially when you pound that backspace key).  The wrist-bridge accessory which you can attach to the bottom of the keyboard feels flimsy and shakes and rattles under my wrist.And finally, the best for last.  In addition to being impossibly huge, the shift key will occasionally get STUCK in the down position and not come back up.  Sometimes you didn't even mean to hit it, you just wanted to use the &lt; key.  Sometimes it's stuck and then you hit CAPS LOCK to write out a table name and then you see and have to go back...worst case scenario, its stuck and you begin using your mouse, or using some keyboard shortcuts, which has actually done things to me like clear the contents of the document I am working on, closed my browser with 6 tabs open, and various other little mishaps which perhaps aren't such a big deal until it happens at least 8 times a day.  By the end of the work day, I want to just yank out the USB wires and throw the thing against the wall in my office.I think I have to give it at least one star, so consider that for the handy hotkeys it has, which I like and are useful but are also readily found on most other keyboards.If you are thinking about buying this keyboard for occasional use, or perhaps even as a main keyboard, as you are a casual computer user, then I believe this will be an okay purchase for you.  I'm sure the SHIFT key does not stick on every board or I wouldn't be the first to leave a review here, but the men in my office also accidentally hit it all the time while typing, and you can never get rid of the clack.  If you are someone who types a lot (doing it fast and with feeling) or you are not a casual computer user, stay away.  Maybe this all seems childish and petty to some of you, but some of us are keyboard wizards, and these little things are the kind of things which will begin to instill hatred in your heart for an inanimate object.  Look into another keyboard.  Seriously.  KEYBOARD OF HATRED."],["I had to chime in when I saw a 4-star rating for this keyboard. First, I must mention that I'm way more pickier than the average user when it comes to keyboards or any electronic gadgetry for that matter. I was using this keyboard at work for well more than a year. When I first set my eyes on it, it seemed like my dream keyboard: sleek looks, flat and quiet keys, the works. But appearances can be deceptive. This thing is way more noisy than you'd imagine. In fact, it reminded me of the keyboards from the 90s, the ones where you'd need to hammer the keys to enter text. The Alt key in particular is very annoying, most of the time I'd find myself using extra force to do an Alt-Tab or a Ctrl-Alt-Del. For some reason, my fingers just never jived with this keyboard....it used to take me longer to type something on this keyboard than on my laptop.I finally gave up and got a KB522 instead....it feels way better. Do yourself a favor and do the same."],["This keyboard has several design flaws which I will outline here.1. Amount of force needed to press the keys is too high. This causes the user to pound the keys.2. Keyboard seems to miss double leters effectively. Probably caused by #1 above. >>>Notice that I left a letter out of 'letters' in the sentence before. That was not on purpose!&lt;&lt;&lt; I hit 'l' two times, but only got one. Hapens al the time unless I POUND the double letters intentionally. And again, the missed leters here ('Hapens', 'al') are hapening naturally.3. The keyboard is very loud and clacky as another reviewer mentioned. Probably caused by #1 above. I sit near a person at work that uses this keyboard and it is LOUD. She said her fingers have gotten stronger since using this keyboard, probably because she has to pound the keys. I'm actually considering buying her another keyboard out of my own pocket... Here at home, as I type this, I'm two rooms away from my sleeping wife, and I'm actually wondering if my typing will wake her up.4. They keys are recessed in a flush enclosure that has a rigid rim around the base of the keys. If you accidentally hit the edge of the left shift key for example, you'll hit the rigid edge, which is at the same elevation, and miss the shift. This is the first such keyboard I've ever used with this design peculiarity. I now know why keyboard keys should be raised instead of recessed into a flush case.On a positive note, it looks good. So if you are going for looks only, this is the keyboard for you."],["I came across this keyboard where I work and liked it so much I decided to purchase one to use at home.This is a slim form factor keyboard, and as such it is NOT one of Dell's quietkey keyboards so it is a bit louder when you type. That being said, this keyboard is quieter and has much sturdier keys (they don't wobble) than any other keyboard of the same form factor that I have used.It also has what are in my opinion some of the best thought out media keys I have ever encountered - they are well positioned for quick use without accidental clicks, don't stand out from the rest of the keyboard, and perhaps most importantly all the ones I want are there without any of the usual extras that I don't use.This was easily the best under $20 purchase I have ever made for my computer."],["No drivers needed, just plugged it in and all the multimedia integrated with the Windows default components.

At first I thought their out of place location was going to bug me, but I don't use them nearly as much as I used to so I'm forgiving them that.  Used to I wouldn't buy a keyboard that didn't have the big L shaped Enter key - which this one doesn't - but I've come to accept the fact they just don't make them like that anymore.

Weighs a ton and getting a bag forIt can be difficult.Loving it though."],["If you want high-end desktop performance in a transportable package, it doesn't get any better than this. And I use the word &#34;transportable&#34; deliberately - the Alienware 18 is too big and heavy to be truly a laptop or notebook.You lose big time on size and portability with this machine, but gain almost everywhere else:Display: For graphic design and production art, which is what I use it for, the 18.4&#34; panel is gorgeous. It easily beats my previous MacBook Pro 17&#34; on all fronts - brightness, contrast ratio, RGB gamut, color accuracy and viewing angle. Theoretically, a higher resolution than 1920x1080 would be desireable for an 18.4&#34; panel like this - the MacBook Pro Retina is already way higher, as are a couple of Dell's XPS models. However, if you're a user of Windows and Adobe Creative Suite like me, there's a problem with going any higher than 1920x1080. Currently, the likes of Photoshop and InDesign cannot upscale their UIs for these ultra-high DPI panels - you either have to suffer working with miniscule UI elements, or reduce resolution to make them big enough to read (and thus negating the advantage of a high-DPI panel). When choosing this machine, I decided on practicality over bragging rights.Chassis/Build quality: It's good, very good, but ultimately still a Dell at heart. The metal chassis elements make it very rigid and solid, but there's still a lot of plastic there - too much for it to truly equal a MacBook Pro or a high-end Sony VAIO, at least in terms of that &#34;premium&#34; look and feel. The rubber coating on the plastic chassis elements is also flawed - due to the weight of the machine, the corners tend to rub hard on all they meet, especially inside a backpack, and the coating wears off in these spots (in my case it took a day). I have a $30 case for my Nokia phone with a similar rubberized coating which still hasn't worn off in 4 months of hard use, and years ago I had an IBM ThinkPad T-series with the same exterior finish that took probably a year of hard abuse to wear off to this extent. OK, this is strictly cosmetic, but really, Dell?In terms of weight, forget this if you want something you can easily carry around. The computer itself weighs twice as much as your average 17&#34; desktop replacement laptop, and the power supply brick alone weighs more than a MacBook Air we have lying around the house. Enough said.Ergonomics/Design: The first thing I did was turn off all the external LED lighting except the keyboard, which transforms the machine from a 70s discotheque into an understated black monolith. The keyboard itself is full-size, the action and tactility is better than just about any other laptop I've used, and the programmable macro keys at the far-left and above the numeric keypad make good use of the huge available space. And that space really is enormous - the palmrest resembles the deck of an aircraft carrier, but this causes one small gripe - why isn't the trackpad WAY bigger? It's not like there's no room for it!The height of the machine is also considerable - think two or even three regular laptops stacked on top of each other. I can see why some people would complain about the lower edge of the machine being too high and no, it's not ideal, but I got used to it in less than a day. It's not bad, just different, especially if like me you're used to super-slimline laptops.Performance: Insane. I went for the dual NVIDIA GTX 770m model, and immediately upgraded it with a 256MB mSATA flash drive and a second 750GB 7200rpm SATA disk. This beats the high-end the Xeon-powered, Quadro graphics-equipped desktop workstation I recently used in the office hands-down. It just doesn't feel most of the tasks you throw at it. The only thing that makes it break sweat is Crysis 3, and I installed this essentially out of curiosity to see how much it could take - it's only a game. For general productivity and destop publishing work, the Alienware 18 rivals all but the most expensive workstations.One small negative point is that due to the NVIDIA cards being SLI you can't switch from them to the integrated Intel HD 4600 graphics without a reboot, but it's hardly a deal-breaker.Noise/heat: As quiet as any laptop I've used. Even with both of those 770m cards working at full tilt, it's surprisingly quiet, and the fans kick in quickly when needed and then just as rapidly spin down when the load is reduced. People have reported problems here with the latest A06 BIOS update, but I've yet to experience any. In terms of heat, it gets warm, but just that - never hot or anything close. When you're using the Intel graphics and just messing about on the Internet or using Office, it's almost completely silent.Overall: If you're willing to sacrifice weight, size, and most importantly price, to get the ultimate in performance, look no further. If The Alienware 18's attributes in these areas are just too much for your taste or needs, then look elsewhere. For me, however, it's pretty much ideal."],["Very powerful. Very reliable. Great buy.

You should consider getting the Alienware 17 or 14.  If you want something that can last a long time without having to worry about upgrading the video card in the future, then get this laptop.Two things worth upgrade when getting this laptop:1) 16GB Memory- Make sure you get the 1.35V volts.  If you get the 1.5V, the laptop will not boot up.  One thing to note:  It's kind of difficult to upgrade the memory on this laptop.  You'll have to take out many parts in order to swap out the old memory.  I would recommend just get another 8GB (2 x 4GB) of the original Alienware 18 Memory.  It'll be a lot easier to just put another 8GB of memory into system to make it 16GB.2) SSD Hard Drive- Very Easy Installation.

But then the Video Cards crashed...

And when I was trying to register online had an error about my device being already registered. Their support rep transferred the call and after 30 minutes a guy who cant help me picks up the phone saying that he is going to transfer me to the right person. and then he hangs the phone...I called again and had to escalate with a supervisor in order to get anything done, bottom line it took them a week after that call to get the device under my name.I fixed the video cards issue by myself, but they still flicker form time to time, I tried everything and the only way to resolve this is by rebooting the system... As of now I just hope the device lasts and that the issue is a driver problem and not hardware. I really don't want to rely on Alienware support anymore."],["This is one hefty, powerful piece of machinery.  With the large screen and its 20 pound weight, you are really getting a &#34;Mobile Desktop&#34; more than a laptop, but it is fast and beautiful to look at.  Windows 8 comes to life so quickly I think I'm dreaming.  The size of the laptop gives ample room to space out the keys on the keyboard to a more typical keyboard spacing rather than the cramped layout of your standard laptop.  Hooked it up to an HDTV with and HDMI cable and enjoyed great resolution and fast streaming of movies and TV shows.  I've been remiss in putting it through its paces on the &#34;hardcore gaming&#34; front, but I have kids that are ready to put it to the test.  Anything less taxing (would that be &#34;softcore&#34;??) works wonderfully and the load time for the Office suite I loaded is so minimal I can't believe how easy multitasking is.  The built in speakers aren't bad at all and offer a big jump from any other laptops I've owned.  I'd say if you're looking for a portable laptop - look elsewhere, but if you're a gamer that just needs to lug this to and from and have solid power and performance once in place - this is a machine to strive for."],["Totally what my son anted for Christmas.He was so happy.  Ready for gaming and college work.  Seems very impressive"],["EDIT - DO NOT BUY! Dell support is horrible!!! Two motherboards switched out, Only Indian support staff that is almost impossible to understand. If you buy through amazon they make you go through a 30 minute registration through dell when you call to try and get help. It took me over 30 minutes just to get a hold of the \"registration\" representative to register my computer with dell, even though I had previously done that online. If you really want this computer be aware that dell does not know how to fix an issue with the integrated graphics card, and that they don't like you if you shop on amazon.This is my first alienware computer. I used to be a desktop guy, built my own desktop and put in the latest stuff and got great results. How ever I can't do that with a laptop so after having dell, acer, asus and mac that performed well below what I was looking for I found this one.Amazing build quality - I opened it up the other day to add extra memory and an SSD and then I saw how well this machine is built and how expandable it is, room for 2 hdd and 4 memory slots makes this fairly upgradable from a laptop standpoint. The 18 inch screen sits steady on some really nice and tight hinges and never moves even when I am walking it around the house.Power - This thing is a beast. I do a lot of photoshop, illustrator, autocad, maya work and this thing never stalls ***thats a lie**** It stalled on me once last week when opening up a 5 gb illustrator file. I could however work on the file without any problems after I opened it. I rarely play video games but since I got a \"gaming\" computer I had to have some fun. I played battlefield 4 on highest setting and was still getting 120-130 fps without any problems. And the fans on the graphics card never go up to maximum speed unless I'm playing battlefield or using some heavy 3d rendering.Looks - It looks like a beast! All the lights are really cool and handy when I work in the dark. How ever I got bored of the lights really fast and they are easy to turn off.Cons -  Very few, how ever I hate the power brick. The cable is as thick as a jumper cable and when I sit in my couch working it falls out every time I make a move. The battery life is incredibly limited but by switching to an onboard graphic and lowering the screen brightness it works for about 2 hours. The macro keys to the left of the keyboard don't work in any game that I have tried them in, could be a user error, so I am no fan of those for gaming but I did put in shortcuts for all my work related software on those keys and it speeds my workflow up a bit.All in all I love it! Alienware customer for life!"],["Everything comes together with the Alienware 18. Display is crisp and color-rich, design is restrained cool, and build quality is near perfect. Best laptop I have ever used or looked inside of."],["Our son got this for his birthday and he was amazed. It was a great gift for a soon to be college student who enjoys gaming. Gaming crashes normal computers, but this computer has it all for a gamer."],["So powerful but too havey. But good enough for me though.U will know how strong it is after you tried it."],["Let me start my stating that this is only the second laptop I have had experience with so my review will be from the perspective of a novice user.  Aesthetically, it seems strange to describe a laptop as 'imposing' but that was exactly my impression upon unboxing it!  It is bigger and heavier than my Asus laptop with a silver-anodized aluminum finish that give it an almost futuristic look.  The OS is Windows 8, which starts up considerably faster than my other laptop.  The HD screen display is honestly the best I've seen on any laptop or PC for that matter.  Bold, rich colors and deep blacks.  Browsing the net on this laptop almost felt like a new experience even when going to familiar sites simply because of the stunning resolution.  And the keyboard felt just right for my rather thick fingers, which usually tend to trip over one another given the close proximity of the key spacing on most laptops.  A small bonus, but one I was grateful for.  Another nice touch was way the lighting for the keyboard could be adjusted to different colors.  Not necessarily a practical feature, but one that illustrates Alienware's dedication to a fully pleasurable experience for the user.  I am not an avid gamer so I cannot fully elaborate on the extent of this laptop's performance, but I had no issues with any of the games that I played.  Absolutely no slowness or glitch during my many hours of gameplay.  Given that this was built specifically for the hardcore gamer, it will more than hold up to the average amount of gameplay.  Another feature worth mentioning is that, even after hours of usage, this Alienware laptop did not feel hot to the touch.  It was slightly warm but nothing that caused discomfort or agitation if it really did rest on one's lap.  This came as a pleasant surprise given its size and capabilities, .  Overall, this is an incredibly designed laptop that lives up to everything it promises.  But given the high price range, it is clearly suited for the more intense gamers, who should find this more than worthy of purchasing."],["The Alienware 18 is an extremely powerful gaming PC packed into a laptop. Every component in this computer works together seamlessly to create an immersive experience for every PC game out there. It can run games displaying far superior graphics than the next generation consoles, and it is also a fully functional computer. The Alienware 18 enables you to play any game to its full potential without having any concern about whether the laptop can handle it. The laptop is massive, for it is essentially the power of a top of the line gaming rig designed for portability. It&#8217;s perfect if you want to be able to take the full PC gaming experience with you on travels, or over to a friend&#8217;s house for example. Due to the great cooling system, even when playing an intensive game, the laptop is very quiet and cool. Also, the anodized-aluminum finish and the lights make it look awesome, like a device from the future. It&#8217;s a little heavier than I would have wished, but that is the price you pay for unparalleled performance. The build quality is sturdy, and every inch appears very well made. To put it simply, this is the king of all laptops when it comes to gaming and computing performance.Not only can this laptop play games flawlessly, but it also comes with many other noteworthy features. It is customizable so that you can change the color of the lights under the keyboard and on the sides and back. The built in software &#8220;Alienware Command Center&#8221; makes this and many other things easy to do, such as setting custom actions to certain macro keys. The keyboard works great for gaming, the keys feel responsive and the track pad is positioned in just the right place and is also rather customizable. The HD display is beautiful, and it even has support for HDMI input so that you could use the screen as a display for other devices. You can also plug it into an HDTV via an HDMI cord and stream it if you want to play on a bigger screen. Plus, if mouse and keyboard gaming isn&#8217;t for you, there are plenty of USB ports to attach a controller and you can have your own personal &#8220;more than next-gen consoles&#8221; video game experience. Overall, it is a very versatile laptop, it has all of the standard ports and features that good laptops come with. The microphones and camera on this laptop have especially good quality, and the sound system is state of the art (and plenty loud).It comes with Windows 8, which allows for extremely quick startup times. It comes with a driver disc, however most of the drivers are already pre-installed. Because this is an extremely powerful laptop, everyday computer programs run exceedingly quickly and smoothly. The Intel i7 processor makes this possible. Also, the 8 gigabytes of DDR3 RAM makes multi-tasking easy for your computer even when running games. The laptop also allows for much customizing when it comes to battery usage, although when playing the most intensive games I recommend being plugged in.Every game that I tested can run on the highest settings with 60 frames per second at the HD resolution 1920 x 1080, or 1080p. This is possible because of the not only one, but TWO Nvidia GTX 770M graphics cards in this laptop. To put this in perspective, graphics cards are the most important components in gaming PCs. The two next generation consoles are modeled after gaming PCs, and they both have a graphics card. A single Nvidia GTX 770M is more powerful than the graphics cards in either of the new consoles, and this laptop has two of them. With this power, this laptop can run the newest games on the highest settings, and this laptop will without a doubt be able to keep up with new games for years to come."]],"title":"Alienware 18 ALW18-3002sLV 18-Inch Gaming Laptop","total_reviews":17,"sentiment":0.7550117647,"label":"positive","best_review":["Very powerful.

So happy sitting here using it that even work that I have been neglecting and procrastinating over is getting done. I love the display quality and though i didn't realise I was getting a matte finish and not glossy I have nooooooo regrets matter of fact I think its the better of the two. The ability to rotate the monitor to portrait was THE selling point. It works beautifully though it takes some getting used to. Its also easy to do. With none of the adjustments do you have to press a button or release anything just pull up and down, or twist the base or rotate the display. Calibrating for your preference is great in that you have presets that you can choose from depending on movie, text, standard, etc etc. OR which is soooo cool you can predetermine in what preset you want to use for which ever software you are using so you don't have to manual change. So once I am using a movie player it switches, if I am using my graphic software it switches. Love that!! The only thing I think others might mind but i don't is that it takes up more space that than most monitors today. The face/display itself is thin enough but the way in which it is connected to the stand has such a gap that it takes up space. But its a none issue for me.

The reasons I took off a star will beunnoticeable/non-issues to the vast majority of people. I bought the P2214Hfor someone else, and they are completely happy with it.However, in my reviews I factor in both value-for-the-dollar as wellas my personal desires irrespective of price considerations.For the $180 I paid? Impressive. I didn't think I could get an IPSwith an adjustable stand at this price. And I was glad to see thatthe extreme graininess of older IPS monitors has been greatlyreduced.Good:Not hideously grainy-looking like older IPS monitors. Good,adjustable stand. Low input lag (important for gaming). Easy-to-usemenus thanks to physical buttons that sit adjacent to theirrespective OSD functions.Bad:Though the &#34;custom color&#34; mode's default settings are spot-on(according to Lagom), photos do not look as natural as they do on myASUS TN (TN is just a different type of LCD) from 2009, which wassurprising since TN is an older, cheaper LCD technology, and is supposedto have inferior color quality relative to IPS. But this is not dueto any kind of defect with the Dell. I looked into it and found outwhy my old ASUS has better color: the backlight. The ASUS uses a CCFL(long, thin glass tube) backlight with a wider color gamut than theLED backlight found in the Dell. This is actually typical of LEDbacklights versus CCFL backlights (found almost exclusively in oldermonitors). Still, it was a real disappointment, as I'd been hopingfor better color, not worse. My one big negative.Not bad for gaming, partly due to the rock-bottom input lag, but notas good as gaming-oriented TN monitors. I noticed more motion blur onthis than my ASUS. But that was expected as IPS is designed forgreater overall image quality, and not specifically gaming.Higher refresh rates would be appreciated. This is actually ashortcoming of every monitor out there not marked &#34;120hz&#34; or &#34;144hz&#34;.I was able to overclock the Dell to 70hz but that was it, and itcompletely broke video playback on some websites due toincompatibility with content protection standards. I can't fault Dell forthis however because it's an industry-wide problem.

You can even tell it to turn off the power indicator light while on - nice feat- Enough options in the menus, fairly easy to set up - and then you can forget about it, because everything is to satisfaction.- A LOT of adjustability in height and it pivots a bit (it goes vertical as well, which I don't use). Stable foot, you can't really tilt it accidentially.- Excellent value for money- Power use is very low (for me ~16 watt, calibrated - see bottom of review)Dislike:- When unplugging DVI cable, the panel power timeout is set to 5 minutes - why not 1 minute? This option can't be changed.- As is common with IPS displays, there's a bit of backlight bleeding on black backgrounds.

First off, the computer I was used to was an older Dell (about the size of a bus! I saw the box for this and was wondering if I had ordered something in error. This baby is tiny! Maybe slightly bigger than an old-school photo album!After plugging it in and breezing through the setup, I was really looking forward to testing the \"negative\" stuff I had read.

After fumbling around for a bit with it, I picked up navigating and searching through most everything. It's setup simply put, like a smart phone. You can search anything and everything on the sidebar (after you figure where it is, LOL!) I have since then tested the processor speed, especially on the internet. I have DSL, and clicking on the Internet Explorer symbol will get me to homepage between 1-2 seconds. I, all at once, linked up my iTunes (sharing and importing my music from my old computer- roughly 16GB of music), was on the net, and downloading updates, etc. all with minimal trouble with processor & speed. If anything, the only thing I've noticed that was somewhat time consuming was starting the computer up. It takes literally a minute or two max! It was a little bit slower than my laptop which is an Intel i7 processor. Unless you're dealing with 3-D CAD/CAM programming software, I doubt you'll have any issues with processor speed.Some other negatives I read were not being able to locate the USB ports and the CD/DVD drive. Really now? If you look at the pics here on Amazon, you will see BOTH buttons to release the USB cover AND DVD drive! I actually thought I wasn't going to be able to link up my 5.1 surround to this when I looked at the inputs in the back, but plugging the 3 wires in (using headphone, mic, and another jack) prompted a pop-up on the computer in which the computer read what the wire was for, and allowed me to select it for my surround!

After working with it for a while, I don't think it is difficult, but it definitely is different, and you have to learn where things are for this System. For those Windows XP users that might be intimidated, there are still Windows 7 computers available (I believe there are fewer compatibility issues). However, going forward, lack of compatibility will only be increasing, so I decided to bite the bullet now, and get new software and hardware as necessary for this current environment.

They look great and sport a beautiful design, as pictured obviously. The picture is great HD quality, text looks clear and easy to read. No complaints for the picture quality or the deepness of the blacks in the picture- perfect all the way. Case design is sleek and clean.The issues I do have are with the glass faced monitor itself. I knew this going in, but didn't think it would be as distracting as it is. With the glass face on the monitor it can be like looking in the mirror at yourself as you sit there in front of your screen, especially on a black screen or dark screen. There is pretty bad glare if there is any light in the room. As this is part of the design, I get it, but again, I didn't think it would be as bad as it is. After you work for a while and as you use a white background (instead of a dark or black background) you notice it less.Also, these monitors do not mount on a bar or on the wall. If you are looking for that feature, these monitors are not for you.I don't regret the purchase, but something to think about if you are planning on buying these monitors."],["I am coming from a iMac with 21.5\" display.  However, I had to get rid of that as my employer gave me a laptop.  I was looking for a good monitor to hook it up to and picked this up from a local retailer.  In the store it looked great but when I got it home I was disappointed that text on it is quite blurry.  Now I realize that my previous monitor was 1920x1080 as is this, but at the smaller size the pixels were closer together, making it sharper.  But I did not think 2.5\" would make that much of a difference.  Perhaps I'm spoiled by the displays on tablets, phones and laptops these days but this is going to have to go back and be traded for a 21.5\" or maybe 23\".  There are some good things about the monitor thought.  Summary:Pro's:Easy SetupSlim FrameHDMI and VGA inputsDecent colorGood for movies, possibly gamingCon's:Not IPS as claimed - and it showsNo height adjustment -  which is even more important on non-IPS displaysText is blurry (at about 2 1/2 feet from monitor)Unfortunately, monitors have not really gotten on the high-res or \"retina\" train yet.  If you want to get a 2560x1440 resolution you have to get a monitor that is at least 27\"...at least that's the smallest I could find.  Having a monitor that is 1080p like your TV (1920x1080) sounds all well and good but we sit much, much closer to our computer monitors than our TVs.  A 24\" at 2560x1440 would be superb but I don't see that coming anytime soon."],["This is a great monitor. It looks very professional and displays an awesome image. Out of the box you need to turn up the brightness and contrast to see what this thing can really do. The HDMI connection is great for that truly digital quality. I'm using this monitor with a Late 2013 MacBook Pro and it plugs directly into the HDMI port. Its as simple as that."],["This monitor came with one of the computers we recently ordered and everyone loved how crisp the graphics are, so we all wanted one.  We ended up buying several more.  The images are crisp and clear - makes it so much easier to read when you're staring at a computer screen for most of the day.  No troubles with any of them so far."],["When I saw this monitor on Amazon for $199, I knew I couldn't pass this up. I recieved the monitor today and came in perfect condition. The box wasn't damaged and neither was the monitor. It took about 30 seconds to set up considering there is only 1 screw and then the monitor just slides into place which is nice. The glossy screen is very reflective but isn't as noticeable when the monitor is being used unless there are bright lights near it. Of course I have an nvidia graphics card so I had to change my settings to get the best color which was very simple to do, I believe I achieved this in less than 5 clicks. I upgraded from a VW224U which was a 22'' ASUS monitor with a max resolution of 1600x1050. This monitor is a huge upgrade not only in size but also in picture quality. It may not be an IPS panel, but it sure looks like one. I personally love the shiny glass screen because it looks similar to the iMac display but is only a quarter of the price. Great buy!!"],["I wanted it as my second monitor.I planned to have a multi monitor display.I thought it would be a great addition.The monitor was great in the dark.But if you are anywhere near light it is exactly a mirror.Lot of times I felt hard to see anything on the screen.On the weekend I spend most of my time on the computer.Sometimes I was scared to see me in the monitor.Had to return it."],["love it dont hesitate buy it now good color nice size small bezel i would buy again  dell is a good brand."],["If you are okay with the glass front that can cause quite a glare you will be very pleased with this monitor.  Crisp, good color (with some tweaking)and overall excellent quality with photos and text.  One odd thing I haven't been able to find a way to correct - the display is slightly larger than the borders of the screen.  that means the scroll bar is slightly more narrow and on Windows 8 the upper right \"X\" is cut off about 1/4 from the top.  I have no doubt this is a Windows 8 issue and not the monitor's....we all know how quirky new Windows systems are :-)  Would definitely buy this monitor again. The only reason I am giving this a 4 and not 5 is the glare issue is a bit annoying sometimes and the monitor doesn't seem to quite calibrate to Windows 8."],["I bought this monitor for $199 from Best Buy, which is an outstanding price.  For a while, this item was listed for $199 on Amazon as well.  Now that the price is back up, it's no longer a steal, but it's still very competitively priced for a name-brand LED monitor.Some reviewers here have stated that this monitor isn't really IPS.  I'm not an expert when it comes to monitors, but regardless, this monitor performs terrifically, IPS or not.  (It's also worth noting that when looking this model up on Dell's website, there is no mention of IPS in the product description).  I was initially interested in an IPS monitor because of viewing angle issues.  I can say that this monitor looks excellent from all viewing angles.  From very extreme angles, there is a tinge of color distortion, but it's so little that the average user would never even notice.  Colors are very rich and blacks are very dark.  I haven't had a chance to do a lot of gaming or video playback on it, but from the limited experiences I have had, motion seems good, without any blur.Set up was a breeze with this thing.  No tools are required to put the stand together.  Also, reports of the stand being \"wobbly\" are mostly exaggerated.  The base is extremely durable, the small amount of \"wobble\" is going to be the same as any other widescreen flat panel monitor.  And although I was initially worried about the glossy screen, it's a total non-issue.  Now that I have it, I don't want to go back to a matte screen.  This monitor looks really, really good.  The surface doesn't look like cheap glossy plastic, it actually looks like (maybe is?) a sheet of glass.  With that said, fingerprints and scratches would probably be an issue, so this might not be the best choice if kids are going to be nearby :).The only real downside to this monitor is the connection options.  You get HDMI and VGA.  Personally, I would have really liked a DVI port instead of VGA, but for this price, its hard to be too demanding.  You'll probably want to make sure your computer has HDMI output before getting this monitor, from what I've heard, VGA cables can tend to distort color with age and use.Overall, get it, it's a great monitor.  I'm probably going to get a second one for a dual-monitor setup when the price drops, and I'll definitely be buying it from Amazon this time."],["Very nice and elegant looking monitor. It's glossy but it doesn't bother me much, I use it with my MacBook Retina laptop and it works just fine. Didn't have to install the drivers as Mac identified it as Dell S2440L external monitor quickly and showed me all the display options available. The glossy glass on the monitor runs from edge to edge and it has much thinner bezels. No dead pixels, no color leaks whatsoever. Unlike other reviewers I do not see any issue with the viewing angles and internal reflection on the glass (if you notice any such thing then I am pretty sure you may have gotten a lemon, which you must replace ASAP). It has touch control buttons which makes it way easier to operate as opposed to hardware buttons and the buttons are conveniently located on the right bezel, I simply love it.The only cons are the position and lack of enough ports. The position of the ports will make a quick change difficult and you would have to tilt the whole monitor to reach the ports, but you wouldn't need to do this frequently in a desktop setting anyways. Also keep in mind that you can only tilt the monitor to certain angles and that is adjustable to certain extent however, the height is not adjustable.Highly recommended for Mac products like Macbook, Mac Mini or Mac Pro and I am sure it will work beautifully with Windows devices too."],["I purchased the Dell S2440L directly from Dell, but since I buy a lot from Amazon, I thought I would put up a review of this new Dell S2440LI loved the pictures online but in real life this Monitor looks amazing and very elegant and modern.I purchased this Dell Monitor for my 2011 Mac Mini via HDMI.I wanted to get the Apple Thunderbolt Display but I could not justify the $999 price, I know it has a higher resolution and it is IPS but still its a lot of moneySo I said, I will go ahead and try this Dell and see how I like it.I love the design of the monitor and finally the front is glass just like Apple's Monitor and Laptops :-)I am using this Monitor via HDMI from my Mac Mini, and all I can say is WOW!! Amazing beautiful picture and the colors are wonderful.I have one advice to everyone, use a high quality HDMI cable from your Mac, or PC, or XBOX, etc. and you wont be getting any flickering or problems.I always believed that a good Audio or Video cable will get you the best results.Spend at least $35 to $50 on an HDMI and this monitor will blow you away.I could not be happier with this item and I will buy its bigger 27\" brother in the new year :-)Amazing Monitor especially for the price and the stand is also the best I have used, very stable and looks great.My Mac experience went up alot because of this product and Thanks Dell for finally making an amazing Monitor which is also frameless which helps a lot when cleaning the screen :-)Go buy one, and you will be amazed, just use a great HDMI cable and your set.Well worth the $229 asking price. Dell for sure is back in business because it is the best Monitor on the market except the Apple Thunderbolt Display is better, but for $999 it better be!!Happy Shopping :-)Emo"],["Fantastic deal!!!  One of the best products I have purchased in a long time.  Great resolution and ease of set up:-)"],["Went to Best Buy.  This monitor stood out to me as the best monitor on the shelf.  Very nice monitor."],["Monitors are pretty much a commodity now.  So there's not much point is spending huge amounts of money on one.  This is a large, bright, and beautiful 24\" monitor.  What I especially like is the edge-to-edge monitor glass which makes it very elegant and expensive-looking. All the other monitors I considered had a thick 1/2 inch to 1 inch plastic frame/bezel around the glass.  So its price (under 200 bucks) and appearance were the chief selling points for me.Also, the picture of the monitor on Amazon does not quite look right, and I'm not sure why.  It's difficult to tell the glass is edge-to-edge.  The actual monitor is actually much more better looking than it appears on Amazon.  For much better pictures, go to Dell's website and search for \"S2440L\"."],["Beautiful monitor at a great price, just like it's big brother the S2740L - which I own two of.  Unfortunately, Dell in their infinite wisdom have decided that this monitor doesn't deserve the VESA mount that pretty much the whole rest of the world uses, so it won't work with your existing monitor arm.  I ended up returning the two of these I bought to pair with my 27&#34; S2740L monitors."],["I am very happy with this Dell product!  I love the size and the automatic adjustment screen resolution so I do not have to get involved each time!"],["This is not Amazon's fault!  Dell is incorrectly listing this an IPS Monitor.  I'me returning mine.  If you want the IPS monitor, you should purchase the Dell S2340M.Amazon needs to change their listing ASAP"],["I made the plunge back into a dual-monitor setup and now have two 24\" Dell monitors.  My trusty old 16:10 Dell E248WFP and now the S2440L.  I've been a fan of matte screens for a long time, so I was leery about getting a glossy screen.  I'm happy to say my fear was misplaced.Fortunately, this setup is in my basement so glare is not a problem.  I've seen pictures of this monitor in a sunny windowed room, and reflection is definitely a problem there, but for my application the S2440L is wonderful.  I'm actually starting to like it better than the old matte screen, though both together are awesome.  The OSD controls are a joy to work with, and the colors were perfect without a stitch of adjustment beyond a brightness tweak.Awesome monitor!"],["I've had the monitor for 24 days and here are my thoughts:I like the controls on the front of the monitor. It's a good size and not too heavy. Can tilt, but no height adjustment. Nice picture.My only complaint - it is that it is way too reflective - like a tablet screen.In a lit room or daytime with a dark background, you can see yourself in the monitor.If you turn the monitor off, you can clearly see a logo on a shirt from 2 feet away - it's that bad.I play games that have dimly lit areas and reflections cause the game to be almost unplayable until the sun goes down and no lights are on.If reflections annoy you, try another monitor."],["This is the perfect size for viewing two pages side by side which is what I needed for arranging music. The whole family loves all the extra space for everything else too! Also love the bright glass screen:-)"],["The monitor is sharp and the whites are really good.The only complaint, it's so reflective that when it is off, it's a pretty good mirror.What that means is the white bookshelf I have behind me is clearly reflected off the screen and is a big distraction.What makes it worse is my desk is next to a window so I'm well lit up as well.No, I don't need to see my chest when I type.Got the monitor on offer as part of a desktop package, now I know why!"],["This is a wonderful monitor, specially for the price.I work on a Mac, but did not want to pay the price of an apple monitor.The first one they sent did not work properly, it kept shutting off, and I spent a lot of time troubleshooting it. I bought an apple adapter, thinking that was the problem. But when I finally realized something was wrong with it, I was able to return it with no hassles. They sent me a new one, and it works beautifully.Okay, adding to this review months later. It definitely does not work with a Mac mini. I have gone through tech support with both Apple and Dell. It turns out it flickers with my Mac, at first just once in a while. Now, it is a daily, hourly, occurring nuisance. It gets so bad, I cannot work. So while it is a good monitor, just not for a Mac.Sorry if anybody bought one to go with their Mac."],["I agree with all of the other positive comments up to this date. This is my first IPS panel and was pretty shocked to see graphics and background detail that didn't even show on my previous LED (which was not crappy).Cons: The auto brightening feature works well enough but takes some getting used to if you want to use it. Also, I have had the monitor refuse to wake up twice in two weeks and unplugging and replugging did not work. Required a computer reboot. I don't think it's my video card or computer as my previous monitor (also HDMI) did not do this. Not a big deal if it doesn't get worse.Finally, I feel this monitor is well worth the extra few dollars for the IPS especially if you want to upgrade your monitor size anyway.Update: Thirteen months after purchase the inside of the monitor glass is fogging up. It comes and goes and moves around to different places every day. Very weird. Monitor is in an air conditioned office and always has been. I kept windexing the glass until I realized it was inside. Felt Dopey. Monitor is useable but annoying."],["amazing screen and amazing price the clarity is amazing I have a gaming comp and I wanted a screen that could keep up! this is it ladies and gents this is it!"],["I guess it comes down to personal preference and purpose.  I use it strictly for work and not for gaming or movies, so if all you are doing is using it to stare at large Excel spreadsheets....don't buy this monitor.  I have used it for video streaming and it is great in a dark room.  The screen is WAY TOO REFLECTIVE ....PERIOD.  I'll probably end up selling this and doing better research next time."],["This monitor is considered to be one of the most eco-friendly in the world... At 0% brightness and 50% contrast the display is bright enough for me. For some reason when I buy a display I first test how fast it takes to turn on... a display I had before turned on and did not display a menu item on startup... just turned on and off in less than a second. This one is the best I could find to simulate that of my older display but displays the source info-which they should get rid off or put to the bottom right corner.Now that I got more educated on display technology after owning an acer h226hql and finding grey fogging on the vertical axis on that one, I have come to decide that this monitor is currently the best in the market.... 6 MS respond times though are lacking... as there are better displays but aren't as good looking as this one. The thing that attracted me to this display was the edge to edge glass design. It's made to be minimalist like the Apple TB display however this display has 6 MS respond times that make it better than the Apple TB display. If this display was remade to be 2560x1440 at 144 hertz and 1 ms respond times I would buy it... immediately.Color gamut wise... this display has excellent levels of deep blacks for the technology used VA LED instead of IPS. The display is much much darker than my older ones... however it is not OLED and it allows you to still see through the pixels in dark scenes - a perfect combo until QD-LED's start to replace IPS for the color gamut to be greater. The colors are moderately cool, which is perfectly normal as you can tune them with brightness to your likings - however the contrast decreases as you increase the brightness so they built a brightness auto setting which you can turn on if you please to do so that changes when you see a white image... the brightness goes up... when you see something dark it goes down.Cons- The model I bought has a slight backlight bleed into the displays edges... I find it kinda cool though. It feels like it's a  holographic effect... not a downgrade like when displays have a giant blotch of brightness scattered into one zone. This type of brightness leakage is one straight faded white line across the top of the display horizontally not big enough to see from far away but you know it's there-just doesn't bother you since windows have bars and such. Source input info is shown on startup. PPI level is 90, but I don't care- The iPad Mini with retina has a 326 PPI and I find the text to look the same from different distances - except on a non-retina iPad... that does look pixely.Pluses - It's 24 Inches.Best designed display in the 130-220 range. Not better designed than the TB display but it does perform better and that's why I consider it the best in the world, even if the NEC and 10-bit displays are out there... This one is still the best designed.Low energy usage.Starup time is fast.6 MS respond times- the most any sane user that isn't into competitive FPS gaming or Dota 2 will ever need.Deep blacks - One of the best implementations I have ever used... that isn't OLED based.No tint change on angles or grey fog vertically.It's 1920x1080 resolution makes it future proof for another 6 years until 4K  is mainstream... though you'll find the image doesn't change much if you already had HD. It just look clearer- same thing I said with the iPad Mini retina... if you own an iPad rMini you don't need 4K at all."],["I purchased this monitor from our local Best Buy for this same price.  The monitor fits my need perfectly, as I am an amateur photographer and spend considerable time editing photos.  The setup for this monitor was very simple and took less than ten minutes to install.  The resolution and colors are great, and in my opinion the value for the price is outstanding.  I would certainly recommend this monitor to others."],["The display on the monitor is beautiful, I love it.  The problem is that this is not the square monitor, it is rectangular like an HDTV, and the stand for it is not wide enough so the monitor wiggles slighty when you do anything, like type on the keyboard or move the mouse.  I need to figure out some way to support the sides and stop the wiggle, it is pretty disconcerting."],["I'm very disappointed with this monitor. I bought it for my office, and the text quality is very, very poor. I can see the spaces between the pixels clearly. Perhaps a 24' monitor should have more pixels than 1080. Can't comment on gaming/video performance. Looks very neat, though."],["I purchased this display for use with a 15&#34; Retina Macbook Pro instead of opting for the Thunderbolt Display. Given the price, this is a much better deal.When purchasing, I was concerned about the 1920x1080 resolution at this size, especially next to the super high resolution Macbook's screen, but it turned out to be just fine. You can absolutely tell the difference a retina display makes, but the lower resolution of this display becomes a non-issue after awhile. In addition, the color and contrast are great.While some reviewers take issue with the glossy display, I find it to really improve the aesthetics of the product and match the glass displays of Apple products. Glare is a factor, but not a deal breaker if you can control the light in your room.One of the best features of this display is the audio out port on the back that taps into HDMI's audio capabilities. This was a surprise, and is a nice way to attach external speakers without having to plug in another cable.The price of this display is probably one of its best features. For less than $200, this is a quality product that is probably the best looking display aesthetically that Dell makes.If you are a Mac owner uninterested in Apple's own $1000 thunderbolt display that hasn't been updated since 2011, this is an EXCELLENT alternative. In fact, you could get a couple of these and a thunderbolt dock for less than one TB display."],["Things I liked:-Excellent price-Beautiful color after dropping the green a bit. I've heard viewing angles aren't as good as IPS, but it's still much better than the typical TN laptop screen I was using.-Extremely good contrast ratio - the best in Dell's S-series as this uses AMVA instead of IPS like the others.-I was worried about ghosting because of the overdrive, but the only thing I've been able to find is the rare dark cursor-trail when moving over some grey backgrounds. I probably wouldn't have noticed this for a while if I hadn't specifically been looking.-Very, very glossy and reflective compared to your typical monitor. I love it; others may prefer matte screens. You probably won't want to use this next to a window, or where you don't have control over the room lighting.-Glass seems durable and easy to cleanA few cons and notes:-No DVI input - just VGA and HDMI-Only up/down tilt is adjustable. Turning it to face more left or right means picking the base up and turning it, which can be a bit of a hassle for a monitor of this size and weight.-If you're using an AMD GPU, you'll want to switch your pixel format to \"RGB 4:4:4 Pixel Format PC Standard (Full RGB)\" to get the best contrast ratio (slightly better than default). If you're using an Nvidia GPU through HDMI, contrast ratios will reportedly be horrible unless you set the digital color format to \"YCbCr444\". (Credit to PC Monitor's review for this information).Updates:-In the comments, Mike D has pointed out an alternative to using YCbCr444."],["This monitor has me smiling everytime I use my desktop.  It is phenomenal.  Will be buying a 2nd for great multi-display computing in the very near future."],["This is a good example of why VA panel's were created.It has better color reproduction than LCDs without the light black levels in IPS panels, better than my other monitors. The glossy screen would definitely be a distraction if facing a light source. When viewing from an angle colors remain the same hue, but the image is unacceptable to me beyond 45 degrees due to distortion as the screen grays out with white's darkening and blacks lightening. Personally, that's fine with me since I use it at a work station in my office and don't want my personal work to be presented to anyone who might be in the room.I'd buy another if I need more monitors in the future.--------Update:Looking to purchase another monitor and am leaning to this one again. This is the only monitor in Dell's 'S' (Studio) line that isn't an IPS panel, but there aren't really and drawbacks.Since I wrote the review I've grown quite fond of this. I've found a comprehensive review where the reviewers have created a nice color profile to perfect the display. The colors are a bit cool out of the box. [...]Enjoy!"],["This monitor delivers brillant colors.  Pictures look fantastic on it.  Best used away from windows.  This monitor shows glares, so keep that in mind when buying and when setting up your computer.  This monitor delivers great pictures and scenes."],["I like the monitor, but my computer is in a very well lit room with windows on two sides.  Unless it is night or an overcast day, the windows created so much glare on the monitor, I had to get a room divider folding screen to block the light.  If windows could be a problem, you may want to get a monitor with a matte screen."],["A month ago, I bought a new Dell computer with the S2440L monitor. After 8 years of using a 19 inch monitor, this opened a whole new world (sort of) especially since I specialize in nature photography. In fact, the only problem I had was that I found I was throwing out 5 year old photos that looked pretty good with XP and the standard 19\" monitor. I also do a lot of work with spreadsheets monitoring bird nesting (mentioned for a reason - see below), and it was great having 12 months spread across the width of the entire monitor.I didn't have to touch any menus or adjust anything when I powered it up with the new computer (Windows 7 if that matters). In days of yore, I remember getting a new monitor and having to diddle with brightness and contrast for two or three days before I was satisfied. But this was sharp and bright, but not too sharp or too bright.My wife, whose just a little slower than I am to adapting to technology, liked what she saw, and so I bought a second Dell S2440L for her five moth old Windows 7 Dell computer. It arrived today, and I \"assembled it\" (if you call tightening one screw on the base, \"assembling\") and had it hooked up to her computer in less than 15 minutes. Turned on the computer and, of course, it had rearranged all the icons. (Why do they do that???) Anyway, she's happy as a lark because she does financial stuff for a number of companies plus our own, and she probably uses spreadsheets more than word processing or even email. She LOVES what it's done for Quicken as well, and now she's just sorry she didn't have this 5 months ago.Now, fair warning, I bought these from Dell whose price was $250 plus tax, but as a 30 year customer, they didn't charge shipping which is the norm. Out of curiosity, I came to Amazon to see what they carried the computer and monitor and see what they got. Well, Amazon doesn't list our computers which as \"commercial\" types, but there was the monitor at $50 less than what Dell charged. I called Dell, and they immediately gave me a $100 credit on my credit card. There was no difficulty whatsoever (which is why we've been buying from Dell for 30 years). I'm sure if things were reversed, Amazon would have done the same. It's why I rank them both as my two favorite companies. If I could find one more, I'd never have to leave the house. Btw, Best Buy also listed the monitor for $200 last weekend, but Dell didn't ask anything more than Amazon's price.For those who listed the base as being unstable or not substantial, pshaw (can't find the right adjective). The base is very sturdy and the monitor is well balanced. The monitor, btw, can be tilted but not raised or lowered. That is not a problem for us, but it may be a concern for others. Just raise or lower your chair. For those who said, \"cheap plastic.\" Well, I never heard of \"expensive plastic,\" and I doubt if you could find something encased in metal that would look or perform any better. Besides, you want a monitor that is stable enough, but doesn't weigh a ton. And the price is reasonable, very reasonable. Take a look at a comparable Apple!!!!"],["Good monitor, perfect size. Just did not make me so happy on the resolution side once I'm not able to configure it with smaller size view in order to optimize the size of the screen."],["Always a little lery about used purchases, but the item was just like new and worth every penny.

I recommend this monitor to anyone looking for comfort and quality entertainment."],["This monitor is a fantastic piece of machinery. For the price, it is all you can ask for. Great resolution, stunning quality and a rich deep picture. This monitor comes with a driver which allows you to select different window layouts. These different layouts allow you to drag and drop windows into different \"tiles\" laid out in any of the 15 or so layouts given by Dell. These layouts work like the Windows7 share screen.I have seen a few comments about \"IPS\". While it is true that this monitor does not have IPS, it is still an amazing picture. IPS is something used primarily for photo-editing as it gives a much \"truer\" color display. However for someone who uses their computer for gaming, working, and watching Netflix/Hulu or Youtube, not having an IPS monitor is just fine (and even preferred by many general users like me).Personally I do a lot of higher quality gaming (such as World of Warcraft) and this monitor delivers everything I could ask for. Fast refresh rate, high quality, and rich color scheme. Again its not an IPS, but for non-editing purposes I prefer non IPS monitors. Great monitor for the common and advanced users alike. Take advantage of the sale while it is still around!"],["I really like this monitor. I was able to get it refurbished cheaply, and it's been extremely worthwhile. I love the glossy screen.

The 1920x1080 resolution is perfect for a 24-Inch -- I'm barely able to make out the pixels on the screen. (The 1920x1080 resolution may be a little too low for the 27\" version of this monitor, however.)The display is BRIGHT and the quality of the display for both Image and text is superb. The colors are vibrant (thanks to the glossy -- as opposed to matte -- screen) and true-to-life (thanks to its 32-bit color depth). To utilize the full HD resolution, the monitor is best used with full HD streaming and Blu-ray.Text is sharp! in both landscape and portrait monitor orientation (NVIDIA allows the display to be oriented in portrait or landscape, and I have the monitor mounted on a rotatable monitor arm). On my old monitor, the text would be jaggedy in portrait mode. The portrait mode is perfect for reading those long arduous documents and for photo editing in Photoshop (or other image editing software) where the photo is in portrait orientation.The refresh rate at 5ms is fast enough, so there is no ghosting. Note that the quality of the display also depends in large part on your display adapter. Pair this monitor with at least a descent graphics card (and most integrated graphics cards do not qualify as \"descent'). I'm using a low-endGeForce 8400GS, which is quite acceptable for a one-monitor setup, but barely adequate for a dual monitor setup.This is my first LED backlit monitor, and I was pleasantly surprised to find it emits almost NO HEAT! -- which means it's energy efficient (most of the energy is used for display and very little is dissipated as heat). The monitor will save you a lot of money in energy bills down the line.Now, I do have a couple of complaints:(1) Wobbly Stand, No Height AdjustmentThe stand is wobbly and its height cannot be adjusted.(2) Not VESA CompatibleThe monitor is not VESA compatible, which means you won't be able to mount this monitor on a monitor arm -- not without a third party adapter anyway. I use VESA adapters for two of these monitors on my Ergotron dual arms (I actually bought TWO of these S2440L monitors for a dual monitor setup). To find an S2440L VESA adapter, simply search for \"S2440L VESA adapter\" on the Web.---Despite a couple of shortcomings, I love this monitor.

I'm a gamer with a high end computer so clarity, efficiency and all that good stuff is important to me. Definitely an upgrade from my old 19 inch. Set up was easy, but I didn't like the Dell Monitor installer. The right side control panel is pretty easy to navigate through, and the touch capabilities respond well. HOWEVER! The biggest downside to this monitor from what I've found is it flickers and blacks out. Thing is, Dell support goes through this process that requires a \"support\" tag that their products are supposed to come with, but this monitor doesn't. So not only do I not have a way of contacting them directly through e-mail or phone, I cannot figure out how to get rid of the problem completely. I've posted a thread on their support forums and it seems like another person has had the problem, and another person with a similar problem on a different Dell monitor. Can't seem to find anything else online about it other than that. So in conclusion:Pros:-Great gloss finish: Beautiful-Easy to set up-Affordable and good quality (except the problem mentioned)-User friendlyCons:-Blacks out/flickers-Dell support is terrible. Actually probably one of the most inefficient customer support teams I've seen, and I'm not the only one who has mentioned this.According to the things the person on the support forum said and things I've experimented with, we noticed certain trends in the flickering/black outs.Possible solutions:-Roll back the drive/update driver (rolled back worked for a while, then flickered more so updated to most recent version)-Don't install/uninstall the Dell monitor management program that comes with it-Change settings on your video card software (ex. Nvidia control panel) and turn off \"inverse telecine.\"-Change the monitor settings to \"HDMI only\" (if you're using HDMI) and vice versa for VGA-Update your video card driversNotes to consider:-I'm using HDMI and don't have a VGA cable so that's what I've been using. These problems might not occur with the VGA cables.-Haven't seen anything else online about this so maybe it's not common, or just hasn't been out long enough for this to have been reported-At the time it was $179 so it was a steal for meAnyways I hope this review helped those of you who like to do their research before purchasing! In the end I still love this monitor, but hate Dell customer support's system.*UPDATE*For a while the blackouts started to occur more frequently. However, recently they've completely ceased.

You will save some money and be able to sit a normal distance without noticing the pixelation.Expanded: I have a 13\" Macbook Pro (regular, not retina) and have this connected to it as the primary display. Sitting next to each other, esthetically, they look great. Thin with clean, simple lines. Both are glossy displays, but it is quite obvious that this monitor reflects more light. In addition, the crispness of text is also very noticeable side by side. The Macbook pro has ppi (pixels per inch) of about 115, while this monitor is around 90. It might not sound like a big difference, but it is noticeable and a slight strain to the eye. To put it into perspective, the 9.7\" ipad has more (quite a bit more) pixels than this 24\" monitor. My desk at work is wide, so I sit farther away from the monitor than most (24\"+) and it doesn't really bother me. As mentioned above, for most people, the 23\" or 21.5\" in this series is probably more suitable, both have 1920x1080 so you can sit closer without noticing the pixels, and the design is only subtly different.I connected the monitor to my mac, set the contrast to 100, brightness to 70, and went through the screen calibration on the mac. After that very quick set up, it looks nearly exactly the same as the mac, colors are spot on, it is bright and beautiful. I do see some grayscale banding, it might be possible to reduce this with further settings, but I don't want to sacrifice the text crispness and don't quite have the time to try all settings permutations right now.Bottom line, for the price, this is a good monitor. I would suggest to Dell to stick with this design but tweak the specs. I would've gone for the 27\" version (S2740L) if they gave it what is now considered a standard number of pixels for that size (2560x1440) but instead they left it at 1920x1080. sad.

You can find slightly cheaper ones, but quality of build and crispness seem better than my Samsung."],["Bought this S2440L to replace my older Dell TN panel.  The display technology used in this panel is called VA or Vertical Alignment.  It is not an IPS panel.  It is supposed to have better contrast when compared to IPS and faster response times which make it more suitable for me as a programmer, and for gamming.  My cost was $199.99 but I have seen them for as little as $189.99.  Wasn't intending to purchase this one, but saw it in a store on display and was captivated by the look of the edge to edge glass.  The first thing I thought when I saw it was how pretty it was.  I find the esthetics of it visually stunning, almost Apple like.  Its beautiful!  Modern, thin and lightweight with touch sensitive menu buttons right on the glass.  This being my first monitor without an antiglare coating, I was amazed at how sharp the images look without it.  Since I would be using this in my home office, where I can control the lighting, I didn't think the highly reflective glass would be a problem and I was right.  Glad I tried it.  I don't think I'll be going  back to the anti-glare coated monitors, at least not for my home office anyway.The edge to edge glass makes it easy to keep clean as the glass is hard and does not flex like the plastic AG coated panel surfaces do.I can't find any pixel defects in the one I have either.The power supply for this monitor is external, like a laptop.  This is actually good because the monitor stays very cool and it appears to be sealed except for the place with the stand slides into it.Power consumption is quite low as well when compared to other Dell monitors this size.  It is spec'd at 18W typ.  The CF lamp on my desk uses more power.Color was a bit off out of the box, but with a little adjustment, colors are vibrant and consistent.  Not as good as IPS, but good enough.The viewing angles are spec'd the same as IPS, +/-178 degrees.  I can't tell any difference in viewing angle between this VA panel and the IPS screen on my laptop.The features this monitor is missing that I would rather have is a built-in VESA mount and a DisplayPort input.  The stand that it comes with has no height adjustment and so is useless to me.  Since I use my computer primarily for writing Verilog code (similar to C-programming) for ASIC design, I prefer the monitor to be a bit higher off the desk.  I prefer the upper 1/3 of the display to be right at eye level.  A VESA mount allows you to mount the monitor anywhere and anyway you like.  Even though it has no built-in VESA mounting pad, I was able to mount it using VESA by getting an adapter I found online for about $25.The inclusion of a displayport input would be nice, but since HDMI is able to support 1920x1080, it really doesn't matter.  I would prefer to drive it directly from my workstation's displayport output instead of having to use an HDMI adapter.  Dell should lose the VGA port and replace it with a DisplayPort.  Who uses VGA anymore anyway?There is no USB hub or speakers built into the monitor.  Some may prefer that but those features are not that important to me as there are plenty of USB ports on the computer and I already have a set of speakers.Dell also makes a 27-inch version of this monitor.  Unfortunately it has the same resolution of 1920x1080.  I find this resolution a bit low for the larger monitor.  You can start to see pixelation in small text because the pixels are bigger.  Hopefully, Dell will enhance their 27-inch edge to edge glass S-series monitor with 2560x1440 resolution.  If they do this, I will upgrade as it has the built-in VESA mount and an IPS panel and I can get 77% more stuff on the screen.  Hopefully they'll throw in a DisplayPort while there at it.All things considered, the S2440L, for $189.99 or thereabouts, you will not be disappointed."],["Beautiful display, looks absolutely stunning.

There is a power button and four menu buttons on the right side and they're all touch sensitive (no buttons). I set the display to custom because it looked the best to me, but there are several others like game, movie, warm, cool etc... I would recommend HDMI instead of VGA to connect because it really looks better that way. If you don't have one check on Amazon they have great ones for great prices!

It gives you a good feeling :)"],["Pros:Glossy ScreenSharp ColorsVery little light bleedCons:Only VGA and HDMI input, no DVINo speakersNo VESA mountI purchased this monitor to use as a dual display in conjunction with an older 22&#34; LED Viewsonic monitor.  The monitor screen is very glossy and reflects easily.  You may run into issues with too much glare from ambient room lighting so that is an issue you may need to be cautious of where you place the monitor.  The display is not IPS, but it is Dell's version of IPS, AMVA, and the quality is very good.  There is very little light bleeding in the corners of the display which is usually a concern with LED panels of all variations (the TN Viewsonic next to this Dell unit has an unbelievable amount of bleed.)  A major disappointment with the unit is a lack of a standard VESA mount.  You can find a VESA adapter online for about $30."],["First off, I will say that the colors and black depth is EXCELLENT. Compared to other IPS monitors, and especially TN panels, the colors are just as good as the IPS and the black depth destroys both (after calibration of course). The glass screen also makes it feel like a very luxurious item, although there is a slight stand wobble that happens with sudden movement, but it is unaffected by general mouse and keyboard usage. Panel uniformity is great too, and the response rate is good enough for competitive games like Counter Strike, although picky players might want to stick to their 120 hz monitors.Some minor flaws though: Black crush on the lowest 2-3 values, although this can be fixed by having the monitor tilted slightly downwards (which doesn't effect much else because the viewing angles are great). Very faint led glow on the edges, which are more noticeable on a black background. As an artist though, it still hasn't effected anything and doesn't bother me, at the least, the glow is very uniform and narrow unlike some other light bleeding issues on other monitors. Not a huge fan of the lack of vesa mounting either, would be great to have these floating off the desk but there is no support for it."],["Excellent monitor. Easy to install and very bright with great detail. 2nd of these I've bought. Suggest you buy this."],["I ordered this monitor to use with a monitor arm mounting system. This monitor doesn't provide any alternate mounting hole pattern for the application I wanted. As soon as I opened the box and looked at the back, I realized it wouldn't work, so boxed it back up and returned it. Amazon was great about quickly providing credit. I ordered a different monitor which works great with my monitor arm."],["As I'm writing this review, my words have never been so clear.  This monitor is the perfect blend of style and function.  I'm glad I upgraded to the 24&#34; screen.  I even got rid of my other TV -- if the big one is being used, I simply watch TV on my computer.If you're room is overly bright all the time, you may have trouble with the glare, but that's not a problem for me."],["I was just about to purchase a Viewsonic online but decided I wanted to see monitors in person before purchase. Went to Best Buy and saw this one and they price matched it for $179 so I did not need to order on Amazon and pay shipping charges. This monitor is gorgeous and I find excuses to watch movies on it...other than just work stuff...ie. spreadsheets...etc.  Very pleased!"],["I have this monitor hooked to a PS3 (and soon a PS4) for playing online games, particularly first-person shooters. I'm impressed with the image quality - no motion blur and great contrast.The screen is quite reflective, so make sure you place it where it will not be backlit by a window or other bright light source. While this can be a problem, the picture this type of screen provides is beautiful. However, an anti-reflective coating that many new laptops have would have helped reduce reflectiveness. The touch buttons on the side are very nice, and along with the overall design of monitor gives it a very Apple-like quality to the appearance. The menus are also easy to navigate and use to adjust settings.The recess in the back for connections is a little tight. I had to bend the HDMI cable quite sharply to be able to plug it in. Pick up an HDMI port saver if you can get a cheap one, otherwise just be a little careful.Unfortunately the first monitor I got developed a few dead pixels within a couple of days. I did not purchase it from Amazon, but I was able to easily exchange it for another monitor that has worked well with no dead pixels for the last few months.Note that contrary to some sources, this is NOT an IPS monitor. However, for my purposes this is probably preferred, since the input lag time on many IPS monitors is well suited to gaming.I would give this monitor 4.5 stars if I could, but because I can't, I'll give it 5 stars. At this price point, I feel the complaints I have are minor and do not warrant a 4 star review. If you want a great monitor for gaming or your computer and the reflectiveness won't be a problem for you, I highly recommend this monitor."],["Wow, displays have come a long way since my last monitor from 4 years ago. The field of view is so much wider than my old display. The contrast and black levels are much better than I expected. The way it reproduces color images is stunning. I would have preferred a slimmer bezel, as I am using 3 of these in a multi-monitor setup, but the bezels are by no means thick.

I got this monitor used off another site for $150, it was a steal, this monitor for $200 or less is a steal. Also, the 1920x1080 resolution is perfect for a monitor this size. The 27 inch may be too big for that resolution but it depends on the end user. Personally I went from a Dell SP2309W which is an amazing 23 2048x1152 res LCD TN monitor to an HP 2511x LED TN monitor to this a true 8 bit VA panel monitor and this monitor is better than the aforemention in every way. My ONLY complaints would be wish it had a DVI and wish it had speakers, no biggie really. Also, the glossy panel is not THAT glossy, no more than my HP2511x which is glossy. Only difference is that the Dell looks better and colors look better. Also, the reflections are clearer...big whoop. I have used this monitor with my Xbox 360, PS3 and gaming PC, its great for games, no noticeable lag, no real issues so far at all. I REALLY wish I could get this panel in a 27 inch version, totally unncessary, but hey, I upgrade my monitor and TV ever 2 years or less...I'm that guy."],["this is the best led i have ever purchased it's a must when its on sale dont go for the hype of the similar 'green' LED monitors"],["UPDATE-There is a stuck pixel on the middle of the screen.

The panel is an AMVA which means it tries to get the qualities of both TN and IPS panels.  It tries to get the awesome colors of an IPS, but the response time of a TN panel.  It sorta achieves both of those aspects.  I 've had this monitor for awhile now and I haven't run into any problems.  Its definately one of the better 24 inch monitors out there on the market.

Very easy to put on and take off, just make sure your screen cover is perfectly on the device, if not you screen cover WILL PEEL OFF. All in all a very nice case and I will not buy any other case for my ipod."],["I was looking for a case for my new G4 I-pod Touch that would offer some protection if dropped, protect from scratches, and not add a lot of bulk.  This case does all that.  It is a rubberized cover that encases the back and sides of the i-pod by overlapping slightly over the top.  It is not going to protect from severe mishaps, but does reduce my anxiety about allowing my children to use the i-pod while over a hard surface.  It was a little challenging to put on without causing the screen protector to lift, but I was able to get it on and only have one small section of the screen protector pushed back.  A quick tuck with a plastic manicure tool fixed that and now all sides of the screen protector are secure under the edges of the case, it looks great, and I just don't see how they would come up.  Another complaint I read about the case in other reviews was that the cut-out for the charger cord was not large enough.  The one I have has an ample cut-out at the bottom for the charger.  In fact it is one large cut-out that exposes not only the charger connection slot, but also the speaker and the ear-bud connection spot.  So, I don't know if the manufacturer fixed this problem or if the other reviewers were using the product on a different generation of the i-pod, but this is not an issue for me.  It also has a cut out for the camera in the back.  There is not a cut-out for the spots where the power button and the volume buttons are, but rather a fitted flexible cover that goes over the buttons.  It took a bit of getting used to, pushing the buttons through the plastic, but the set-up seems to work fine.  There is no place to hook a cell phone charm to the case (as mentioned in other reviews).  I have had the case for about a month now.  I have had no problems with it coming loose or gathering lint.  I generally keep it in a pocket in my purse or it is sitting on a table somewhere.  I typically do not carry it in my pocket.  I like that the case is transparent so you can see the engraving and the apple logo on the back of the I-pod.  After reading previous reviews, I was a bit skeptical about purchasing the case, but the biggest problem seemed to be the size of the slot for the charger cable and I figured that could be fixed with some scissors.  The price of the case was less than $3 with shipping, so I went ahead and ordered it.  I am glad I did, as it was just what I was looking for."],["This case is nice and sturdy, and its inexpensive.  The quality is not like those silicone cases that are soft and flexible.  This case feels like super sturdy plastic which is good because it doesnt let your  ipod get scratched that easily.  I personally like it better than the silicone ones because those collect lint like crazy, especially if you put them in your pockets.  this case doesnt collect any lint, instead it slides into you pocket pretty easily. I gave it four stars because the bottom port, where you connect the charger, is not aligned, therefore i had to cut a little piece of so the cable could connect to the ipod. No big deal though, its still a good case"],["This is a REALLY nice case for the price it fits my ipod touch 4g like a glove, my only complaint is that the glove-like fit makes it so hard to put a screen protector on my ipod! I actually have to trim the screen protectors so this doesn't push them off or make them bubble up. The screen is the most important thing to protect which is why I had to give this only three stars because even though it's a great product and does what it should, it shouldn't prevent you from protecting the touch screen!Also you have to shimmy the bottom up if you want to plug it into an FM transmitter, but the regular charger fits perfectly with the case on."],["Its a well made case, i love the design...the cutouts could be better. But overall it is a nice nice item. A+"],["Pros:When I received this case I was delighted to see that it fit on snugly so it wouldn't start slipping off in my pocket like my silicon case did for my last iPod. I was also happy to find that it had just the right balance between grip and \"slipiness\", so it wouldn't slip out of my hand but it wouldn't get stuck in my pocket either (this happened all the time with my silicon one). Of course there is a hole for the camera and mic, and the checker pattern is just subtle enough so that it doesn't stand out to much. It is also raised slightly in the front so you can place your iPod with the screen down on the table without worrying about scratching the screen, for example if you want to keep the audio for a video playing but don't want to broadcast to the whole world what you're listening to.Cons:If you are holding the iPod in your left hand, it is literally impossible to change the volume with the volume buttons. Of course, this was an issue even without the case, but it is just exacerbated by the way that the little \"nubs\" on the case above the volume buttons are barely raised and are very slippery. Basically, you can only change the volume with the buttons if the iPod is in your right hand, and even then it's a little difficult. I finally decided just to buy a set of apple remote/mic earphones.If I bought this case at the full price of $19.99, I wouldn't recommend it, but since it's on sale for $5 it's a safe buy, if not just  until you save up for a more expensive case and if you can deal with the volume buttons."],["This case fits very securely around the Ipod Touch 4th generation. It does what it says. The only drawback are the volume controls are a little hard to use now. The price is right, and performs better than most cases in the $20 -$25 range!"],["The case fits well and is sturdy. it's a soft gel case, but it's pretty sturdy so that when you put it on, it feels solid. plus, the surface is smooth so that dust and lint don't stick to it, unlike the rubbery kinds, which is nice. the color's darker than i expected, but still looks nice and slick. I love the checkered pattern on the backside.It saved my ipod from a recent fall onto my garage floor.My only complaint is that it covers the volume and power buttons. the case is raised where it covers the buttons, to mimic the feel of them, but it is a bit hard to press. i have to use my fingernails."],["The product come as described.  It's pretty nice.  I press the button no problem.  It come with a tiny spot of stain, but it's ok to me."],["Great looking case and feel for the ipod touch 4th generation.  It doesnt add any excess bulk either.  The only problem I have with this case so far is that the power button on the top right is hard to press down.  The volume buttons are also a little tougher to press.Overall, for $9 you cant go wrong to protect the ipod touch.  I wouldnt recommend this case for someone who is afraid of dropping it on a hard surface. More for someone who wants to protect the mirror on the back and sides."],["for this price, I do think it is a good deal to buy it.although some parts of the cover are not smooth, I used the knife to reshape it and now it is perfect."],["Nice and sturdy. Very snug fitting for the fourth edition iPod touch. You cant go wrong with this product for this price."],["I think this is an excellent product. Fits on my iPod Touch 4G easily and nice and snug. All of the buttons are accessible including the camera on the back. The only buttons that are covered are the volume (up/down), but I have no problem changing the volume through the gel skin - I don't have to use my fingernails. Looks attractive with the argyle pattern and the feel is very nice. Easily slides in and out of your pocket and the material has a nice feel - better than the hard metal of the Touch. I like the smoke color (brownish) and the amazingly low price.I also bought the DLO HipCase Leather Folio Case for iPod touch 2G, 3G (Black), so I could carry my Touch on my hip. With this TPU gel skin, my Touch 4G still fits into the DLO case - though rather snuggly. Since the 4G is slightly slimmer than the older models, I thought this older case would work perfectly and it does.Update: I have had this cover on my Ipod Touch for almost 2 years now and it still is in perfect shape. I plan to buy another just for a change of color. Highly recommend."],["Well i bought two of them cuz i couldnt find another ones that filled my expectations, but this ones are veery good(not perfect, but close!) it lets the ipod a bit unprotected for the same reason it will look great, a very slim and thin material that will not leave any residue in your ipod's metal back(thats why i hate silicone ones!)Its not expensive at all, and it fits perfectly so why not?"],["Great add on to my ipod touch - it has a nice 'grippy' feel to keep it from sliding off counters & keep in my hand.

Also easier to grip it when playing video games :-)"],["I just bought this cover for my ipod touch 4g and I love it. I first picked it out because of its attractiveness. I couldn't decide between this color (smoke) or the clear. I'm sure it doesn't make too much of a difference but the smoke blends in nicely with the back of the ipod. The cheap price also helped! Most covers that I have researched with this quality are a lot more expensive. The cover seems durable, compared to the flimsy and tearable ipod covers that my friends have possessed. This cover does not give me any issues when I touch the volume buttons or the power button but maybe I just have small fingers. I do not have a screen protector but I can't imagine any cover would work great with one since they would both overlap. Also, speedy shipping! I would willingly buy from this seller anyday."],["I read one of the reviews and I thought mind as well give it a try.Not that great.The cases doesnt really hold my touch good enough, pushes off my screen protector. not using it."],["This case was great for my ipod, considering I drop my ipod often. And even after I got this case I still drop it to this day, but the good news is, is that this case has protected my ipod through all the drops. The only problem with this product is that on/off switch and volume rocker is covered but there is a raised bump in the plastic that goes over the on/off switch and volume rocker but it still makes turning the ipod on and off and raising and lowering the ipod difficult. But other than that, all the ports at the bottom of the ipod are open and are easy to access. So even with the minor problems of the covered buttons which I got used to having to push a little harder. I would still recommend this product"],["The product is great there is only one con to this.

It's a nice, slighly brown, translucent cover for the back of the ipod that fits very, very snuggly.  Volume and power buttons are off by about 3mm, but there's enough overlap to hit the buttons effectively.  The lack of perfect overlap is only noticeable when pushing the buttons and upon very close examination. The overlap for the camera, dock, and earphone jack is preserved perfectly.My recommendation is to stretch the cover for about a minute or two, twisting and bending it so that when you apply it to your ipod, it won't be so stiff.It's a great bargain price cover that does the job and comes with no other surprises aside from the shifted fit for the volume and sleep/power buttons."],["I have the blue and clear cases like this one and they fit just right.

You are told to recharge NiCad battery power tools when they just start to show power loss.

Thats a lot of C cells. I also let go of the STEREO feature. In my fringe area, a strong stereo signal is rare and you have to endure the annoying scratchy effects as the radio shifts in and out. And the DeWalt had no way to select monaural FM. This has clean, clean, clean FM, and when the speakers are spaced 9\" apart is stereo a big plus anyway?

Beyond that, it's a great radio that will make many travels with us over the next few years.  I highly recommend this radio if you travel for work or recreation, want a radio that can take its spills in stride, and don't mind carrying the extra weight.  Sangean hits another home run with this one!Update July 2013:This little radio has traveled with me throughout the state, and seems to pick up signal well in all places!  Obviously certain low/blocked spots have caused problems, but it's mostly used to play ETV radio wherever I go...and play it does!  One thing I did find interesting (and seemed to miss before purchasing) is that one some documentation (and some reviews) it is said that this radio has 6 EQ settings, and since Sangean's manual doesn't tell me how this mythical function is accessed (and neither does a comprehensive Google search), I'm left wondering if the 6 EQ settings were touted before release, but left out at final production.  It's still not something worth subtracting a star over.  I DID purchase the Toughbox version of this so I could play MP3's around the house, and it has also served me well!  I now own three Sangean radios, including the PR-D5.  They are all excellent radios, and I would highly recommend this brand to anyone.A note to those who say it's too bass-filled/distorts at high volumes: I will freely admit that I don't blare this thing like my dad does his old record player in his shop.  In my humble opinion, this isn't made to resonate greatly through 4,000 sq ft spaces at high volumes.  It's meant to be able to go with you into whatever room/situation you may be working in, and continue to work well due to its rugged durability.  Currently this radio is in service behind my desk at work, where it's kept at low-to-moderate volume, and continues to serve me well.A note to those who have interference issues in specific rooms, but not in others: This radio, like most others, is not immune to electromagnetic interference.  This can come from some rather strange places, but remember that anywhere there is wiring close by (or other appliances putting out radio waves or micro waves), there is a possibility for interference.  An interesting example for you...this radio used to sit on the floor beside my desk, right next to a Cat5e cable that connects my PC to the local network.  Whenever a page took any extra amount of time to load (say, for instance, on Amazon), the radio would buzz a little due to EM noise originating from the network cable.  Wherever you decide to place this radio, it's best to keep in mind that other electrical appliances/connections/cabling could potentially generate some static for you."],["No complaints - worked great on the jobsite for which it was intended.Not particularly attractive but very sturdy, good reception in general."],["I purchased this radio for my barn about a month ago.

Results as follows:  First off if you are use to listening to inexpensive table radios or portables with a small tinny screaming speaker you might find the Lunchbox annoying at first because it sounds deep and full and clear maybe a bit on the bass side.  But instead of sounding earsplitting when you crank it up it sounds better yet.  I went across the bands AM and FM on my old radio and the Lunchbox side by side. Overall the Lunchbox far outperformed my old standby.  It did not necessarily pull in more stations but in comparison it was way more clear and exact with no fuzzy background noise.  The night time AM reception was crystal clear and did not drift in and out one bit. That alone to me was worth the price of the radio.  FM reception the same.

When i was checking it on line there was the sangean lb-l00 along with its brother the tb-100.

It is not listed on the box or in the manual. I downloaded the sales flyer from the Sangean site (on support section) and it clearly states there is a 6 setting EQ also, so this is not Amazons fault, it is the manufacturers.

I will call Amazon and tell them about the false information from Sangean. They have always been great at taking care of any problems I had with purchases. 5 stars to Amazon.I should add that I spent 20 years in the retail electronics field and this is the first time I have seen a manufacturer make such a mistake on a product description.

As someone who installs high-end audio/video systems in homes, this radio probably seems like an unlikely choice for me. I was looking for a simple radio to take with me, and not have to worry about. Judging by the photos, I figured this would be made from your typical flimsy plastic that you see in most electronics, but it's actually a very thick and sturdy plastic. Paint and grease wipe of easily. It weighs a little more than I expected, but I know it will survive most accidental drops.

I often keep it beside my desk to listen to during the day as reception is better than my shelf system (though not as good as the Sangean PR-D5).It's virtually impossible to find this type of quality nowadays.  The \"good\" name brands we see on the shelves in the States don't touch Sangean.This is one of those items where I think I should purchase a back up in case something happens to mine because quality of construction (even with a particular manufacturer) rarely (never?) seems to improve.  It's always getting cheaper and flimsier.  And with the exception of the Sangean U3 (the one I got my Dad), I've never seen/heard something I find to be equal for the price.I love the volume and channel knobs.  You can easily \"twirl\" them with one finger tip to move up or down the dial extremely quickly.I have 2 Sangeans (and got a different one for my Dad).  All of them have this same ability, even with the knobs in different places.Reception is great; sound is great; durability is great.  I enjoy the sound of this one over comparably-sized stereo radios.I love the cord storage and the rock-solid battery compartment lid.This radio has a hard-to-find feature in that the receiver can be tuned to .1 all the way up and down the dial.  E.g., you can tune to 88.8, 88.9, 90.0 where most radios make you skip 88.8 and 90.0.  Fine tuning is thus better and more accurate for difficult-to-tune stations even if stations don't technically use the even numbers.My only gripe is the \"C\" batteries.  It's a bit goofy because the indoor, smaller Sangean PR-D5 (excellent) hold 6 C cells and the Lunchbox only holds 4!  The Lunchbox should at least have the 6, if not 8.  For an outdoor radio I really want batteries that are going to last a very long time.  I wish it ran on D batteries, expecially for a radio that really puts out some sound/base (for its size) and thus will draw some power.  And the batteries do last awhile (at least 25-35 hours, but I keep the volume modest because I want to conserve the batteries), just not as long as larger batteries would allow."],["Easiest radio I have ever used.

And the LB 100 gets plenty loud.Now, if you turn the tone control knob on the U3 to emphasize bass at the expense of treble, the U3 will pump out way more bass, but much too much to suit my taste.That said, I think the LB 100 slightly exmphazizes bass over treble at its standard setting. I would prefer a touch more treble, but for the money, this radio is a tremendous value. It's built tough, is a pleasure to operate, and does everything it's supposed to do.

Have been looking for a versitle and rugged radio with great reception on the beach.  With this product I have found what I was looking for."],["Extremely pleased with this radio.  Was looking for something simple/sturdy to take out on the boat, raft, dock, etc.  The construction of the radio is top notch - There's simply no way that anything (water, dirt or anything) can get inside it.  The roll cage gives the radio a distinctive look and makes carrying the radio extremely easy.  The radio is slightly heavier than I thought it would be but its ruggedness more than makes up for it.  I've put it on rocks, sand, dirt and it's been thrown around in the back of my truck and it looks exactly the same as it was when I first took it out of the box.  The yellow color is slightly darker than the pictures suggest - like a darker \"taxi\" yellow.  I was a little nervous about the color, I usually prefer black appliances, but the radio looks solid and great and I've gotten a lot of compliments on it.As for battery power, he radio seems to last forever with the batteries in.  I've left the radio on unplugged overnight several times (had the volume turned all the way down and forgot to turn it off) and it was still on in the morning with plenty of juice for the rest of the day.  Also, the radio is great in the elements.  I've left it outside a few nights and it has not affected it at all.  The radio also functions just as well in sub-freezing temperatures.I was most surprised by the sound quality as there is only one speaker.  I was not expecting the radio to be able to be played so loud and I definitely was not expecting there to be any bass at all.  As others have mentioned, the bass can be a bit overpowering at times - but I really don't mind it as I usually have the bass turned up anyway.  This usually only happens when the radio is turned about 3/4 of the way up - which is not really that necessary since turning it up to about 1/2 volume is almost always sufficient if you are anywhere near the radio.The simplicity of the radio is refreshing and is easy for anyone to use.  5 pre-set buttons, a button for switching bands, a power button, and two knobs for adjusting the volume and tuner.  After having the batteries run out and having to replace the batteries multiple times, the radio has not lost track of its presets even once.  My only complaint would be no AUX port to plug in my iPhone -  although I just use a cheap Bluetooth FM broadcaster from my iPhone if I want to play something from there."],["I wanted a &#34;Jane plain&#34; radio to take camping and this one was so highly rated....I ordered it. I wasn't sure about the looks until I received it.....how cute....looks like a baby generator:-)  So very sturdy with great sound, attractive color, and functionality. I immediately attached the antenna and plugged it in. No complaints about receiving most of my preferred channels (both AM & FM). I am very pleased, especially since I knew nothing about this brand."],["Rugged, sturdy radio; good for shop.  Stations too far away don't always come in clearly but most often really good."],["Wonderful sound. Rugged quality!! Very much worth every penny paid. Highly recommend to any one looking for a quality sound."],["I have some other Sangean radios, and I like the sound. It makes voices/words clear to understand. I don't listen to AM radio much, but I listen to K-LOVE, positive Christian station, and I want to hear the words!In my area, K-LOVE is on 88.9. When I received my fantastic Lunchbox radio yesterday, uh-oh, there was some static on 88.9. Well, my Sangean radios do a great job of receiving it, but it does require some antenna power. I put my fingers on the antenna and the static disappeared. I took them off, static came back, put them back on, static went away, etc.I don't need to move this radio around much at all. I have it plugged in and situated and I love it where it is. So, I fixed the static problem forthwith. I took a rather long piece of copper wire, wrapped it around the top of the antenna, and trailed it to a vacant corner of the room. No more static!I just adore the sound of this radio. I also adore the looks--it is my favorite color!I like the fact that it is simple. I want a radio. I want it to be digital, because tuning a non-digital radio is just not as convenient for me. I don't need to power other speakers with it (it has plenty of speaker power!), or hook up an MP3 player or whatever. I didn't even put batteries into it. I did open the battery compartment and look in. Didn't need a screwdriver to do that!!!Where you want a radio to listen to, have a bit of room to place it, and value solid, clear sound and durability, this is a great choice!UPDATE:I put this radio in a spot where I can listen to it at robust volume while grooming my Standard Poodle (that is a BIG job, and it must be done faithfully), and at soft volume while I sleep. Other times I turn it on at various volumes to keep that music flowing. It does me SUCH good. Helps the dog, too. We listen exclusively to KLove, and it really feeds my heart, mind, and spirit--and evidently the dog's, too.I have a very nice small Sangean right at the bed where I can set the volume so I can hear it but hubby can't, and we can both sleep. It has superior dynamics for understanding words, and that is VERY important to me with Christian music. No real bass, though.Well, this Lunchbox rascal has great sound with bass. I accidently discovered that I love the sound when I play both radios together. It's like a combination of stereo and increased sound range.Well, this radio still has the copper wire, still working great in that spot to keep 88.9 clear. I decided to order ANOTHER Lunchbox radio to put it in the kitchen and play at the same time as the same other model of Sangean that is in the bedroom. The new Lunchbox arrived yesterday.Well, first, it is easy-peasy to unpack, set-up, and operate--THANK YOU, SANGEAN!I don't need it to recharge stuff, hook up various devices, or the other things some Work radios do. I need exactly what this radio does, and exactly the ways it does them! I even ADORE the color! It is my favorite color.I was thrilled when I got the two radios playing together in the kitchen. Great, great, GREAT! It really feeds me in so many ways.And, must be the difference in exact locations, but though I had the copper wire and clipper all ready to wind that around the antenna and boost reception of 88.9--so far, no need at all!I am SO glad to have two of these radios, at opposite ends of the house! This is a great radio!"],["This unit is small, simple, and sounds great.  The Sangean LB-100 has exceeded all expectations and sounds great not only in my workroom but outdoors as well."],["I wanted a rugged little radio that sounded good, decent AM reception, is easy set, and AC power and C cell batteries when we lose power.

I purchased this radio a few months ago to carry with me to work and on the boat, (since it is water, and shock resistant). I did a little research on the radio before purchasing and decided to take a gamble on it. Boy howdy! What a solid radio. I set the radio on the side of my utility truck yesterday while at work to listen to music between the sound of noisy equipment running as I am a Tree Surgeon i.e. chain saws, blowers, chippers, etc.... Well I knocked off for lunch, hopped in my truck and drove away. So I'm driving down US 1 in the Florida Keys to my favorite Resturant and I'm crossing the fourth  bridge when I hear a BANG outside the vehicle, I look at the side view mirror and watch in horror as my Lunch Box Radio bounces down the emergency lane, hits the concrete barrier wall and continues flipping down the emergency lane finally coming to rest in the middle of the south bound lane in which I'm traveling. BTW I'm traveling at 50 mph when this occurs!! So my first thought is, the radio is history and I should probably just drive on and not turn around to retrieve the carcass, but I did and to my profound amazement it was still playing. Upon further inspection I was astounded to see that the only damage to the thing was to the tubular frame work around the radio, the very end of the antennae, and the tuning knob were missing!! UNBELIEVEABLE!!!!! So I call Sangean the manufacturer and they were kind enough to ship me the replacement parts at a nominal fee. The radio is in perfect condition and still sounds beautiful. Folks if you are looking for a RUGGED, SIMPLE, GREAT SOUNDING!!!! radio, look no further than the SANGEAN \"Lunch Box\" portable, and in my opinion indestructible radio.

You do not loose your presets. I have all dewalt tools, I chose this over the dewalt radio because of other amazon reviewers.

'Even before I bought the U3, I wanted the Sangean LB-100, which had been praised by many, but was unavailable in the US market until recently.So for about $75 and free shipping on Amazon, I bought the LB-100. I fretted the possibility that the LB-100's AM might not be up to par with the bigger U3.But a side by side reception comparison results in what appears to be close performance, and very impressive AM and FM. The LB-100's slightly smaller ferrite AM antenna produces a little less sensitivity but produces good overall AM sound. Just a shade less than the U3's.'One thing I don't like about both the Lunchbox and the U3 is that the non-rotation screw-in FM antenna doesn't give you any option to perform fine-tuning when wanting to get in a troublesome station (all worksite radios have such an antenna built like this to be rugged). Not that you need to adjust the antenna much. The FM sensitivity is so good that such adjusting isn't necessary. However, for weak FM stations like 89.3 and 88.9 it would be nice to have a rotating FM antenna. As strong as the FM is on both radios, I can't grab the weakest FM station I know of, 88.9, on the U3 and the LB-100 like I can with the Redsun RP-2100 (CCrane CSW) or the Grundig S350.Now for AM reception. Very sensitive. The sound is very appealing through the 5-inch speaker, just like on the bigger U3.  'Unlike the U3, which has a clock, headphone jack, and aux port, the LB-100 has none of these and is, in spite of being digital with 5 presets for AM and FM, a very bare bones radio, a sort of 1980 Ford Ranger truck, which didn't even come with a radio, ironically enough.'You might want to pay an extra $25 and get the added features of the U3 and enjoy a bigger ferrite AM antenna (though I personally didn't hear any difference in AM between the two).One thing to consider is that the footprint on the LB-100 is not small at 8x8 inches. I was going to use the LB-100 in the kitchen but its size may make me change my mind and take it to the work office or use in one of the bathrooms.I do want to commend Sangean on the battery compartment (takes 4 C batteries). This is not one of those latches that you snapped broken because you breathed too heavily on the hinges. This hinge uses a big screw and looks like it was built to last.Conclusion: At the $75 price point, the LB-100 has a rugged look, a loud yellow color, excellent fidelity, and strong AM and FM reception.

I wanted something that was just a radio (no need for an ipod hookup or bluetooth streaming while washing the car or tinkering in the garage) and I wanted something that was designed to be used in the wild as my garage can get dusty from woodworking.The Sangean Lunchbox fits the bill perfectly.When you take it out of the box you'll immediately notice that it isn't made of lightweight cheap plastic - it feels substantial and &#34;rugged&#34; for sure. I'm not going to toss it around to test it out but it looks/feels like it can take a little abuse.The controls are very basic - volume and tuning knobs, buttons for 5 preset stations, button to switch between AM/FM and a power switch.The sound - after using it for a week I think I would give it a &#34;pretty good&#34; for audio quality. It's a tad &#34;bassy&#34; or &#34;boomy&#34; at first however once you step away from the radio and go about your business you''ll find it sounds fine. That is to say - they EQ'd it for open spaces where it is competing with noises - it almost sounds better once you step away from it and get to work! It's not a tabletop radio so don't purchase it for your nightstand or you may be disappointed.The reception is fine although it's interesting that I get the same reception when I unscrew the antenna - it doesn't seem to have any effect on the reception.My one issue, which is not so much with the radio, is that the description on the detail page states it has 6 EQ settings you can use and this seems to be patently false. There's no mention in the manual of any EQ settings and nothing on the radio that can be used to access alternate EQ's - the A+ copy also states there are 6 preset buttons and this is false too. Sangean needs to correct the product detail page.Overall I really like the radio and hope to get many years use out of it in my garage."],["Nice and sturdy!

Half volume and it starts to rumble.  From 4 feet or more away, the sound is unintelligible.  I've even questioned whether this is a real Sangean radio.  There is no model number anywhere on the unit or in the instruction book.  Nowhere does it say LB-100.  (Chinese ripoff?)  Amazon needs to look into this.

All I wanted was a simple digital AM/FM radio.  No CD player, MP3 player port, or short wave capability.  Just a simple radio.  It took me all of 6 months to find this little gem. I've had one other Sangean radio before but it quit working after a year or so. So naturally I was reluctant to buy another one.  But I've taken this one through its paces.  Definitely a sturdy construction.  Visually appealing.  Large footprint.  And at the $79 price point (+ $9 shipping), I thought it was a bit steep but I bought it anyway.  The sound is a little base-y like some other reviewers have pointed out but it's tolerable. Fills a room with rich sound when listening to FM music. I'm wondering if Sangean will ever be incentivized to build a 2-speaker/stereo version of this radio so it would resemble a boombox.  You know, with all the trimmings:  MP3 USB port, bass/treble knobs, weather frequencies, etc.  They could call it the \"Cooler.\"  Until they do, I'll keep enjoying this neat little radio."],["I bought this for my son-in-law as a Christmas present.

The cord wrap is good and the cord is round and heavy duty. The tip of the cord has the piece sticking up so you can lock the cord in it at the end.

It locks on to the FM stations without drifting and unlike the Eton that I replaced it with, I do not need to constantly move it around to keep the stations in tune.

I also like the built in AC cord that doesn't require an external transformer. My only reservation is that I hope it is reliable over the long term. Too soon to tell."],["This is a perfect radio for my shop. The radio pulls in stations fine as long as it is on the window sill. The speaker does have a \"bass\" sound to it so if I had a complaint it would be there is no bass/treble adjustment.

She's constantly winning movies tickets, theme parks, meals, etc. and she needs a good quality radio to withstand the coffee spills trying to reach for the phone, the elbows that push the radio off the counter, and a long cord to reach an outlet. This radio does all of that. She doesn't care about cds, or tapes, or mp3s. The digital tuner is perfect, and even allows for some minute tuning and the presets are all she needs.

I want perfect sound.  And I want it to work perfectly, every time.  When my Sony portable shortwave started giving me problems - the tuning knob was inconsistent and the sound outdoors inadequate - I knew it was time for a new radio.The first surprise with the Lunchbox is how durable it is.  It ships in a cardboard box (big surprise) but no foam or other packaging to protect the radio.  The frame itself is all it needs to stay safe in shipping.One of the big concerns other reviewers had was the boominess of the bass.  I have experienced no such issues.  On both FM and AM, voices are clear.  The speaker is large, and it moves a lot of air, so there is no tinniness to the sound.  As a side benefit, AM hiss is inaudible on strong signals.Reception is astonishingly good.  While boom boxes around the house have pockets of poor reception on FM, this radio pulls everything it should in perfectly.  Tuning is accurate and strong.  For long-distance on AM, reception matches my Sony shortwave - which had some of the best AM reception I've ever had.  My CCrane Twin Foil Ferrite antenna does no better than this unit by itself.If I had it to do over again, I would have bought this radio much sooner.

Mostly at department stores that have the Milwaukee, DeWalt, Ryobi, and Makita radios.  I nearly spent the $100 on the midsize Milwaukee radio 2790-20 12V to 28V Jobsite Radio.  After some thought, I didn't want to spend the extra $50 on a battery and a charger.  None of these other radios will run on regular C or D batteries.  My main use for the radio will be in the backyard around the fire and camping.  I've killed many \"cheap\" radios by having them along in the elements so I figured it was time to spend a little more and get something that would last.  When I came across the Lunchbox online I bought it right away simply because it would run on regular C batteries or plug in the wall.  After receiving the item I was pleasantly surprised with the quality feel of the buttons and knobs for tuning and volume.  The sound quality is much better than I thought you could get from a 5 inch speaker and for $60.

I've used the Sangean LB-100 now for three tailgates and it works quite well for what I wanted...my team's pregame show. It can be turned up quite loud and works great for voice radio. For a single speaker, music also sounds pretty good. Clearly, with one speaker, there is no stereo effect. But all in all, the sound is quite good for its size and price point. The box and frame are very sturdy and well built. I am sure this radio could take quite a bit of abuse and keep on working. Probably would be excellent for a construction, work site or just outside while you are gardening or working in the yard. Strength of reception on the AM dial is better than my car radio. FM reception seems fine also although I have not done any extensive testing.My only complaints would be the removable antenna has no storage location on the radio. And the black handle/frame is kind of ugly and unnecessary. They could have just put a handle on the top of the radio and created a flat bottom with rubber feet.Very high quality item that is well constructed of strong plastic with a good sound system."],["I have only had it a few days, but it looks like I have found the perfect radio for listening to music while working.

Digital tuning that's a big deal and the one must feature. It picks up all the stations I listen to and ones I didn't know were there. The power is plenty loud and very surprising for it's size. The sound is very good at 25% vol to about 75% vol, lower than 25% the tone has to much base in it, but it's still OK just not great, at vol level over 70% it's much too sharp (Treble) but 70% and over is very loud and if you like playing music that loud you would probably get something with more wattage (power) than this has. At 25 % - 75 %  the sound is very rich and nice even with only the single mono speaker.

Not the easiest thing to move, I set it up on the back porch for my fence build project and after one night on the porch the morning dew killed it.I was wary at first of such a small radio but took the plunge on this Sangean LB-100 and dont regret it at all.  The reception is fantastic and the sound is even better.  It's not Bose sound by any means but during the build I'm typically 75-100 ft from the radio and have no issues with the volume.  Those reviewers saying that it has too much base must be audiophile elitists and should be buying high end gear if thats what they are looking for.  I would say this will be negligible to most listners unless you reside in the afore mentioned category.I enjoy the fact that hard to recieve stations in this area come in clear and the presets are maintained even when I move it from my garage to the back porch without any batteries.  It must have an internal memory of some sort that I was unaware of which is a bonus, although I'm not sure how long it will maintain presets without power.

I recently read a book \"Surviving The End of the World As We Know It\" and the author reminded me how important it is to have several radios of varying types in the event things go \"off grid.\"  So, when I was reviewing the types of radios that are out there, this model immediately caught my eye due to its purported ruggedness and durability.  Little did I know, however, when I purchased this that I was getting far more than a good \"survivalist\" radio.  Indeed, this is that, but it is also a certified piece of sculptural-design art, and going even further, buying this is a throw-back to the days of getting something simple, solid, utilitarian, and built to last. Manufacturing as Art.The dilemma I have is whether to buy a few more of these as collector's pieces.  If I had the space to store them, I certainly would.  I know for sure I'll be giving several of these as gifts.The main reason I felt motivated to write a review about this simple radio is for this reason:  We need more simple products like this in this overly complex world of ours. DESIGN AND QUALITY PRODUCTION LIKE THIS NEEDS TO BE RECOGNIZED AND ENCOURAGED!!!! If I was the President I would invite the engineer who designed this to lunch at the White House so he could receive the recognition he deserves. I buy so much junk which comes with owner's manuals which take a weekend or longer to read.  90% of the features on these products I don't even use most of the time. And, frequently, most of this stuff (electronics in particular) doesn't last through the year. The thing ends up in our American landfills before the consumer even becomes fully familiar with it.  Repairs?? Prohibitively expensive.With this radio you won't even need to read the owner's manual, which is nothing more than a small brochure.  You screw the antenae in, you plug in the attached ultra-heavy-gauge cord (No AC adaptor here, folks!!! Praise the Lord!! I hate those things!!!) and you're good to go. Setting the stations is totally intuitive, and if you simply want to cruise the stations you just turn the sturdy, heavy knob.  Just like the old days. Pure, utilitarian elegance.This \"Lunch Box\" radio is visually stunning and built like a brick outhouse. Solid in every way.  Nice weight to it. I was going to pack it away for that Big Emergency, but this is so dinstinctive looking that I'm going to find some place to put it where I can show it off. I think it sounds great, and it immediately tuned in all the stations I normally listen to here in southern California without any problem.Some may want to label me a \"Luddite\"--a person who is repelled by advances in technology.  There may be a kernal of truth in that assertion.  I really do get exhausted with all the upgrades, updates, innovations, advances, and obsolescences inherent in this technologically revolutionary age.  I just don't want to spend my best hours and my best years adapting to the gadgets of my era.  But I think the true attraction I have to a product like this \"Lunch Box\" radio is this concept:  Often, less is more.  This simple, robust radio with its cheerful, strong design does everything I really need.  I like knowing it will be around for a long time--probably longer than me.Many thanks to Sangean.

I was a bit skeptic buying it online and not in person where you can see the real thing about how long it is and the quality of the color, etc. but for $8.72 bucks it was a amazing price and a good find! most stores costs twice as more expensive for camera straps, I'm pretty big on saving money (considering that I am a college student) and for a really good camera strap like this and its price, I had to take advantage of it. The strap doesn't rub on my neck or bother me as my other one. The strap is a little bit long but it can be converted as a body strap for the camera.

I've got another Windows desktop in my household anyway, which I could use if I felt the need to use Windows programs. That's why I considered a Chromebook. However, it seems that most people's &#34;everyday&#34; computing isn't my everyday, and it escaped my mind because it had nothing to do with heavyweight programs.I bought this Chromebook in particular because of the screen size, the extra USB 3 port, and that it had slightly better reviews compared to the Toshiba CB35.The first thing I noticed was that it looks very nice. All white and clean and the material isn't glossy so it doesn't need to be pampered. It appears to be well constructed; I wouldn't be ashamed to have this on the same table as a MacBook, even though it isn't really as sturdy as it appears.It is one of the heavier Chromebooks, but there is a 14 inch screen here. I never cared about weight anyway.Then when I opened the display I was immediately shown the setup wizard. It seems someone had already turned it on before shipping it here. At this point a lot of people would be impressed by how quickly it awakened from sleep, but most people (still!) aren't used to having SSD's. Windows 8 with an SSD awakens just as quickly, so don't attribute it to the OS; it's the hardware.When I started typing I realized I really don't like the keyboard. I don't know how it compares to the competition but It feels worse than my old XPS M1330, and of course much worse than desktop keyboards. Travel is very short, and the keys feel undifferentiated in shape. If this is the trend of portable device keyboards, I'm so screwed. Perhaps with some major technique changes I would be able to use this keyboard proficiently.The screen really sucks, and not because of the resolution. It's been so long since I've looked at a TN display, I forgot just how bad they looked. (The HP Chromebook 11 has an IPS display, but I skipped it because of low performance and battery life.)Then I just started trying to do my everyday things, and realized how much I needed Windows after all.&#8226; I opened OneNote Online to type this review: I knew how to do this and it was very easy. Nerfed versions of other Microsoft Office programs can also be found online, such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc. Most of the office-like work and note-taking you'd do in school should be covered by these online applications, while reserving specialized programs like MATLAB to desktops (free to use at most schools).&#8226; I tried to connect to my server through SMB or something. Not possible. Some people say they're working on it but I need it now. This was a dealbreaker. Even Android can do this. And before anyone says &#34;just use cloud storage hurr hurr,&#34; my internet connection isn't fast enough to be comparable to my LAN connection and last time I checked, 10TB of Drive space was not cheap.&#8226; I tried to type Chinese. No problem; no IME's to download. The built in Pinyin IME's vocabulary was adequate. It didn't support advanced features like typing Pinyin+strokes, e.g. &#34;yan&#60;tab&#62;szs&#34; to quickly find &#24022;, but I didn't expect that.&#8226; I wanted to add fonts. Fail. According to my searches, it seems difficult, involving command line adventures, and it's not guaranteed to work.&#8226; I tried to close the lid while connected to external display without it turning off. Win! This is called &#34;docked mode.&#34; In this mode I can have the screen completely off and out of the way when I am at my desk. Of course an external keyboard is required.&#8226; I wanted to eliminate external mouse acceleration. It involves crosh, which might be intimidating for some. I said &#34;xset m 0 0&#34;. I still don't know if I did it right. The mouse movements were still too slow for me, although feeling much better from the lower acceleration.&#8226; I wanted to add an ICC profile. Not possible. They say it's in the works. And no, it's not absolutely critical for me on a Chromebook, but IMO you don't have to be a professional to appreciate a well calibrated display. I enjoy videos much more when I watch them on a decent display.&#8226; I tried playing something on the Chromebook's speakers. Speech was intelligible, which is all one should demand from them anyway. Music sounds like crap; what do you expect?&#8226; I tried playing some sound through my HD 600 headphones, from the 3.5mm jack. Yes, it was able to drive my 300 Ohm headphones to dangerous levels, although I feel like the noise floor was very high compared to a desktop motherboard. This hissing sound is Johnson-Nyquist noise. It shouldn't be audible on good amplifiers. If you want to listen to music out of this Chromebook, I recommend using an external DAC and amplifier.&#8226; I wanted to set up an equivalent to Equalizer APO. It's part of my everyday. I looked in the Chrome Web Store. Doesn't seem like there's anything.&#8226; I tried playing some of my music. I put my music on my server, which I can't access, so I turned to my Google Drive, which had some music. I tried to get the Enjoy Music Player app to find it but I guess I put it too deep or something. Playing from Chrome works though, although obviously not my preferred way of accessing music.&#8226; I wanted to access my school's email. Usually I use Outlook (the Windows program) for this. I tried using Outlook Online, which didn't let me set an Outgoing Server port, which I needed to do in order to get it working.I know a lot of my dissatisfaction is from the lack of resources for Chrome OS, and some people might feel like it's unfair to give HP hardware a lower rating because of it. When you buy a computer you also buy the OS. A major reason why many people buy Apple hardware is the software that comes with it, so I really consider Chrome OS to be part of this package here. And really, is my rating that bad? I did take into account the price, in case you're wondering.In summary, it's a well done Chromebook, but it's still a Chromebook and not a Windows machine. It's not anything bad about Chrome OS; it's just that there are so many more resources for Windows, and if you're used to them like me, you'll start taking them for granted. It's not so much the big fat programs but the little things such as what I listed above."],["Purchased for a family member that is an email/facebook/youtube computer user.  It is perfect.  Easy to use right out of the box, light and super fast."],["Good computer for the money.  Do your research before you purchase on because they are different than a windows computer"],["HP's Chromebook 14 is our third Chromebook because, after one year withSamsung ChromebookI came to realize that not only a Chromebook does almost everything a laptop or a PC or a tablet would do for me but it does it cheaper, usually faster and better, almost always worry-free and very much in style. We've ordered a nice HP Chromebook 11 since and now, because someone in our household wanted a one that was 'bigger', we went for the '14'.WHY A CHROMEBOOK?There's so much to say here but let me make a quick summary. And never forget that we are talking about an 'under 300' device here because, yes, anything that costs 3-4-5 times as much should do better most of the time.&#725; Our Chromebooks are our most used computers excluding work hours and by 'computer' I mean PCs, laptops and tablets.&#725; Malware, spyware, adware-free. Since nothing is really 'installed' on the Chromebook, I can't see how one would ever be infected. I am now using my Chromebook to open suspicious emails or click on dubious URLs that I don't dare touch from a laptop.&#725; Extremely safe OS. I don't know if this is common knowledge but Google is constantly challenging hackers to crack their OS. As far as I know, Chromium wasn't cracked yet.&#725; Easy to share among any number of users without any concerns of compromising privacy. If you have a Google account, you simply sign in and you are going to be within your own, personal environment.&#725; Constantly updated and upgraded. Google updates Chromium every few weeks and I found my Chromebook actually getting better all the time rather than slowly fall into obsolescence. HP's Chromebook will not replace Samsung's, it will be used by another family member who really, really wanted one after watching my happy relationship with our first one.&#725; Nearly maintenance free. Whenever I don't use a tablet or even a laptop for a while, they tend to get very busy for a while once I turn them back on. Tablets, especially, are almost impossible to use until all those dozens of updates/upgrades process. Not the case for Chromebooks. Whatever upgrades may take place don't hit my Chromebook. Whenever I call up an app, I get it in its latest version.&#725; The attached keyboard helps a lot. Yes, you can pair a keyboard and even a mouse to a tablet but the Chromebook's keyboard is always there, it negates the need of a stand or even some protecting case.&#725; Chromium is streamlined and efficiently focused where it matters, on the everyday uses most of us need a 'computer' most of the time.&#725; Chromium being such a streamlined OS, browsing and running apps on a Chromebook is in fact faster than off a PC/laptop/tablet of equivalent specs.&#725; Relatively low prince, 11.6\" display and light weight seem to be just about right for something that typically you'd be using to browse the Web while watching TV or take to and from school.WHY NOT A CHROMEBOOK?Yes, Chromebooks can't do everything. Google's productivity suites notwithstanding, they are mainly and they are best at media consumption rather than production. Nobody should buy a Chromebook and expect to be able to edit video or perform some heavy word processing or do some hard-core gaming. There are other machines and devices for such tasks. My experience is that a Chromebook can't do 'everything'. Tablets are more portable, PCs and laptops are more powerful but, to me, my Chromebook is the most fun to use and it's likely to stay this way. I am not going to call it my 'second' or 'third' or 'first' computer but, objectively, it's the one most use outside business hours if what we measure is 'hours'.HP's CHROMEBOOK 14 vs. Chromebook 11Having owned two other Chromebooks already, from the start, it was a very familiar feeling. HP's 14 is not 'exactly like' Samsung's and this big HP is quite different from HP's Chromebook 11 but it's easily recognizable as a Chromebook.Here are some changes:&#725; DISPLAY: HP 11's colors are sharper and brighter and you can view the screen from almost any angle left/right or up/down. HP 14's is not as bright and the larger size doesn't come with better resolution.&#725; KEYBOARD. It's a draw. I like both keyboards as they have a good layout and nice travel. As a touch typist I am comfortable with both.&#725; DESIGN: HP 11's is more stylish design but they are both Okay as far as I can tell. HP 11 is nicer though.&#725; PORTS: This is where the HP 14 wins big time. It comes with USB 3.0 ports vs. HP 11's USB 2.0 and full HDMI.&#725; POWER: It's not too obvious but yes, the HP 14 is sometimes faster refreshing screens. Videos play equally smoothly on both.&#725; SIZE AND WEIGHT: HP 14 is a lot heavier so if you travel and size and weight matters then HP 11 is the right choice. If your Chromebook is mostly homebound and most of your computing and media playing takes place in a room shielded from direct or indirect sunlight then the HP 14 gives you the bigger display advantage.Overall I like HPs larger Chromebook. It has better ports options than the HP 11, it's faster and you get a bigger screen on a body that's not as light and pretty.RATINGI am not going to compare a 300 dollar HP Chromebook with the Pixel or some top of the line laptop. I noticed that many 'pro' reviewers are complaining because Chromebooks and this particular one are not 'high end' and aren't as nice as the Pixel and such. Well... did anyone check the prices? So, yes, let me make a 'duh' statement: this Chromebook is not as good as devices that sell for 3 times or 4 times as much so anyone who doesn't mind paying more should pay more and get one of those. Even though... look at some reasons above for why one my prefer a Chromebook to a laptop or a tablet, regardless of price.HP's 14 is a four-star to me because it's at least as good and in some way better than my now one year old, often used and much trusted Samsung but I personally prefer the HP 11. As far as performance, they both appear to be up to the task and they both played Netflix movies flawlessly over Wi-Fi and cast them to the big TV through Chromecast.Chromebooks are not for everyone and they are not a universal computing device but, if used for what they are meant to be used, they are as good and as revolutionary as tablets."],["In short, looks and feels expensive and nice.  When it comes to doing stuff, especially the internet, it's strange having a computer that actually works!  (and, it's 2014 -- my other computers  swallowed up in viruses within weeks and become stupid).  The main problem so far is that getting stuff onto \"Google Drive\" or anywhere on the 100gb storage, borders on a trip back to the 1990s.  Nostalgic, yes, but c'mon.  I have figured that it's going to take me weeks upon weeks to upload probably about 40gb of pictures, all with a very difficult user interface.  Today, it took 9 hours to \"upload\" 200 pictures onto Google Pictures (using my external hard drive plugged into the chromebook).  It finally said \"Your pictures have loaded,\" yet they're nowhere to be found.  I've tried multiple pathways, too (e.g. loading them from my desktop straight to the cloud, loading them onto drive versus pictures, etc...).  A google search revealed that, indeed, this is a common and inexcusable problem.  I'm keeping the chromebook, but I'm going to have to have something uploading to the cloud every night while I sleep for, I imagine, about three weeks, just to get my crap onto the cloud.  Boo to that.Addendum: I was hoping I'd be able to write a positive addendum.  Finally, I was able to find the right combo to quickly upload pictures to the cloud.  Basically, I brought the Chromebook and my external hard drive to my office and, for some reason, it's loading super fast and I'm flying through hundreds of old photos.  Also, I showed my college student the chromebook today and she was very impressed.  She said she actually does all her papers on Google Docs and she can e-mail them to anyone as MS Word documents.  Both her college and my other daughter's college use Google Mail and Google services now, so I do feel for once I'm on the good side of things.  So, I'll go ahead and change it from 4 to 5 stars, although really it 4.5 because the interface is still confusing."],["REVIEW: Just purchased the HP Chromebook 14 direct from HP (Not from Amazon). I paid $349.99 for the T-Mobile 200 Mb of FREE Data for life. Chromebook setup was super fast and easy. I find it's better sometimes to spend the extra money to buy it new and direct to ensure no hassles or problems.PROS:Start-up time: Roughly 5 secondsShut-down time: Near Instant (1-2 seconds)Feels solidly builtSmooth Transitioning between Chrome Tabs, Chrome Apps, etc. - Chrome runs smoother and quicker than on a Windows machine.Web Browsing seems spiffy and slick.The 14\" inch is just big enough for my HUGE HANDS and still feels comfortable.VERY quiet and does not get hot at all, even when my pants block the ventilation holes.Chromebook has a setup guide that shows you all the tricks and tips as far as shortcuts and utilizing the touch-pad.There is NO RIGHT CLICK BUT you can use TWO fingers on the touch-pad to perform a right click where ever you need to, very convenient and I find it works quicker than right clicking.UPDATES are incredible. Compared to normal Windows updates, the Chromebook will restart to complete updates in nearly 5-6 seconds. So nice not having to wait to \"CONFIGURE WINDOWS UPDATES\" which can take centuries to finish and I've had crash before. This Chromebook is sweet and simple.Before you give Chromebooks a \"bad\" review. Please do your research before hand and understand what you're buying. I did my research as far as replacement apps, determining my usage and examining all the features of a Chromebook. I'm a bigger guy so I purchased the 14\" over the smaller Chromebooks, otherwise it would be too small to type on.CONS: None so far. It's not windows and I knew that before buying it. If there had to be a CON - it would be that it looks like a MAC lolOverall: Very pleased with my purchase. I will definitely look into additional Chromebooks and the Chromebox as well. Thanks Google."],["I just received my chromebook yesterday, and I absolutely love it so far.

I didn't need a fully-loaded Macbook (neither could I afford one), since I could still use iTunes on my desktop when needed.  I had already been working solely off Google Chrome, as well as Google Docs and using Spotify (which, by the way, are the best), so I knew that a Chromebook would be the perfect fit for me.I bought the Chromebook 14 about 4 weeks ago now, and can honestly say it is one of the best purchases I have ever made.  It fits all my needs and more, and is very easy and convenient to take to school and back.  It turns on in seconds and holds a full charge for about 7-8 hours.  The keyboard and trackpad are very high quality, and coming from using a wireless mouse with my desktop, find it quicker and easier to use a trackpad.  This laptop overall has a very chic and sleek appearance, and DEFINITELY feels and looks more than $300.Overall, this is an EXCELLENT product for any student or someone who needs a secondary computer, or even on its own.

We included a wireless mouse, and a USB drive so they could pull all of the files from their old mac and PC laptops.And today we bought a third one, this time with the 4G connectivity for my wife.

My wife uses it mostly for email and internet. Perfect!! Fast, reliable, not heavy, easy. Highly recommended if you use google and gmail."],["Love it. No hassles and worries with viruses and updates."],["I have been using Windows since Windows ME back when I was in middle school plus Macbook when I started earning enough money to buy one and I love both processors. Sure, Windows have some kickbacks such as vulnerability to viruses and whatnot but being a folk who has been using Windows since the beginning, I am used to purchasing anti-virus software every year to protect my machine. Anyway, not the point of the review. Then came the Chromebook, which I have been curious about since it first came out but I never had the need to buy one because I use a lot of applications that are not available to use on the Chromebook, such as Photoshop (there may be an app for purchase, but why buy a separate app when I already paid $500+ for the software already?). However, the time finally came when my mom started watching Korean dramas using her iPhone, which I thought was a bad idea when she follows 20+ episodes a week. I suggested that she buy a laptop for this purpose so I went browsing on Amazon to find an affordable, simple, yet sturdy laptop. The idea of a Chromebook popped into my head so I started looking into the Chromebooks that came out this year. Obviously the colorful laptops by HP caught my eye. After reading the specs and various reviews online about this particular Chromebook, I became convinced that this may be the laptop for my mom, who will mainly just be using the laptop for online streaming purposes, no need for anything too fancy. Plus, HP has been a trusted brand of mine after having own several desktops made by the company. I went ahead and ordered the computer.Setting up was super easy. I was already a frequent user of the Chrome browser, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Play, and sometimes Hangout. I simply had to log onto Google with my email address after setting up the Wi-Fi network, then viola, ready to go within 2 minutes! The machine is fast, the screen resolution is clear and vibrate. Since Chromebooks are simple, the software functions are easy enough to understand. Basically clicking any apps triggers the Chrome browser and you simply do everything on Chrome. You are able to save things easily into folders.The keyboard also provide several useful buttons including back history/forward history buttons, brightness adjustment, volume, etc. Speaking of volume, the audio is fair, nothing like Beats but not shabby. Exterior is very nice, the top shell is a sort of rubberized material while the bottom has more of a bumpy (to create friction?) hard, sturdy, plastic feel to it. The whole laptop is very thin, comparable to my Macbook Air. The feel of the whole laptop actually reminds me a lot of the Macbook Air, except for the backward scrolling (to scroll up, you actually move your fingers up the touchpad, as opposed to the opposite direction on Macbooks). Even the function of the Touchpad reminds me of the Macbook. Keyboard is a very reasonable size, not super small or super big.Overall, I highly recommend this Chromebook for people using their laptops mostly for web browsing, streaming shows, checking emails, writing reports through Google Docs, etc."],["The HP Chromebook 14 is a fabulous machine. Lightweight, speedy and w/ a long Battery life.It's particularly good when via Chronos, you can run Ubuntu alongside Chrome. I find Chrome useful for most online browsing. While Ubuntu gives me Firefox when needed, and a few local password keepers -- ex: password gorrilla.I can even use it as a thin client to a copy of Window 7 Pro back on my desktop -- For those rare cases when only Windows, or Internet Explorer will do.In short, the Chromebook is fast and cheap enough to finally make buying a new laptop worthwhile."],["We like the Chromebook, but have had to send it back to HP twice and have only had it for a month.  The first time the battery needed to be replaced because it would not charge.  When the computer came back the speakers did not work on volume settings over 40%.

Since I intended to use it during my business trip, I wanted to install Skype.  NOOOO... Google will not work with Microsoft to allow Skype to be installed on Google's Chromebook 14.  I returned this machine.  The return process from Amazon was smooth and friendly.  But the company did not process refund until I wrote a comment and gave the receiver's name and time to receive.  After this email, I got an email to tell me that their refund process allow certain numbers of days to process the paperwork.  But, fortunately, I did receive the refund a day later."],["My kids (8 and 12) had an older notebook with Windows 7 that was running very slow. I also spent too much time removing programs that should not have been installed, dealing with virus protection, and on a couple of occasions, reinstalling Windows. I was on the hunt for a replacement.I use Windows 8 at home and work and dislike it immensely. I did not want to deal with trying to teach my kids about Windows split personality (Metro side vs. desktop side). At school, the kids use MacBook Airs but these are out of our price range. So, for a replacement, I wanted a reasonably priced solution, good performance, intuitive interface, and something that required minimal maintenance. The HP Chromebook (we bought one with 4GB RAM, 32 GB SSD) has more than met my expectations. The screen size is perfect and the Chromebook meets all of my kids needs. My daughter is thrilled with how fast it boots up. The kids use Google Drive for all their academic needs, listen to music on Pandora/Spotify, have apps for photo and video editing, and found games they like. My son plays Minecraft and this does NOT work on the Chromebook so he uses my Windows 8 machine for this.Overall, our family loves the HP Chromebook 14. As a reminder, you cannot run Windows apps. If you surf the web and do most everything in the Chrome ecosystem, this is a great solution."],["I got this as an experiment.  I already have a thin and light laptop that I use for travel.  I love it, but the screen isn't the greatest and the battery life is just a tiny bit short and the fan (which runs all the time) is a bit too loud.  I figured for this kind of price I'd try something that's essentially similar, but maybe just a little bit better in some of these areas.  If it didn't work out, well, it didn't cost much and I don't mind having a spare machine.Well, it is just a bit better than the other machine.  The screen's the same resolution but a bit brighter and crisper and a bit less limited in its viewing angles.  The battery life is distinctly better.  The fan noise is still there (this is not a silent machine) but a bit quieter.  Keyboard etc. are comparable.  The one thing that's *very* different is the amazing speed with which it comes up.  Open the lid and boom, everything's there.  It's a startling contrast to any Windows/Linux/Mac laptop I've ever used.  Basically the only time I've turned on the other computer since the Chromebook arrived was to get some data off it.  The cheaper machine is winning, hands down.  That's about one third the price of what it effectively replaces, and that in turn was 30% cheaper than direct alternatives.The only downsides have to do with ChromeOS.  It works for what it does, and extra apps help, but there are gaps.  As a developer who works from home, the lack of a decent ssh client is a bit of a problem.  The absolutely laughable state of the VPN support - as far as I know nobody has ever gotten it working with any VPN server that wasn't specially configured to accommodate it - is likely to affect more than just developers.  Almost everyone else I know has flipped their Chromebook into developer mode and installed some other operating system, but I'm sticking with it because I have other machines I use for work.  If anybody's planning to use ChromeOS as a *primary* desktop environment, I'd recommend against it.  As a browsing/email machine it's awesome, but don't expect it to excel at much else."],["Windows 8 irritated me so much I decided to give a Chromebook a try. I wanted to wait another year on this, but my wife's laptop powering down for no reason, so I took the plunge, or she did rather. As it turned out, this Chromebook is awesome. I do have one complaint however. While the camera may have enough pixels to be considered HD, the image quality is poor, being dark and grainy. I plugged the USB camera that has the exact same specs from my desktop into the Chromebook and got a much better image. I know they have a price point they want to meet, but I would have gladly paid $20 more to not have to plug an external camera into it. I am definitely happy with the device and will buy another when the time comes."],["Do not buy this model; get the one with 4 Gb RAM and 4G capability for only $50 more. Although Chrome OS runs very efficiently and fast, having 4 Gb of RAM is definitely worth the additional $50 investment, which also includes 2 years of T-Mobile 4G service.I often have more than 20 tabs open on the Chrome browser, so the additional memory contributes to the overall smooth and fluid experience in using Chrome OS. As there is no memory expansion slot, You CANNOT add more RAM to the HP Chromebook, whether you buy the 2 Gb or the 4 Gb version. The RAM is soldered onto the circuit board.The suggested retail price of this enhanced model (HP 14-q070nr 14-Inch Chromebook (T-Mobile)) is $349, although many sellers may ask you to pay more than that. If you are not in a hurry, you can choose the one sold directly by Amazon and save money.I can guarantee that once you get used to using Chrome OS, you will not go back to Windows, or even Apple OS X!"],["I really liked my purchase but didn't fully appreciate how it really worked until I spent time with it.

It wouldn't work for me at all. I am not a fan of Google docs (probably since I have used Word for so long) but no offline document creation. That could be a deal breaker.2. Doesn't automatically connect to a printer.  You have to connect to Google Cloud Printer either a &#34;Cloud Ready&#34; printer or set up printing from a _different_ computer (PC or Mac) using Chrome to enable a &#34;classic printer&#34; to connect to Google Cloud Printer so the Chromebook can then print.  My mom will NEVER figure this one out. I find it an awkward solution when normally you can connect any laptop to a printer to print.3. I found connecting with the wireless network to be a bit buggy and not the instant connection I expected. It did get it to work and it seemed to stay connected without issues. I am not sure my mom could connect to a network as it wasn't THAT intuitive.4. I was underwhelmed by the selection of Chromebook apps available. It's a good basic list, but after using android apps on my tablets and phones, Chromebook apps seemed very limited in choices.Overall, I like the Chromebook as a glorified tablet for Internet, watching videos and email. And for people who just need a basic laptop without any bells and whistles, but that turns on and goes, this is a great option. For a working laptop for someone who needs it for work, I can't recommend it."],["We bought this for my mother in law when she moved across the country. She didn't want anything to do with computers, so my son suggested a Chromebook - genius! It's beautiful to look at and simple to use - more reliable than a Microsoft/PC setup that's always asking for attention and WAY more affordable than a Macbook.Actually, this is all most people need for a computer. People break the bank for Macbooks that have capabilities they'll never use. If you're not looking to work in Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator, etc. Get this instead of a Mac! And if you're not into gaming, coding, Linux, dual booting, etc, Get this instead of a PC!Let's see, what else... The solid state drive is great - so you can use it on the move without worrying about the hard drive. Graphics capabilities are pretty good - especially considering the price. I just wish that it could run Skype. We were a little bummed when we realized that we couldn't Skype (this is why we bought it), so we all had to sign up for Google Hangouts so we can video call with my mother in law. Hangouts does work really well, but not everyone wants to have a Google account. But I also understand that the Chromebook isn't a regular computer (entirely different on the inside - it's got a brain more similar to an ATM than a PC - no lie!) But I also know that Google is smart and I guarantee you that they will create a Skype App soon.All in all, we're really happy with it. And my mother in law LOVES it! She was able to use it right away - wasn't intimidated at all and she hasn't had a single problem with it yet. Great!"],["I love my Chromebook, I have a Samsung glaxay s4 and my phone directly sends google+ my photos and they show up on my laptop! Works great using it in a small business with small projects!

I think that strains my laptops when its constantly being used and opened and closed. The chromebook however was built specifically for users like myself. There is no hardware so there is nothing to load and its basically made for you to surf the net for multiple hours non stop. You could use this as a full laptop but in reality i think its a bit unrealistic. You say that now but trust me there will be days where you wish you had a regular computer.  They do have apps that can make up for reg software but for the most part they arent as good.

Using crouton, you can install a Ubuntu system which shares the resources of Chrome OS, allowing you to benefit from the solid wireless support built into the chromebook.  The only downside is that there is no way to setup a virtual private network, which you might need to access some secure servers.If you don't like linux, you can always use the chromebook to work remotely on a Windows EC2 cloud server running on Amazon Web Services.  I use the 2X remote desktop app to do so.

With all those specs, you would think it would be a smooth experience. It was not. And I'm tech savvy, I clean out my registry, defrag the hard drive, I even backed up and restored it to factory settings. Still, I got lag with just a few chrome tabs open. I was fed up.Which brings me to this little wonder of a machine. It has a low voltage dual core processor, only 2 GB of ram, and integrated graphics. Yet, thanks to the lite Chrome ecosystem, it cruises through everything I throw at it. I torrent music, have spotify going, tumblr, facebook, maybe 2 more tabs open, and it never skips a beat. I open the lid and it is available instantly. I stream netflix to my TV through the HDMI port, and it works flawlessly. I can close the lid and it still streams, which may seem like a trivial addition, but it really saves battery from the screen being off. Speaking of which, the battery lasts anywhere from 7 to 10 hours. I used to leave my laptop plugged in constantly, because the battery would last maybe 1.5 to 2 hours. Now I only plug it in for about an hour at night and it's ready for an entire day.I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who is sick of windows, and can live without gaming or itunes. Or hell, use it as a 2nd computer. It's cheap enough. Viva la chromebook!"],["My netbook was on its last legs, so I was in the market for an inexpensive laptop.  I was definitely nervous about buying a Chromebook-- I was worried about not being able to install programs like iTunes, Photoshop, or Microsoft Office.After a lot of research, I settled on the HP Chromebook 14. Big caveat here that I went to a brick-and-mortar store to buy the version with 4 GB memory.  The version I bought also came with 24 months of free T-mobile internet (only 200 mb per month free).I have not been disappointed.  This thing is very fast and plays HD video great. The battery life is also superb... I don't even worry about plugging it in most of the time 'cause I think the battery easily lasts for six hours, maybe longer, doing basic web surfing.  I have had no problems with Netflix, Pandora, or watching ESPN, etc.  The free T-mobile internet wasn't much (200 mb per month) but was a nice inclusion, as it didn't require a credit card or contract or any personal info to activate, and I can now surf the web at the airport, coffee shop, etc. if the wi-fi isn't free.  You'll burn through it in no time if you try to watch video, but it's nice for checking your email or light web surfing on the go.  Also, you can purchase additional data from T-Mobile once you use up the monthly allotment.I wouldn't buy this if you absolutely need iTunes or Microsoft Office... I've been doing all right with Google Music and Google Docs.  You get a ton of free Google Drive storage space to stash all your documents.  It's also got a card slot if you really feel the need to carry a ton of files around with you.  I bought a 64 GB card but I haven't really been using it for anything, to be honest.My only complaint so far: When this Chromebook is plugged into several of the power outlets at my girlfriend's apartment, the touchpad stops working.  It'll work fine again once it's unplugged.  This has only happened so far at this one apartment.  If you search online, you'll see that some other people have been having similar issues.That being said, I love this Chromebook."],["I picked up a snow white 4GB RAM + 4G T-Mobile model from Walmart for $349 (plus sales tax).Beautiful machine. Solid build. Very fast - much faster than my Samsung 11\" Chromebook. Great keyboard too. And nice large screen.I don't know why some say the screen is not bright enough or sharp enough. It's plenty bright and sharp. It's much better than the Samsung 11\" screen. Granted, this HP 14\" screen is not as tack sharp as some high resolution screens I've had in $2,500+ notebooks in the past, but then this system is not $2,500, or even $1,000. Due to some online comments I had read, I was concerned about the screen before I bought it, but I am VERY happy with it!My only knock on the system was that, initially, it did not appear to support a wireless mouse. When I first booted it, neither of my two Logitech M325 mice would work. On my second boot, however, the system's Chrome OS did an automatic \"update\", and the wireless mouse started to work fine! And it's been working flawlessly ever since! Woohoo!I must say, dollar for dollar, this is the best computer I've ever had. When I think of the $2,500+ I paid for notebooks in the past, I want to cry.More, unlike the smaller Chromebooks, like my 11\" Samsung (which by the way is great and is being used by my daughter for school), this HP 14\" baby can actually serve as a desktop replacement.I'd give it 6 stars if it was an option.UPDATE: Microsoft is now so afraid of the Chromebook that it has hired the two old fat guys from the show \"Pawn Stars\" (who know diddly about computers) to trash the Chromebook in an ad!

I have to pull Google Drive up on my phone to print from my Chromebook.  So when I try to take a class online and I want to print the page or attachments, it spools to the Cloud somewhere.

At $349, the HP 14&#8221; Chromebook is the perfect solution.The HP 14&#8221; Chromebook also comes with 200MB of free 4G T-Mobile Data each month - for two years - not a lot of data, but if you&#8217;re not at home or at a hotspot and need to check something out, this is a nice feature.Back to basics - The 4G 14&#8221; HP Chromebook feels, looks, and acts a lot like a MacBook. In some respects it&#8217;s even easier since the whole OS is the Chrome browser.  There are &#8220;settings&#8221; but they&#8217;re pretty easy to figure out, so it&#8217;s really quick to acclimate to the differences.The keyboard is excellent and the keys have a nice rubbery texture feel - a good thing, no complaints.  The trackpad is a bit wacky at times and it can indiscriminately click on something as you guide the cursor across the screen.  It also isn&#8217;t perfect at highlighting, but it&#8217;s not bad.  There are also some limited gestures - two finger swipe to the next page and two finger drag up and down.  I have also stumbled onto a &#8220;CTRL - two finger swipe&#8221; that enlarges and minimizes the onscreen display - kinda like the MacBook pinch and expand gesture.  It&#8217;s very sensitive, but it works and I use it often.  DIdn&#8217;t find any documentation on it btw, but it does work.The outside surface behind the monitor is a white matte finish (white on my machine) and there is a 1&#8221; (or so) silver HP logo in the middle.  The matte finish is a bit shiny from the oil on fingertips.  I haven&#8217;t tried cleaning it yet because I&#8217;m a bit apprehensive on what would work best, but it&#8217;s not really too noticeable except at an angle, so I&#8217;m waiting.  I also like the white bezel around the screen and it has a small silver logo centered on the bottom edge.  The bezel also has a thin 1.5&#8221; rubber bumper on each side and a long 12&#8221; rubber bumper along the top with a the web cam mounted in the lid.  Going with the Google pastel colors, I have a high tech yellow bandage over the web cam, so no opinion re it&#8217;s quality/use.  The screen itself is good from most angles, but I notice a &#8220;negative&#8221; type image at extreme angles.  That said, I don&#8217;t look at the screen at extreme angles, so it&#8217;s not really a big deal unless I&#8217;m trying to show someone something.  The area around the keyboard is silver, it looks like metal and feels good so although I can&#8217;t imagine why it isn&#8217;t white, but it is silver on all the models - wonder why? haha  The bottom of the laptop is a white textured rubbery coating and it still looks like new almost a month later, because there are four rubbery feet that lift it off the desk.The left side (back to front) has a Kingsington lock point, HDMI port, two USB ports, an audio in/out jack and an LED on light. On the right side are (back to front) power port (with a 90 degree angle plug), an SD Card slot, a USB port, and the 4G mini card slot (which came installed and preconfigured).  The bottom has nine screws and four rubbery feet. There are two audio &#8220;slots&#8221; and two perforated heat screens (molded into the body).Overall the laptop has a great feel, solid, and gives the impression of quality.The 4GB memory, which is only on the 4G model, also handles video/multiple windows without any noticeable impact (unlike the 2GB memory model I had before - an 11&#8221; Samsung).When I first got the Chromebook, I was a little bit apprehensive about its capabilities and although it isn&#8217;t a powerhorse like a MacBook, it is certainly capable of handling day to day needs and it has become a fast friend that filled a gap in my mobile needs.  My vision is much better suited to the 14&#8221; screen and I like the real estate to spread out as well. I also don&#8217;t like the portable keyboards used with tablets, so the full size keyboard of the Chromebook is a a big bonus as well.Google Chrome offers a &#8220;dock&#8221; along the bottom to position your favorite apps (I haven&#8217;t figured out how to relocate it to the side or even if it can be).  A couple nice features about the browser are that you can click and drag a &#8220;tab&#8221; to create a new window and you can also drag a window to the side and it will auto-anchor it.  That last feature however, gets in the way sometimes if you&#8217;re trying to set up two windows side by side. But, it&#8217;s no big deal.AppsiCloud works well on the Chrome browser and I&#8217;m also able to use the beta versions of iWork, although when I open those apps, I get a disclaimer that they may not be fully functional in my browser - none the less, they seem to work well.  iCloud mail, also works without any problems.The Chrome Web Store offers a lot of apps that, like the AppStore allows you to use them for free.  I don&#8217;t even know if they have ANY that cost or at least I don&#8217;t remember seeing any.  I originally thought the Android apps would work on a Chromebook, but it was just a misunderstanding - they do not.Before I close I also wanted to say that I also considered going to a full feature Windows machine, but I thought going to Chrome would be a lot easier than learning Windows 8 and that was a good decision. Along with the free software, automatic updates, and built in security with everything going through Google, Chrome OS is a great alternative to Windows, Chrome is easy to learn, no drilling down to get to settings, so even if you don&#8217;t know where something is, it&#8217;s not that far removed.  Overall Chrome OS is great and if you&#8217;re looking for a second computer to supplement your Mac, join the Chrome cloud, I seriously doubt you would be disappointed, it&#8217;s turned out to be a very nice computer."],["likes: It's fast, and has all the things I need as a student!

I'm using the chromebook in the same room as my modem and router and I'm mere inches away from them, but the connection gets lost. This does not happen on my sisters windows laptop, even though she is further away from the router and modem and in a different room...and she has a cheap laptop!However, this is easily fixed.

I'm a coder/application developer in a graduate research program so I have a linux server that I work off of most of the weekdays either from the office or via secure shell (in the chrome store) and I can remote desktop to my old windows and mac machines. I love the chrome app, it's just like terminal but doesn't have all the glitz-y add-ons that macs can get - so much better than powershell, sorry windoze. I was a bit skeptical of the Chromebook, but I have to say - I'm really impressed and I really love having everything (personal) in the cloud. I obviously work from multiple machines frequently and it was always messy to keep track of where which file went depending on which server I was working at or which home machine I grabbed because my husband was using the other one. Now I just throw everything in my 100 GB Google drive and I can access it from anywhere plus it's automatically at my fingertips when I open up my Chromebook. Do I miss word and other proprietary software? A little, but really are the freeware versions all that bad? Or are we absurdly loyal to brand names that continue to fail us?

A GREAT PRODUCT!"],["I bought the Snow White version of the HP Chromebook 14 for my mom because she only needs to check her emails, Google search and Youtube. But before she will receive it I had to see firsthand how is to be on a Chromebook, is it enough for me? And, to my surprise, yes, this is enough for everything I do at home, which is basically leisure/entertainment. So, in the following review I'll put emphasis mostly on the things other people reviews didn't cover well.First, for people complaining about \"ONLY\" 16GB of SSD storage, you have an SD card slot that can accommodate SDHC and SDXC cards. I bought a Sony 64GB SDXC Class 10 UHS-1 R40 Memory Card which is perfectly functional and very fast. SDXC cards can go up to 256GB in storage so you can have plenty of space in case you want to have lots of movies/music/pictures/documents available offline.The screen is very good if you don't want to share the content with other people who may not have the best viewing experience if they see it from sides.You have an HDMI port so you can see the screen on a big monitor (unlike the 11\" version of this Chromebook).Trackpad use is almost the same as the one from the macbook air  (pinching for zooming in and out is missing on the Chromie trackpad).I was very interested to explore the Chromebook concept and see how many things I can do online in the Chrome browser environment (of course you do not need a chromebook for that). The reason I write this is that a Chromebook is as good as the apps which are available for your needs. So here is my conclusion:In Google drive you can create documents, excel spreadsheets and presentations which are available offline. The complexity of the programs doesn't compare with Microsoft Office but can cover 99% of your needs. And this software is developing continuously.Reading ebooks: you can find apps for reading in the ePub format (see Readium, Magic Scroll and others). If you bought a Kindle book then you can use Cloud Reader to open it. But if you have .mobi, .lit and other eBooks in your personal library you'll have to convert them to the ePub format with an online file converter (check online-convert.com, which can convert any kind of file from one format to any other format, this is very important to know when using a Chromebook at this stage).Picture editing: use Pixlr Editing, but for a more professional app you can use Gimp 2.8, the free equivalent of Photoshop, and it runs in a Chrome browser (basically it opens in a new browser window so when it's opened it looks like the installed software on Macs or PCs).You can find sites online that let you edit your videos, same for editing sound if you need that. Chromebook can not open videos in wmv format but you can convert them to .mov, .avi or other compatible formats (see above, converter).Use Google Hangouts instead of Skype (If you want to use Skype (or VLC) you can install Linux in a chroot environment (Crouton), but this defies the purpose of using a Chromebook in terms of security, you have to let go old habits...).Now, can I use a ChromeBook for my professional work? Absolutely not! But as soon as I'm home, after a while, I forget I am on a Chromebook and not on my Macbook air (I didn't reach for this one for 4 days but I like it better because is lighter, well... for a price...).Remember that Chromebook is a concept that evolves in time, it's designed to get better, faster, more comprehensive and more secure as time passes. I am very impressed with what it can do today but you can only imagine what the possibilities are in a not so far away future.PS Does Microsoft have reasons to fear Google Chromebooks and Chrome OS? You bet! See, now you have FREE Microsoft Office available for Android and iOS..."],["I rate my new chromebook a five.

Advised when the computer will be idle for more than 30 minutes to power off.  There appears to be a problem with the laptop waking from sleep mode when not powered off."],["I just bought the 4G version of this for fifty more at the local W-Mart.  The other big difference between that model and this one is that the version with the roaming T-mobile data plan (free for 2 years) also has 2 GB more memory so theoretically the machine should be faster than the wi-fi only version.I'll review the things in common however.Screen:  Good size, easy to adjust brightness with dedicated up and down keys at the top of the keyboard (just like Apple).  I'm reading that the Chromebook 11 version has a nicer display and that the 11 was actually co-created with Google vs. the 14 which was supposedly designed solely by HP.Appearance:  I got the machine in white.  Snow White to be exact.  It looks awesome on the kitchen counter.  The aluminum cover around the keyboard looks great and reminds me of much more expensive Apple machines.  (OK I'll stop mentioning Apple, the whole darn thing reminds me of a $1500 Apple in appearance)Speakers:  I'm listening to Pandora as I type this.  Zero bass response but speakers still sound decent for listening to music, but if you want bass, this is NOT the machine for you.  There is a headset jack.Connections:  Speaking of jacks, there are two USB ports on the left and one on the right. There's also a HDMI output on the left so you can stream video and audio to your TV.Usability:  No, you can't easily run Microsoft Excel and Outlook on this machine.  I've read you can remote into your networked desktop and use them there but I haven't used that.  However Gmail and the Google cloud based equivalents of the Office Suite are fine.  This machine starts up almost instantly... it's like turning on a phone.  You turn it on and moments late you are checking gmail and Facebook and surfing the web.I wouldn't want this as my only computer as I do need a non-cloud based computer as well, but as an inexpensive mobile computer I find this a great alternative to my iPad at half the cost.I asked Amazon if they will be selling the 4G version of this and really didn't get a definitive answer but I'm guessing since WM is already \"live\" with it that they have some sort of an exclusive deal for now.Also, rumor has it that Toshiba and Asus will be coming out with Chrombooks for the holidays so you might want to wait to see what they offer.My biggest concern about this model was the 2 GB of memory in the wifi only version...  the reviews of other Chromebooks I've read (and I've read dozens) indicate to me that Chrome really operates best with 4 GB if you like to have lots of open tabs.A great little machine!!!"],["This is a quality product for the price-provided you have a WiFi source.

It took me 15 minutes to adjust, just putting it out there. 2- In the picture this thing is a manly blood red. However, there's a reason they called it &#34;peach coral&#34;.

It really stands out.Downsides:  viewing angle is not great.  Straight on it is great, but if you angle the screen in any direction you lose the picture quickly.  It is not great from the sides either.  The volume is decent, but does not go incredibly loud.  Fine as long there are not a lot of other noises around.You also need to understand that you are buying a chromebook, not a traditional laptop.

While this keeps the Chromebook ALWAYS backed up with the user's Google Drive it can also limit portability to areas with WiFi, any prospective buyer needs to keep this in mind.Quick Hardware overview:The keyboard and trackpad are both fairly well built and are easy to use for typing long papers or doing research projects. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same thing about the screen, which, while bright, suffers from horribly poor viewing angles that makes it impossible to share the notebook with a friend or colleague and is only suitable for the direct user. The lid is covered in a pleasing soft touch finish while the bottom is textured plastic, both side make the computer easy to hold. The hold and general transporting are made even easier by the notebook's general light weight. You will not find an optical drive here (Chrome OS does not support CD/DVD/Blu-Ray drives) but there are plenty of full sized USB ports and even a full-sized HDMI out.A Chromebook is designed for two things and two things only: light work such as word processing, making a quick spread sheet, or making a short presentation, and surfing the web. If you live within Google's world and use their products on a daily basis then a Chromebook is a good investment if you need a light and portable solution to a desktop but more power than a smart phone."],["I bought this for my wife; the desktop she was using at home died, and she didn't like using my spare tablet as a replacement,  99% of what she does on the computer is on the internet - Facebook, Gmail, shopping, more shopping - could be done on a Chromebook, so I pulled the trigger and got her one.I have to say, she found the Touchpad a bit frustrating at first.

I installed Steam on it and am able to play some of my casual games with my Xbox controller (wireless).UPDATE - I have since restore it with the thumbdrive I created earlier. I found that I was only using it for ChromeRemoteDesktop, General Surfing, GMail, PLEX, Chromecast, etc. I'm sure as more things come out I will try them out and wipe it again. You will never have to open it up to get to dev mode (a big plus). This Chromebook is fun to play around with and see what you can make it do.  I've read about people upgrading the mSATA 16GB SSD to 128GB.  Keep in mind.. this WOULD void your warranty."],["I first became interested in a Chromebook because my boyfriend had just started an internship at Google and they just gave this same model to him. He was telling me all the benefits so I started doing my research. I'm not too tech savvy (hence the reason for the Mac) but my Mac was creeping up on 8 years old and I just started grad school. I didn't need it to check out in the middle of that.So, that being said, I usually just use my computer for general browsing, movie and TV show streaming, and writing papers. Nothing outrageous. The Chromebook is perfect for just that. I am familiar with the Chrome browser so it was no big transition once I started browsing. I downloaded the app for Netflix and was well on my way with my shows. ITcomes with a ton of apps already downloaded onto it that I use on my Android phone so I am already familiar with them which is perfect. I was worried about the papers I write because they need to be in Word Document formatting. Google docs works perfectly for that. The documents and templates I use for school work just fine and there are not formatting changes that I am aware of. Google docs is just a much more streamlined version of Microsoft Office (even better for me!)The computer is VERY fast since you store everything in the cloud. If you are familiar with Google Drive or Drop Box this isn't going to be much of a shocker to you. I was able to upload my pictures from my Mac (and finally organize them) as well as my music from iTunes. If you are wondering how to do that, just go to google.com/music and download the Google Play Music App and Music Manager from your old computer. You can pick and choose what music you want to pull over once you have that going. Super easy! And then it's all set to go on your Chromebook.I like the feel of the keyboard. Very responsive. The trackpad is touchy, but you can adjust that in the settings menu (which I did). The settings are very easy to understand and change. I got the Ocean Turquoise color. Not a very good representation of the color online. It looks more light blue online. In person it is a much richer color. More of a green base. But very pretty! I like the color in person better.Overall, I am VERY pleased with this machine. It runs Linux and you can't get much simpler than that. Very user friendly and streamlined. Runs very quietly and is very cool (temperature wise). Shipping was fast. Two days and delivered on a Sunday! I was very happy about that. I'm very excited to use my new Chromebook more for school and everyday computing."],["This computer is perfect for me.  It's super easy to figure out, has a great battery life and I love the color.  Printing with my old printer was tough, but there are a wide range of printers (and prices) that will work for cloud print with the chromebook."],["I have a HP Windows 7 desktop that I use daily for my home bookkeeping business. My 9 yr old son likes to use the computer for the games. We were constantly at war trying to coordinate my work and his play time. I purchased a HP Windows 8 laptop from Groupon and disliked it so much I ended up selling on Amazon.com. I was reluctant to purchase another Windows 8 (not a fan of Windows 8) but wasn't ready to drop $1200+ on a Mac when all we need was a reliable way to access the Internet if our desktop was in use (by me of course). We definitely needed a secondary computer but without the thrills and frills of a Mac and more user friendly for my two boys. This definitely fit the bill. It was super easy to setup and the speed is equal if not better than our desktop. The one major downfall for us is that you will not be able to play Minecraft which is huge in our house otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. For us it works out great and the price can't be beat. I actually purchased from Walmart.com to take advantage of the FREE 2-yr T-Mobile data plan so if we need to take this with us and there's no available Wifi we now have a backup alternative. I love the feel of the Chromebook rather than the bulky and heavy laptop of our previous HP. This is extremely light in comparison and has the feel of having a Mac but without the hefty price tag. I am extremely ecstatic with this purchase and would urge anyone else who is looking for a laptop with simplicity and ease, this is for sure what you will want. Just keep in mind that it does not support Minecraft though there are blogs with instructions of running Linux but I'm not tech savvy to take that chance. If I'm not working on the desktop, my son can take over and I use the laptop to access the Internet and write product reviews such as this :)"],["DON&#34;T GET THIS!! i got this and it exploded and it summoned the purple cows from Jupiter!!

I've found that I cat get 10-12 hours of battery life by using this strictly in \"Dock\" mode. I connect an external (and larger, better looking) display, then close the lid on the Chromebook. The result is that the Chromebook itself uses a lot less battery power to simply send the signal to the external display than it would if it ALSO had to power the backlight for its internal display.The result is a machine that gives me all-day power for $300. Really, really worth the cash since I'm a web developer and all I really need is a browser and an SSH connection to my dev machine (available via a Chrome extension, w/SSH key support)."],["The Google system is such a pleasure, especially after using MS-based operating systems all these decades.

Just as an NYC apartment might be located directly over a popular bar, or across from a parking garage, or next to crazy neighbors, or not have heat etc. -- HP laptops are *always* undone by some seemingly arbitrary design error that makes you not like them.  (By comparison, the faults of Apple systems, annoying as they are, are usually interpretable from some marketing perspective.)The HP chromebook 14 goes one better, sporting TWO fatal flaws.  The first is the CPU fan.  It's always on, and emits a maddening high-pitched whine through the bottom speaker grills, which I guess also function as heat vents.  Users whose hearing isn't sensitive to higher registers will find themselves untroubled.  The rest will live in a constant state of irritable tension as they chrome-browse the net.  This could have been so easily fixed early on in prototyping, but no, nobody at HP thought it worth the effort.The second fault is the screen.  Yes, it's 14 inches, awesome.  But it must be the cheapest, crappiest, darkest, most reflective, least visual-angle-y display on the market.Many will say: yes, true, the screen blows and the fan screeches.  But hey, it's $300, what do you expect?  Well, I'm impressed by that argument as far as the screen goes (maybe...).  But I do not believe that HP engineers cannot solve the fan noise problem without serious impact to the cost of the kit."],["I was so pleased with how easy it was to set up and start right out of the box .

This is no MacBook but I didn't expect that. But it's also a much better Chromebook than I got when they first came out. The first ones were, IMHO, junk. They were built cheaply and looked and felt like it. This laptop is robust and appears to be built very well. The screen is great - easy on the eyes and the 14&#34; size is really pretty large considering I have been used to a 13&#34; screen. I can't run Lightroom or Photoshop on it nor can I run a local web server so I'll stick with a MacBook for that stuff. But I'd say this laptop can do about 70-80% of the stuff I normally do with a client in the field. The 3/4G is worthless to me because T-Mobile doesn't reach my part of the US.

This is definitely not a replacement for a laptop, and I was hoping that it would be. It does boot fast, is incredibly light and attractive and has an amazing battery life - depending on what you're doing, you can get eight hours or more. But you are limited on what types of files you can open, and you can't put any programs on it. You must use the Google equivalents instead; for example, Google Hangouts instead of Skype, Google Docs instead of Word. You can download web apps, but tablet or Android apps from Google Play will not work.All that being said, every Chromebook will have those limitations, not just this one. There are some huge benefits to the idea of a Chromebook, too. I'm coming to this laptop after having a MacBook for five years and refusing to get a PC, and it feels very similar to me. The operating system runs very smoothly and is not clunky in any way, and I love it. It's very easy to set up and figure out how to use. Everything you do is backed up to the Google Cloud, so you can access everything anywhere.If you fully understand what a Chromebook is and that it is NOT an adequate replacement for a laptop if you regularly use anything other than a web browser and word processing, I would highly recommend this one. It's fast, it's light, the screen resolution is great, and it has a much larger screen than many other Chromebooks. The color is really quite pretty, and the soft finish feels great. It also seems to pick up WiFi connections from further away than my old laptop, and I have not had any major issues with pages not loading or videos or video chats lagging. The speakers are on the bottom of the computer, which seems a little strange, but it makes things sound louder when the computer is on a hard surface. I've never felt that it doesn't play loud enough. There is a fan, unlike some other Chromebooks, so it doesn't run silently, but I definitely wouldn't call it loud.Finally, what sold me on this is that it came with two free years of T-Mobile 4g. I'm not sure if Amazon also offers this deal (I bought it in a store), but it's a great deal for the price.TLDR? If you need a full-blown laptop with the ability to install programs, this isn't for you.

But I had recommended this laptop to somebody, NOT REALIZING that they would need to print from it.  I had lauded only the features I had needed, and didn't even investigate something that ANYBODY in their right mind, would design into a laptop-like computer!  I just assumed it was there.  It's not.  Now Google has a \"work-a-round\" in that you can do \"cloud printing\".  That's assuming that you can make THAT work, because the person who is having this problem with their HP Chromebook is NOT able to get it to work, and so far NONE of the suggestions they have found offer a solution.  The ONLY way I have found to print from a HP Chromebook is to print to a PDF file.  At least they build that ability in.  Then I email the PDF file to a Windows based computer, and then print it.  I tested that, and it worked beautifully.  Considering that the HP Chromebook has an abundance of USB ports on it, surely they could supply at least a basic driver that would work with (hey, you specify which printers).Original review follows this additional update:I tried pairing the HP Chrome-book using it's blue tooth technology with a Bose blue tooth speaker.  First, I tested the Bose speaker using my iPod with a blue tooth transmitter on it.  The sound quality was quite good. The disappointment came when I tried using the blue tooth from the HP Chrome book. The music stored on the Chrome book plays, but at the beginning of each song, there is stuttering, and after a few seconds, it's like the systems finally catch up, and then mostly, it plays okay, but there are hiccups every so often. When I tried the Hangout function, placing a visual/audio call over the internet, the picture is about 1 to 3 seconds before the voice, which is very disconcerting. Yet, when I turn off the blue tooth on the Chrome book, the sound reverts back to the computers speakers, and then there is absolutely no delay. Conclusion for me is that the HP Chrome book has an issue with blue tooth, and it's simply not useable for conversations, and disappointing with music. Distance between the devices made no noticeable difference. It sounded about the same whether it was 3' or 15'. Because the Blue tooth does NOT work PROPERLY with the HP Chrome Book, I had to reduce my star rating from 5 to 4.  It's not a game changer, but it is disappointing that HP apparently did not test this feature properly.  I know my Blue Tooth speaker system is good, because it plays perfectly with an iPod using Blue tooth.  (ADDENDUM:  The Chrome Book and the Bose speaker work PERFECTLY WITH A CABLE.  HP might as not have bothered putting Blue Tooth on this Chrome Book.  It is flawed.)Original Review:I ended up not ordering this from Amazon because Amazon did not directly stock it, and therefore I was worried at the terms and conditions of some of the third party vendors selling through Amazon, which give the distinct impression that if you don't buy the second year of support, that they are not responsible from the moment they ship it, if it gets damaged.  Therefore I bought it from a vendor I like and trust to cover a product if it gets damaged in shipment.That said, this is the best laptop (like) computer I have ever purchased, and I will NEVER, EVER buy a Windows based laptop again.  Period.  Now I can \"get away\" with this decision because I only use a laptop for web access and email, and nothing more.  I don't have the need for Windows compliant software.  Obviously, your needs may be different.Best thing I've experienced with this Chrome-book is the absolute SPEED!  I lift the lid, and the system is READY to go in 2 seconds, or less!  I do NOT have to worry and wait while that clunker Windows operating system takes up to 2-3 minutes to load.  I do NOT have to wait for Anti-virus software to verify it's up to date, and if it's not, wait possibly 10-15 minutes for it to update.  I so NOT have to wait to see Windows patches lining up for about 20 to 40 MINUTES of downloading, installing, re-booting.  All that stuff made me loath even turning on a Windows based laptop (and the one I WAS using had a fast hard drive in it, and had 4 GB of memory in it, along with the second fastest Intel CPU.All the applications on the Chrome-book run flawlessly.  No problems and the \"learning curve\" is very quick.I very highly recommend this device!!!!(a couple of minor points - (1) the USB 3 slots are quite stiff - you may have to push harder than you feel comfortable to get say, a memory stick, in there.  That said, I had no problem inserting a 32Gb mini-stick in there with all my music on it.  The file manager came up immediately, and I was able to use the folders I set up originally in Windows to get to my music.  Once you start playing a song in the folder, the system automatically continues playing other songs in the same folder.  (2) I like using a mouse, but I can see that using the touch pad is definitely smoother, and faster.  I'll probably use both for a while, and see how that shakes out.  The speed of the touch pad is far quicker than the mouse.  (3) Gmail is just like on a Windows based machine.  It works pretty well, once you get it set up the way you like it.  My only reservation was that on my Windows based system, I was using Microsoft Outlook, which can be set up to run with several email boxes (accounts), and automatically downloads all the boxes on a regular basis.  With Gmail,. you can only have one email account.  (4) The screen size - I went with the 14\" because I had experienced the Samsung Chrome book which is 11\" and I didn't like the small screen because my vision isn't that good.  However, even with 14\" screen, I was straining to read web pages.  The solution is to set the display at 125% and that boosts the print of most web pages to be read easily.)"],["I've been using ChromeOS for years now.  I received one of the original CR-48 chromebooks for testing from Google.Over the years, ChromeOS has grown into a nearly full OS that can actually be your only computer.

Updates happen automatically and invisibly and it has a &#34;supervised user&#34; accounts to help keep track of your kids online.  You can monitor what sites they've visited, block specific sites, or even create a whitelist to have complete control.As far as hardware goes, the HP Chromebook 14 has two things going for it, that the others do not.  14&#34; size and 4G modem.  The 4G model even comes with 4GB of ram."],["I had been wanting a Google Chromebook for awhile, and did a lot of research on the different models before I chose this model.First, I knew it was not like your typical laptop. I've already got a Windows based desktop computer, and wanted something different. I chose this model because of the price, and had read really good reviews on it. I sometimes feel like I don't make the best buying decisions when it comes to electronics, but I have not once doubted myself for buying this Chromebook!This little laptop is fast! As soon as you open it up, it automatically turns itself on and it only takes a few seconds to do so. It's also really quiet, thanks to the solid state drive that it has. The hard drive space isn't a lot, but when I purchased it I received 2 free years of 100 gb of Google Drive which is great because I can also access the same files from my Android phone, and my desktop computer, or anywhere else I might be. The battery life is surprisingly really good. I watch a lot of videos (Netflix and Hulu) on this machine, and a full battery lasts over 9 hours for me. The screen is also an HD screen, and the quality is good. Movies, and shows look great on it. The only thing I could see that could be a downside for some people would be the lack of a disc drive, however that could be remedied with an external disc drive.All in all, I really like this computer!! I don't ever have to worry about security issues (viruses, malware) because it's safe, and it updates itself so I don't have to worry about that either. I use this computer many times a day, and use it more than my Windows 7 based desktop machine."],["As a college student - one that works two jobs - this little thing saved my life. Not only does Chrome OS run so much faster than my three year old laptop that cost twice as much money, it's a very efficient, lightweight, and simple computer. With my crazy schedule, I no longer have to freak out if I forgot that I printed and left my assignment at home or at the office. It auto-saves everything for me so I never lose work, auto-syncs with my account so the same document matches in all the places where it's saved, and I can access it from any computer.If I have anything negative to say, it's that there are still programs out there that are not compatible with the Chrome OS operating system. That means you cant use anything that runs off of Microsoft or some Apple Software. As time goes by, I hope that this will be a decreasing problem."],["I absolutely LOVE my Chromebook! It has a fast boot up and log off. I love the Google docs! Only negative... no caps lock button. But other than that, I'd recommend it to anyone! So worth the money!"],["Although I bought My chromebook 14 in the UK, it is not available on amazon UK yet, I had to buy it direct from HP. Like the T-mobile version here, mine comes with a built in HSPA+ radio that gives me superfast mobile internet in the area of London where I live, on par with wifi speeds pretty much. This is the first product I reviewed that got a 5-star rating although perhaps 4.75 stars would have been more accurate. The tiny flaws that it does have are balanced out by the stupendously low price, basically this is a machine you can easily compare to a macbook or a windows ultrabook that costs 4 times as much an it will still hold its own. Obviously this is a Chrome OS device so one has to do their research if they can live with a cloud-based OS and there is a very small learning curve when switching, but honestly Chrome OS is so easy to learn, almost anyone should be able to do it. I also wrote a detailed and critical review looking at every little aspect of the device, meant for chromies who are already sold on the concept but need comparisons with other chromebooks available on the market. For my money, this particular model is the best chromebook you can get out there, factoring in things like price, battery life, 4g connectivity and screen size. Without further ado here are my initial impressions:Initial Impressions about the HP chromebook 14 UK 3G version and comparison to the Samsung series 3Feel and QualityThis is definitely a laptop, it feels very different from the samsung, the weight is substantial, it is much bigger and the fan is constantly on and very much audible. I suppose I will just have to get used to the noise, but that is definitely a step back from the Samsung. Some reviewers noted they can only hear the fan when they put their ears next to the keyboard, definitely not the case with me, I hear it all the time when I&#8217;m in a quiet room. When I take it to the kitchen, where there is a lot of ambient noise from the fridge, it gets cancelled out and I can&#8217;t hear a thing. Most people probably won&#8217;t even notice the fan unless they use it at night in their bedrooms.KeyboardThe keyboard has a different feel to it than the samsung, it has textured keys and they keys have slightly more travel. Annoyingly, the keyboard is narrower than on the samsung despite the bigger size of the machine itself, so you get narrower enter, backspace and shift keys. The keyboard otherwise feels good and it is quite silent to type on, but not as much as on the samsung, perhaps that will change with time. The keys are not as rounded as on the samsung and I must say I prefer the typing experience on the samsung so far, but maybe I&#8217;ll get used to it in a few days. There is more key travel on the HP, that is definitely in its favour.TrackpadThe trackpad is the same width but slightly taller. I feel no difference in practical use, however the HP has a slightly loose trackpad that rattles every time I tap to click, which is annoying, so I find myself preferring to actually click the trackpad. Thankfully the trackpad requires less pressure to click than on the samsung and the noise is more satisfying. The loose trackpad feels cheap, I&#8217;m not sure if this is an issue with my machine in particular or if it is more widespread.ScreenThe 14&#8221; screen makes a huge difference in comparison to the Samsung, I don&#8217;t have to put on my glasses and I don&#8217;t have to zoom in or squint to see text properly. The bigger screen is the main reason I bought this machine and overall I&#8217;m satisfied. I did not find the lower PPI to be an issue, you tend to sit a bit further away anyways. The lack of an anti-glare coating is preferable in my case, text appears to be clearer and more crisp. The screen does reflect when switched off, I see no reflections when it is switched on, I keep it at about 80 percent brightness. Reflections from the blazing sun is not an issue we have to grapple with here in the UK. Maximum brightness appears to be about 10 percent higher than on the samsung, it is definitely noticeable and a welcome change. On the other hand contrast ratios are worse and colours are more washed out than on the samsung. Next to each other, the same background photo shows truer colours on the samsung, the setting sun is more orangey. The HP seems to struggle with contrast, for instance a light skinned person on a white background looks quite bad. Also, I find that I need to tilt the screen quite a bit back to get decent contrast ratios when writing and reading text on a white background, then when I watch videos I have to tilt the screen a bit forward to get better colour reproduction. It seems that constantly adjusting the screen is just something that comes with TN panels. But like I said, overall this is a pretty good screen for the price.Materials and Build qualityThis is where the HP truly shines compared to the samsung. This is a beautiful machine, well made, sturdy, quality materials, and the heft seems to add to the quality feel. The plastics used are much thicker than on the samsung, there is no creak when you pick it up. Mine is the snow white colour which is just amazingly gorgeous, I&#8217;m truly in love with the look and feel of this. This all comes at a price though, the bottom half of the machine is twice as thick as the samsung, the height difference is noticeable when you are typing on the table. As for weight, this is no macbook air, I definitely won&#8217;t be carrying this around as much. I plan to keep this for home use and take the samsung with me when I&#8217;m out and about.PerformanceI did not get the opportunity to test this extensively, so these are just initial impressions. My Samsung has increased scrolling performance markedly on the beta channel and when I go to google plus or the notoriously heavy Verge I see no difference between the two machines in normal scrolling. The HP seems to drop frames just as much as the samsung. Where I see a real difference is in loading times, pages load in about half the time on the HP and the waiting time to be able to scroll without jerkiness or checkerboarding is also about half of what you get on the samsung. Same goes for switching between tabs. Where the HP 14 really leaves the samsung in the dust is watching HD videos, there is just no comparison. The Samsung can just about handle HD streaming in netflix, but when it comes to youtube or other flash-based streaming sites, it struggles to play videos smoothly, there are missed frames, jumping and jerkiness. Also, I found that with the samsung switching between resolutions or going full window and back is problematic and really taxes the cpu. No such problems here, the HP plays everything beautifully, HD videos are crisp and fluid, they look beautiful on the large, glossy screen. Perhaps the only drawback of the glossy screen is when you watch dark scenes, you can see your own reflection a bit, but not a huge issue overall. The speakers are loud and clear, they are noticeably more powerful than the one on the samsung. Of course there is zero base, but they are still fine speakers for a laptop. Overall, if you like to watch videos and movies on your chromebook, the HP leaves the samsung in the dust, image quality, fluidity, responsiveness and speaker sound are all superior, but that is to be expected from a bigger machine.ConnectivityWifi performance is fine, same as the samsung, picks up signals easily. This model comes with mobile internet included. In the UK, as in the US it is an HSPA+ wireless radio. In the US this is marketed as 4G, in the UK this is considered 3G or 3.5G according to some marketing materials. It is faster than normal 3G, but it won&#8217;t be up to LTE speeds. The network provider is Fogg Mobile, a Swedish telecom company who have effectively outsourced the service to Three. I already have a mobile phone contract with Three and mobile internet speeds in my area are relatively fast (Wapping in East London), actually they are usually better than what I get from my BT wired broadband over wifi. Fogg mobile gives you 250 MB data per month free for 2 years, which is only enough to use in an emergency when nothing else is available. I will generally stick to wifi and tethering, but it is a good option to have and the sim is swappable, so you can easily get an unlimited mobile data SIM card from Three for around 15 per month which should give you constant internet coverage without having to use wifi or tethering. The only problem I have with Three is that they don&#8217;t always have their own masts, so when you head to central london you have to make do with the very low bandwidth that they manage to rent from other providers and at peak times that is nonexistent in places like the city. Still, you can insert a sim from any provider if they have better service in your area.I tested HSPA+ vs BT broadband speed in Wapping at 5.30 PM with no one else connected to the wifi network. Streaming speeds were 6537 kbps on three&#8217;s mobile network, almost twice of what is minimally recommended for HD video streaming. ON BT wifi I got 9837 kbps, which is around 50 percent higher but in real world use both connection speeds are fine.Battery LifeI had no chance to test this yet, at the moment I am at 90 percent charge and the machine estimates 7.5 hours of charge left, which seems to fall in line with what most people get. I&#8217;d say 8 hours is a reasonable expectation from this machine, but this will go down steeply if you stream HD videos. As for heat, the bottom of the machine is completely cool to the touch and it seems you don&#8217;t get the annoying spinning up of the fans that you get from windows laptops and macbooks when you tax the CPU. The Haswell microarchitecture really shines here.ConclusionOverall I am happy with my purchase, the HP Chromebook 14 is a significant step up from the Samsung series 3. What you gain in screen size, performance, quality and looks you lose in portability and weight, so you have to examine your usage scenarios to see if this is the right machine for you. My feeling is that for the time being this is the Macbook Pro of budget chromebooks. It is heavier and more expensive than the Acer C720 or or the Samsung, but it will serve you better as a desktop replacement and it is more suitable as a workspace. Built in mobile internet is also a huge plus in my eyes as unlimited data plans are becoming more common in the UK, so you could conceivably use this machine without ever needing to connect to wifi, therefore saving yourself a bunch on a wired broadband subscription. I think that the HP14 offers real value for money, particularly in the UK where laptops are significantly more expensive than in the US even if you factor in the 20% VAT. To give you an idea about the value proposition, the 3G model costs 279 whilst the Wifi only model is priced at 250 at the online UK HP store. To find a windows laptop that has comparable specs and build quality, you would have to pay at least twice as much, with apple you will have to pay 3-4 times as much. When it comes to chromebooks, the ACER C720 and the Samsung both cost 180 at PC World if you factor in the 20 cashback offer, but both have only 2 GB of ram. For the added quality and screen size, I think 70 is a reasonable price to pay if portability and weight isn&#8217;t paramount. It is also worth keeping an eye on special voucher codes, I managed to buy this model at a 10 percent discount, so I paid only 251 for it, there might be similar offers in the future."],["I deliberated a lot before I bought a chromebook since it can't do everything that a regular laptop does. However, being a student I was leaning more towards this since I already have a laptop (too big to carry around in a book bag). Overall, I like it since it is nice and lightweight and fits into my backpack without adding all the extra weight. (My school books are heavy enough!)  The battery life is excellent!This does seems like nothing but a glorified tablet, but I would prefer this over a tablet any day.The downside it that you obviously can't install any programs on this other than what is support through the google app store.  Sykpe is iffy on this and doesn't seem to work.  I can write to the other person but they never get my messages. If you use Word doc on a full size laptop you can use Google's version on Chromebook.  I found that if i use a USB stick and save my Word docs on it Google docs will open it and I can still type and save it on the USB stick for later use on my laptop. Dropbox also works well to transfer pics from the laptop to the Chromebook.  I have not tried any printing from the Chromebook, but I guess if you have a &#34;cloud&#34; supported printer it works.Overall, I am pleased with my purchase and the Chromebook!"],["Great product.

I am not a hardcore Mac lover, I think they're fine but I truly do not like Windows, so I thought this was a sufficient choice for what I wanted it to do. I do have a Mac desktop (and an iPad and iPhone's) that are used by other family members (often on and off all day for different homeschool projects) and I was looking for something for myself. No work, just play. A treat all for myself for once. I chose the HP Chromebook 14 for personal entertainment wants only. Nothing grand, checking email, reading articles, streaming (Netflix, Hulu and Amazon videos), Facebook game play (Farmville), and creating brief videos for communication. Essentially I can check email and read articles, that however is all I found it can do well, sometimes.Aesthetically it is very pleasing. The battery life is exceptional. It starts up lightning fast. The price is, of course, great. It has a generous number of ports. It feels nice, physically. I do like the Google Drive space and never would have thought to use it before. I am sorry to say those are the only big pros I found. I have only had it 3 weeks and I honestly tried to love it but I just could not.First, my (Aqua) HP Chromebook 14, for whatever reason, has an odd pale blue hue to the monitor. I find images not as rich and often graphics are ever so slightly distorted and not very crisp. I find it uncomfortable to view after a while, regardless of adjusting the brightness.A bigger issue, Shockwave Flash is constantly crashing. As in every few minutes.I made certain I wasn't running multiple versions, and so on. It just fails endlessly. I cannot play Farmville, which for me is a real deal breaker since that is one of the reasons why I purchased it.  I was under the impression that integrated Facebook flash games like Farmville could play on this device. I found this to be incorrect. It lags, it chokes, it crashes.In fact in my experience Shockwave Flash is crashing on pages that run flash ads or embedded videos. It just doesn't stop. Sometimes I find I am waiting (and waiting, and waiting) because it chokes, then runs, then pauses, then crashes. I never experienced this before, so I started digging and found Google Chrome doesn't play well with Shockwave Flash, at all, and a large number of people have issues with it. (check for yourself!)If I am *trying* to play FV I do not open other tabs. If I am reading articles I do often open a few tabs and go back and forth between them. I got the &#34;He's Dead, Jim&#34; message for the first time using the HP Chromebook and have seen it at least 50 times (or more) since, in the 3 weeks I have had it. Though I'm no fan of Star Trek by any means (though I respect it) I immediately caught the reference and it is nothing a page refresh cannot remedy. I have sympathy for those that it startles due to lack of knowledge about the reference or the immediate fear they received a virus (FYI you generally won't know you have one in your system).Streaming videos are a pixel blur of a mess. I enjoy foreign films but subtitles are now impossible to read. Regardless of where I try to view (as in internet location) streaming videos is like a modern moving Claude Monet painting. I have paused movies and resumed them on my (or another) Mac, and the TV via WiiU, Wii and PS3, and the same movie continues to play crystal clear. Not so on my HP Chromebook 14. I have adjusted as much as I can on my end, the problem isn't my wifi, it's the Chromebook.I do not like the app system, just my personal preference.The apps are neatly tucked in the bottom left corner. It's nice enough I suppose instead of all over the screen but my like for it ends there. I prefer to organize my apps to help keep things easier to find. Want to do that? Then you (oddly) need another app for that. You need a lot of apps for little things. Every time you install an app you are installing a web application that only works when opened in a new browser tab. This I do not like.I was hoping to be able to easily message other IOS devices, for which there are apps, of course. I find these apps pretty inconvenient, as you have to have them open and running in your browser tabs to receive your notifications, instead of a friendly pop-up somewhere. The same browser tabs that &#34;die&#34; while sitting open. If you're not following me, what I am saying is if the app tab is closed, you will not know you received a new message. Not a huge deal breaker by any means, just not as easy as what I am personally used to. I mean it's supposed to be a kind of instant message system, not e-mail. I feel that's comparable to taking several steps back with a brand new device that is intended to make things simpler. However that latter fault lies more with the app itself and not specifically the Chromebook. If you are not familiar with Chrome apps you, like me, may find them a bit backward.Another example being I enjoy making videos. No, not Skype. I do not need Google Hangouts though I am sure it's fine as a Skype substitute, but actual brief video communications. Instead of the ease of recording a video and being able to send it in a FB message to a friend (online at different times/schedules just makes brief videos, IMHO, for a better communication experience) now I am much more limited. Sure there are video apps, (like WEVideo which is annoyingly choppy) that one would have to install and create an account to use, and then request friends to do the same.No, it does not allow to easily share videos but does at least offer the option to constantly log into the app and check for new videos received. To me that's another step back.The amazing built in camera? I don't agree. Maybe there is something defective with my HP Chromebook. I certainly do not expect it to be on par with my year old Mac desktop, but I find the cam video and photo quality to be the same of an inexpensive laptop from years ago.I found the track pad fickle and sometimes unresponsive to double tap attempts to right-click. Luckily I was aware of this issue ahead of time and made my purchase with a USB mouse.I thought this would be more then sufficient for what I wanted. Kind of a different version of an iPad, without the IOS apps of course, but it isn't. At all. It's much, much less for me. I can't stream videos. I can't play the one game I enjoy playing (that I supposedly should be fully capable of playing, as it's a flash game on Facebook). Often I can't even load a normal page to read an article. I know I can install Ubuntu instead but I didn't buy it to install another OS. I wanted something fluid and simple. I do not feel I had any high expectations yet this left me disappointed.I think it would be good for a student or a very casual user as a second/back-up device but not much beyond that. I cannot even give it to my teen or tween, to use because they play games (Minecraft, Roblox, Gmod, Portal, Blockland, etc.) and, like the majority of their friends, Skype, so this absolutely would not fit their wants either. It's nice to read in some reviews that it did work out for others but I wanted to share my different experience. I really hate returning anything but I personally found my experience with the HP Chromebook 14 a serious disappointment and am sending it back for a refund (not replacement). Sorry HP Chromebook, it wasn't meant to be."],["I love this Chromebook, beautiful graphics, lightweight, easy to use.  It is well worth the money.  Highly recommend. It's a bargain."],["I was looking for a new PC to supplement my 10 year old dell (still works fine but slow as hell n will not allow me to watch videos) went on the blink one weekend After trying everything, I finally figured out that it was over heating because there was so much dirt in the fan after I vacummed the dust out it now works fine but is still very slow&#8230;.So I figured it was time to treat myself to a new PC but I wanted something portable.

I also knew I really didn&#8217;t want another PC because once you begin to download stuff from the internet, and with the cookies, your pc overtime begins to run slow.  And you also have worry about virus protection. Then, one night, while browsing the newspaper, while on the way home on the train, I came across an article on the Chromebook.  The article only talked about how inexpensive it was.  I googled it when I got home to find out more info.  I was clear that it was a limited system that ran on a google&#8217;s OS, but since all I ready needed was something that allowed me Internet access to check my email,bank account info and watch videos, it served my needs.  I also kind of liked that since it was a limited system that only ran on a Chrome Browser and did not allow all these downloades you did not really have the same worries about your system running slow over time and downloading a virus.  I also decided that I would only limit my Chromebook to watching videos and use my desktop for all else.  So, I checked on Amazon and came across the HP 14 inch with free 200MB of T-mobile.  I am not the most tech savvy by far so I did not really give to much thought to exactly how much 200MB relates to data usage.  I made the purchase from Amazon along with the 2yr protection plan and spent a little over $400.  It arrived very quickly (In about 3 days).  I was excited to get it open and get started playing with it.  It was a very simple set-up and the T-mobile Sim card comes pre-loaded so all you have to do is set up a T-mobile account and you are off and running.  Well, , I watched 1 5 min video and surfed the WEB for about 45 mins, then I got a pop-up from T-Mobile that I was out of data.  I went to the site to purchase additional data and purchased 1G for $10 which had a window of 30days use or loose. Over the next 24hr period, I watched maybe another 15mins of videos frm Youtube and did some WEB serfing (keep in mind that my Chromebook has been 2ndary during this time).  Well, 1 day latter I got another pop-up from T-Mobile advising I was out of data again.  This time when I went to purchase more date, the $10 offer for 1G was no longer available, it now offered 1G for $15 and was a 7 day use or loose window).  I made the purchase but knew that this was no longer a good deal for me. However, once I made the $15 purchase, I ran into another problem.  For some reason my Chromebook became super slow&#8230;so slow that I could no longer watch videos&#8230;..all the damn thing wld do was buffer.  I called T-Mobile about this issue they attempted to trouble shoot the issue, I was on the phone with 7 different techs for over 2.5 hrs.  Finally, the last tech I spoke with tried all that she could gave up and said there was no more that she could do, gave  me 2 phone numbers to HP and got me off the phone.  I waited 2 days for the charge to clear on my CC then called them to dispute the charge.  The CSR I spoke with placed me on hold for about 2 mins, came back and told me the $15 charge would be removed from card and there was nothing else I needed to do.  I contacted Amazon about returning this Chromebook.  Amazon set up the return and all I had to do was print the return label and the item was picked-up the next day and I had a full refund within 3days.  I then went back to the drawing board.  I still knew I wanted something portable and I really did not want a full PC because I did not want something that I had to worry about a Virus or a huge operating system that once you go to different websites your hard drive becomes slow because of cookies and all that other crap.  I then came across the Chromebox.  This sounded like it might be a good fit but upon further review, it was not, because this was a Desktop device and I wanted something portable.  I continued my research and then I came across a USB device that would allow me to use an Ethernet connection&#8230;..Eureka!!!&#8230;the music began, the sky brightened, I had found the answer.  Upon, further and deeper review, I discovered that what I needed was a 3.0 USB device that would give me 10/100/1000 speed capability.  I then found an HP 14 inch Chromebook without that  stupid T_Mobile for less than my original purchase.  I ordered this new cheaper Chromebook from Amazon, then went to Bestbuy and found a 3.0 USB by J5 create for $20+ tax.  I kept my receipt just in case I had a problem.  I received my new Chromebook from Amazon within 3 days of my purchase ( I did not opt for the free shipping route).  In fact, I received it on July 4th which is a holiday with no postal delivery.  The set-up is so simple a 3yr old could do it.  You just turn on your device, plug in the USB and it auto recognizes it!!!&#8230; Free T-mobile could be the way to go if you are gonna buy a USB adapter that will allow you to connect to the Internet via an Ethernet connection.  I plan to us a wi-fi connection but only in case of an emergency when the Internet is unavailable via an Ethernet connection.  In any case, I am happy with my new Chromebook&#8230;..connection speed is great.  I will update this review if I experience any problems."],["I was looking for a computer to surf the web and to watch movies on and do some e-mail. This is it.

I've not noticed any slowdown with lots of tabs open probably thanks to the CPU and 4GB of RAM. It boots from cold in 7 seconds and wakes from sleep instantly.I run 2X client along side the chrome browser to allow me to RDP to my work windows laptop and again all runs very fast.

I took his suggestion and purchased a HP with Windows 8.1 OS and Microsoft Word 2014.  I am a writer and finishing my second book. I have decades worth of research to compile and incorporate so it made sense that I needed a computer compatible with my Microsoft word files. WRONG!  That machine was a true pain.  It kept crashing.  Knocked me off the internet.  Had to reload data, etc. etc.  After 8 hours of trying to get it to work for me and my needs, I gave up.  I downloaded some word files from Windows XP onto a thumb drive and headed back to Office Depot to return the HP Windows 8.1 machine.  While there I plugged my thumb drive into the display HP Chromebook 14.  It was offline and google docs still opened my XP word files.  Sold!  I couldn't be happier.  I finished 28 chapters in two weeks.  My 2nd book is under editor review.  Even I was surprised I could work so fast.  But, the truth is this Chromebook is a joy.  The keyboard is large enough for my fat fingers so my thoughts just fly onto the screen.  Granted, I miss Microsoft Word, as it is so superior for my needs.  But, I figured out a way to write and then email my google doc files to myself.  I just open those up on my Windows computer, waste many hours reformatting text, but have a finished version to send for publication.  Hopefully, in the future I'll learn how to utilize google doc for those needs.

All work has to be done in the cloud, you cannot even save work to the machine.  (Again, per HP.)  So the device did not suit my needs.As big a problem, at least for me, is that the device--I assume all chromebooks--required establishing an account with Google (gmail, etc.).  I had to log-in to that account every time I wanted to fully utilize the device.  (There is a &#34;guest&#34; option but it limits use even more.)

Seems well constructed. It's my first laptop (only had a PC before). What I love most is the ease of access - no waiting for my PC to boot up.  I now use my chromebook 4-6 times a day, just grab it, open the cover and I'm on the web in about 12-15 seconds. Really easy and convenient and comfortable to use. The key board is easy and comfortable to use. It sits in my lap.Only complaint - no instruction on how to copy and paste using the touch pad. Almost nothing in blogs online, most people say go buy a regular mouse to use. That would be hard on my lap. Finally found one message that explained how - just press with your thumb on the lower end of the touch pad, and with the pad depressed, use the index finger of the same hand to glide the arrow over what you want to copy. Then the CTRL-C keys make the copy, and the CTRL-V keys do the pasting. I'd not used a touch pad before, but it only took awhile to learn.For anyone who only uses a computer for the few things I do, this is so much better than a PC, sitting in an upright chair for an hour of longer. Highly recommended. Now I can do my frequent research on the web easily. Someone should have thought of this long before now."],["I was really excited about getting a new computer. I loved the color and the style of the chromebook. Something I did not do before I purchased it, I did not read the reviews. Seemingly, I should have read more into the product.

It breezes right through my day-to-day tasks on the web, use of documents, photo editing, socializing, etc.As with any system, you'll want to tweak it to your liking.  I'm only moderately tech-savvy, but it's still been easy with (frequently free) apps and extensions from the chrome store.  So far, I've had no problem finding everything I need.  I've found games, productivity and social apps and extensions of all stripes.  Integration with Chrome on my android phone, tablet and Chromecast has been seamless!  I love being able to move from one device to another without missing a beat.  Want to double check that Google search you did earlier?  Grab your phone with the Chrome browser installed and you can pull that exact search tab right up.  Casting content to the Chromecast is a great bonus, too.  I also love the cloud integration.  I can automatically upload pictures from my phone, documents from the Chromebook, etc. right to my Google drive.  Again, it's all seamless.After using my Chromebook daily for a few weeks, I've only run into one instance where I missed Java - one of the common critiques of Chromebooks.  I tried to print a coupon that I didn't notice was java-based and, of course, couldn't.  Fortunately, fewer and fewer things require Java, so it's really not a big problem.  And since Java is such a security risk, I'm *really* not sorry.The only thing I'm taking a while to adjust to are the keyboard shortcuts you can/must use with Chrome.  Some are just convenient alternatives, but some are the only means to access a feature, like caps lock unless you customize the keyboard settings.  I highly recommend doing that.  Eventually the ol' brain will catch on to the new aspects, but until then, the help app is just a click away.This is the first time I've worked with Chrome as an OS and it's been easy and pleasant.  This is not the only computer in the house, so on the odd chance I need access to something on a disc or really need to use Java, I do have an alternative.

Last year we purchased 2 Samsung Chrome OS devices for our daughters. I was drawn in by the concept of an OS that you didn't have to update or worry about virus software and making sure everything was up to date. We also have a mac and a HP laptop running windows 7. So I'm well familiar with the different operating systems and there strengths and weaknesses. I particularly have issues with windows OS. My wife and daughter were always calling me at work with problems or programs asking for permission to update. I'm not an IT wizzard and know enough to be dangerous...lol Anyway I found it frustrating for all of us. I can say thanks to the Chrome OS ALL of those issues have gone away! No calls on having problems booting up, no phone calls on programs asking permission to update. No phone calls on system warnings about viruses and other stuff.I think a good way to approach the Chrome OS is looking at it as a tool. Windows OS is a tool that I use at work. I have applications that I need to do my job. My mac is another tool that I use for recording music in my basement studio and it works great for that.  Chrome OS is a tool for doing pretty much everything you'd do online. Email, banking, social media, Netflixs, Google also has been busy with the help of developers in creating offline apps if you need to do simple photos edits or listen to MP3's type a document. This is where my wife and kids do 100% of their stuff so Chrome is perfect for them. Chrome is perfect for me typing this review in Amazon and I use it exclusively for everything I do outside of my music stuff.Okay enough about Chrome OS and onto the Chromebook 14. Moving to a 14&#34; screen is nice compared to the Samsung 11.6&#34; screen. I found the screen to be clear and easy to view. In Chrome style it boots super fast, under 10 seconds and unlike windows even after a years usage it's still just as fast. Compared to my other daughters laptop that takes close to 2 minutes now to boot. My mac has a SSD and boots in about 20 seconds consistently. I love the Chromebooks size. It's small and lightweight at 4 pounds compared to the other windows HP laptop we own. The battery life is really good again compared to the HP laptop running windows. I'd say it's easily double the battery life. It's been an enjoyable experience so far.There are a couple things to be aware of before you invest in a the Chrome operating system. Be aware that you can not connect directly to a printer via a usb cable. This isn't an issue for us because we have a wifi printer connected to our home network and can access the printer via google cloud printing. Works great and I haven't had any issues with this setup. The other issue may be input devices. I personally like using a track ball instead of the touch pad. So this is a drawback currently to Chrome OS. I'm hoping as the Chrome OS gains margins that MFG's will start supporting the OS with some of these input devices. It's not a deal breaker for me just a minor inconvenience. Other then that I've been very please to date with the Chromebook 14.If any major issues come up I'll update my review. To date I've been please with this product. Fast and easy to use, no updates just boot it up and go. Can't ask for anything better then that.

The larger screen is very nice -- I really don't share the criticisms I've seen in other reviews about its lack of clarity.

There is no wait time for booting up, just open it up and the chromebook starts up.  Moving to different websites is so fast!  Rarely is there problem opening any site - once a site was very slow opening and I got a message on the chromebook asking if I wanted to wait or to kill it. I chose kill it, and I got a screen with a sad face and text saying 'It's dead, Jim&#34;.  That cracked me up! I really love seeing personality put into technology!

The ONLY thing I have not been able to do download is iTunes and hook up my ipod to the chromebook. But my ipod has wifi access, so that's not really a problem either.

This nicely designed machine is great for anyone who uses a computer primarily for web based work.  It boots up in seconds, has a nicely designed keyboard, a decent touchpad, a great balance in your lap, and was able to run all internet video and applications I could throw at it.  The blue color is more of a teal (according to my wife) but kind of grew on me after awhile.  It includes a small portion of free Internet data each month via t-mobile if you need it.  The display is not an IPS display like on an iPad or the Chromebook 11, but is still quite nice.  While the 14 inch size may be too big for some, it is great for adults whose eyes may be going.  And this thing lasts 9 hours of time without a break on a single charge.My only complaints were that the colors are a bit much, the keyboard was a bit too widely spaced for my fingers, and ultimately I wanted something a bit smaller.

It does have 2Gb of RAM vs. the 4Gb in the Walmart-sold version. It also has no sim card slot.My initial feelings are very positive. The size and weight feel just about perfect. Not too light/cheap feeling, but nicely weighted and portable. The keyboard is excellent. I'm \"upgrading\" from a Sony Vaio laptop and the keyboard feels very similar with just a bit of texture on the keys. Performance seems to be more than adequate, although I haven't tried to stress test it in any way yet. The Intel processor runs cool. I've only heard the fans spin up once for a minute or two, otherwise they run slowly and quietly. Battery life has been excellent. I have had to adjust to using the trackpad , but it seems to work fine. There are some settings you can change to customize it or there are plenty of USB slots if you'd rather use a mouse. Also of note, the laptop has Bluetooth built in.The screen seems to be the weakest feature. The positives are the size and the wide range of brightness settings. The screen can get very bright, but you can all set it very low and even completely off. The HDMI port allows for several display configurations. You can mirror the display, extend the desktop, and set the external monitor to be your primary display. On the not so nice side is the resolution. 1366 x 768 on a 14\" screen is usable, but not ideal. A 1440 x 900 screen would have made me give it that fifth star.My main gripe with the Chromebook, and from what I'm reading it maybe a Chrome OS issue, is the color temperature of the screen. The screen is clearly skewed too far in the \"cool blue\" color spectrum. I did some searching online and have found other people, using other Chromebooks, complaining about this as well. From what I can tell there is currently no fix or adjustments available. If you are into photography, like I am, be warned that the screen does not accurately reproduce colors like an Apple or Sony display.Overall I'm happy with the purchase. It makes a great \"around the house\" laptop or would be great for a high school or college student whose studies don't require special software (engineering, art majors, etc.)."],["I ordered this Chromebook as an upgrade from my Acer C7. I wanted this one due to the processor and the larger screen. I also tried out other Chromebooks and I found that the keyboard and the touchpad on this Chromebook felt much better and more responsive than other ones that I've tried. It didn't feel cheap like some of the others did.I really like the finish on the body of the laptop. I have the &#34;snow white&#34; color, and it looks really nice. The finish also feels rugged enough to handle a few scrapes. You're not going to see fresh scratches every time you run dry hands over the lid. The build of the laptop also feels nice and sturdy. It doesn't feel like, or easily bend, like a cheap piece of plastic. The speakers are also greatly better than the last Chromebook I owned. If I have the laptop on a flat surface, like a countertop or table, the speakers really give off a good amount of sound. They're slightly less loud on a lap or bed, but they're still great!This is my second Chromebook, and I really enjoy Chrome OS. I wanted this one due to the larger screen, but my original Acer Chromebook is still running great! That one now belongs to my wife.I use my Chromebook for web surfing mostly. Facebook, Netflix, Youtube, E-mail and stuff like that. I also use it for creating and editing Google Doc files, which can be saved as Word files when you export them!

It is neither as thin nor as light as my Samsung Ultrabook (but it did cost about 10x less).  And it uses an old school charger with the brick sized capacitor.

No downloads, doesn't support that sort of thing as everything is done in the cloud (web based) & the tons of apps via the Chrome store and the App store I use on my iphone. I was able to sync Google calendar with my iphone as well for reminders and such. No Windows environment to deal with (updates threatening to shut my machine down in 10 minutes) It can be personalized in many ways with desktop wallpaper and themes for the Chrome browser.I chose the aqua color which is nice, not too bright, it's a pastel green.

So far so good.Light, fast and super simple to use. Perfect for the technologically impaired, it's *almost* like having an iPad with a laptop interface. It's also great for techies who travel - if you dick around on your smart phone all the time, then there's a good chance you'll find this fun/useful. It's also shiny and nice, you just *want* to use it - my macbook pro is sitting in my backpack right now and will probably stay there until I have to edit my demo reel.Other stuff:The Google cloud situation really comes together nicely in Chromebook. All the usual google apps are now little icons in the &#34;start&#34; menu. User accounts are easy to manage and there's something quite lovely about having your preferences being loaded up onto your computer - it's essentially the same as using Chrome anywhere, but on the Chromebook it feels integrated. Also a nice touch - there's a local folder called &#34;google drive&#34; which syncs with the online google drive just like Dropbox.So far it's staying cool. I know there's not a lot of heavy lifting, but it's nice to have a laptop I can put on my lap (unlike my macbook pro). Battery also seems to last quite long though the hour estimates are wonking between 8.5 and 10 hrs at the moment.Network jazz is easy to deal with. Finding things like your IP and Mac address is all there in the bottom right of the screen, along with battery juice meter, chrome settings, and other stuff.My mom *loves* the color, the feel and the speeeed.

Buyer beware the firmware of this machine, as mentioned in other reviews, is the Chrome Operating System using the Chrome browser. You cannot install executables or apps from outside the Google eco-system just like iPads and iTunes are married with the Apple app store. You cannot later install Windows, or any other OS, or executables outside of the Google eco-system.I cannot get the DishNetwork's DISHANYWHERE.COM sling activeX plugin (extension its called in Chrome) so that's a minor setback. The plugin only exists for the Windows or Mac operating systems, not the Chrome OS. Slingbox has a Facebook app that is supposed to work in the Chrome OS that I haven't finished futzing with to say whether it works or not. The way I made it work is use Chrome remote desktop on a PC in the Chrome browser that's already been set up to work with DISHANYWHERE (Before you try a remote desktop to it). Make sure your audio is set to simple stereo using the control panel or there will be no audio sent to the Chromebook remote desktop. Surround = zero sound.) Establish the remote desktop on the Chromebook to the PC running Chrome and remote desktop. Choppy, but better than no access to the DVR (live or recorded) content.If your machine auto-updates (as they all are firmware set to do) and will suddenly not let you logon ever, CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+R, induces a \"wipeout\" back to firmware Chrome OS as installed at HP. The automatic updating after that worked for me. You will lose EVERYTHING that you put in the machine with this.Audio on the HDMI port can only be heard if your load (HDTV) has audio output. A 720p or 1080p HDMI monitor with NO AUDIO decoding capability means you have no audio at any time. Period.The Chromebook is fast, clean, simple, beautiful display, and configurable within the Google ecosystem (thats a lot for a travel machine)."],["Well yes! I made fun of the new HP Chromebook 14 (in Coral Peach, Turquoise and Snow White) when I first saw it. The new HP Chromebook line comes in pastel colors that they seemed perfect for a child&#8217;s bedroom. However when you take this beast for a spin, you may become inclined to paint the walls to match.This isn&#8217;t my first Chromebook. I own a slate grey Acer C710 with a 11 inch screen. It was hard on these old eyes of mine and I kept pumping-up the screen size to adjust. This Chromebook&#8217;s 14 inch display is just right. HP is known for it&#8217;s build quality and the HP Chromebook 14 doesn&#8217;t disappoint: excellent quality keyboard, speakers and an array of side port options such as two USB 3.0 and one USB 2.0 an HDMI port and an SD card slot for additional memory - Google take note! I love the Chrome environment. It does more than I ever use. At work I use Windoze computers and all day long I trouble-shoot Internet connection problems, password issues and viruses. Always Windoze, always windoze machines. Chrome is a pleasure to have because there are none of the burden of the Microsoft OS to worry about.There is no Ethernet option so it&#8217;s Wifi only, and the display pales compared to others I have seen. There are some trade-offs to a lower price, but I dropped one Star because of this.Yes, I bought the coral peach. Because I&#8217;m secure in my masculinity. Wanna make something out of it??!"],["I bought this device mainly because the retail price was very low compared to competitors and the device looked attractive and had a nice feel when playing with a demo model. Plus, I already used some key Google services (Chrome, Gmail and Calendar) so I thought it might be worth a shot to see how they operated on Chrome OS since in my experience software generally runs best on it&#8217;s native OS if created by the same developer (i.e. iTunes on Mac OS X and Microsoft Office on Windows). I've had this Chromebook for a week now and have had the opportunity to test it as thoroughly as I can based on the things I use laptops for. Below are the observations I made while using it and I separated everything into categories for quicker viewing depending on your needs. Before I get started I want to emphasize that you should use the Get Started app that Google provides and/or do searches online if you get stumped. If you don&#8217;t, then you will get frustrated and just want to get rid of it. A few times I said this OS sucked but after researching it I was able to figure out how to accomplish my task at hand by reading directions, imagine that!Media Files: On day one I tested it by watching numerous mp4 files I had stored on an SD card. I popped the card in (which does not stick out from the side of the machine) and the file browser popped up. I double clicked the m4v file and the media player that is built into the OS started playing the file. I also tried some music files I had stored on a USB drive and it worked the same way with the file browser opening up and the built in player launching upon double clicking the file. I have my music collection encoding using iTunes so they are AAC m4a files, which confirms Google&#8217;s claims that these file types are supported. iTunes users should feel comfortable migrating to this environment. See this page for other supported media types: [...]Microsoft Office: It appears that Google is trying to cover all their bases with \"basic\" tasks by including Google Docs, Spreadsheets and Slides as Microsoft Office alternatives and with a little time learning the interfaces you should be able to do all the basic functions in these apps. There is also an offline option to work on your files without an internet connection which worked fine but I quickly found out that documents can be edited but spreadsheets are &#8220;view only&#8221; when offline. This is something that Google needs to work on ASAP because if I didn&#8217;t have a mobile hotspot this alone would be reason enough for me to return/sell it. So, if you don&#8217;t always have an internet connection and use spreadsheets a lot then this device and OS is not for you. I also installed SkyDrive which allowed me to edit Microsoft files in their web-apps, which look like the paid software versions but within a web browser. They too have limited functionality like the Google apps but you would be able to find things quicker if you are used to those user interfaces but you do lose the offline editing capabilities that Google provides you through their alternatives (though they aren&#8217;t perfect as I already mentioned). Google Keep is also offered and it is like Notes in Mac OS X or Notepad in Windows so you do have something for quick note taking and this works perfectly offline. I don&#8217;t use slide presentations so I can&#8217;t comment on that program.Apps: I feel a lot of these are unnecessary because most of the ones I've installed simply direct you straight to the homepage of that website just as if you clicked one of your bookmarks in your Bookmarks Bar. One advantage I see to this though as I used it more is that you can pin more of these apps to your Launcher Bar at the bottom of the screen than you could install on the Bookmarks Bar in your Chrome browser window. The apps also allow you to open them in a separate window which is nice if you don't want it to open in another browser tab and/or cluttering up the Chrome browser. Also, hardly any of them are redesigned in any way like you are used to seeing apps on smart phones. The ones that were built differently I felt just didn't work as well as the full site so I just ended up typing the internet address in the Chrome browser and removed the app. One thing that I liked that are present in Google apps on other OS&#8217;s that I saw was missing here was the speech input. On iPad I like speaking things I want to search for and that wasn&#8217;t an option in the Google Chrome or Google Search apps on this machine. I do see a microphone above the screen so I know it&#8217;s capable of hearing my voice, so hopefully this is something they add soon.Hardware: The build quality of this machine is one of the best I've seen at this price point! I find it visually appealing with the selection of colors they used (my model was silver/white) and the keyboard tray reminds me of a Mac wireless keyboard. This color combination also makes it impossible to see fingerprints. The soft touch material being used for the outer body of this laptop feels nice to the hands. It can take a beating too apparently because I already bumped it against something pretty hard by accident and it didn&#8217;t show a mark at all! Nice job HP! This device is also very thin and is competing with ultrabooks in terms of size, in fact it looks almost identical to the sleekbook/ultrabook offerings from HP. The device also has a nice selection of ports providing USB 2.0, USB 3.0, full size HDMI, SD card reader, headphone/microphone combo jack, Kensington lock slot and an indicator light for sleep/use.Screen: I did notice while watching videos that I had to adjust the screen angle a couple of times to get the perfect viewing angle (mostly for dark blacks). Clearly this is not an IPS display, but for $300 I guess you can't expect to get a 1080p IPS display. It feels very solid and doesn&#8217;t flex very much when I tried to bend the screen from side-to-side. The screen is also very thin and after applying pressure to the back of the panel to see if it would show through I glad to say nothing showed unless you were applying A LOT of pressure, which I&#8217;m sure most users won&#8217;t. I was a little disappointed to see that the backlit chrome bar present on the lid of HP 11 and Pixel was missing here. I think adding this would make a nice additional design element.Keyboard: It doesn't have much key travel but if you can train yourself to type softer then you should be able to adjust and make it a good typing experience (with devices becoming thinner this is just something we will have to make adjustments for). Also, the keyboard tray is solid and does not flex or trampoline at all. Some back-lit keys would be a nice addition in future models since ambient lighting isn't the greatest in most rooms I&#8217;ve used this in but the grey lettering on white keys helps to combat that a little bit. I love most of the shortcuts at the top of the keyboard such as the full screen, volume adjustments and display brightness keys but the back/forward aren't necessary with trackpad gestures and anyone used to using alt+tab to switch through apps won&#8217;t use the app switching key. I feel one, if not all, of these could be removed and shift the row left so we can have a dedicated DELETE key (holding alt+backspace isn&#8217;t quite as intuitive for people coming from Windows). See this site for keyboard shortcuts: [...]Trackpad: I was shocked at how the trackpad had a silky smooth texture to it which reminded me of a Macbook because my finger rarely skips across the surface. I love the addition of trackpad gestures and use tap-to-click, back/forward and scrolling all the time. The clickpad is only clickable on the bottom half of the trackpad and gets easier to push down the closer to the bottom of the trackpad you get. A full clickpad might be a nice change in future models.Hinge: The hinge to open the lid isn't as stiff as you find on 90% of laptops today which require two hands to pry open, however you still can't open it with one hand. Hopefully with more use the hinge will loosen a little more since one unit I tested in a store before I made the purchase seemed to be a little looser than the one on my unit. I personally love laptops that you don't have to pry open with two hands and this is about halfway there. I think if they put the hinge from the HP Chromebook 11 on this then they would have nailed it. I also decided to grab the laptop by the lid and shook it around to test how strong the hinge was and it didn&#8217;t give very much at all so I&#8217;m confident that it&#8217;s a solid build and won&#8217;t break anytime soon if ever.Accessories: I like that the power adapter is smaller than we are used to seeing with traditional laptops but at the same time I feel power bricks have become outdated and need to be more like tablet chargers having folding prongs built in to a cube shaped adapter versus having a cord going in and coming out of a power brick.Performance: So far from my testing the performance has been great. I wouldn&#8217;t think that using an Intel Celeron laptop would be something that I would brag about but I haven&#8217;t had any issues with things getting hung up or freezing. I&#8217;m not even sure why Google made the Pixel with an i5 processor because after using this I really don&#8217;t feel like it&#8217;s necessary (unless it&#8217;s for gaming which is something I don&#8217;t do on laptops). Web pages load pretty fast on my home network which is running on an ac router and I don&#8217;t experience any lag as I scroll down from loading images. Refreshing the laptop internals to have wireless ac built-in would be a nice addition in future models.Battery: Installed is a 4 cell battery and checking the HP website results in a 9.5 hour claim. After using it for a week and monitoring usage very closely here is what I found. I was able to get 4 days of use out of it before having to plug it in and combined use time was 7 hours. However, 1.75 hours of this was watching videos so battery life could have been better if just used for web browsing and document editing only. In fact, looking at my results and doing some simple math, I&#8217;m confident 9.5 hours is an accurate claim. For once HP isn&#8217;t exaggerating battery life claims! The Intel Celeron processor doesn&#8217;t appear to be built for extended video playback though because after watching 1.75 hours of files from a USB drive I lost 30%! So, doing the math this machine should be able to last close to 6 hours for viewing back-to-back movies if you are on a long car ride or flight. Not that impressive when compared to tablets but having files stored internally might produce better results. All these findings were obtained with active wi-fi and brightness set to 50% the whole time. Using the sleep feature by closing the lid or using the &#8220;shut down&#8221; feature in the bottom right of the screen or holding the power button seemed to produce the same drainage result. I found that after a combined sleep time of 75 hours I only lost 5% of battery life. I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s pretty impressive compared to Windows machines and leaves more battery for use! Charging time from 5% took exactly 2 hours to fully charge back to 100% which is great since my cell phone charges about that quick and I consider that to be the industry standard.Conclusion: Overall I am pleased with the device but $300 might still be a little high for something that only serves as an internet browsing machine since the spreadsheet editing isn&#8217;t where I&#8217;d like it to be for offline use. I will probably let this device go for sale on eBay though because I don&#8217;t need a third internet browsing device in my house. It simply doesn&#8217;t outperform my iPad because the iWorks suite has more offline functionality on-the-go and the battery life of this machine comes up a little short. For fully functional software I will continue to rely on my home PC. HP should allow add-ons or upgrades on their website for a backlit keyboard, wireless ac, IPS display and a tablet adapter (if they can develop one). As for Chrome OS, add the option of editing spreadsheets offline and I&#8217;ll give your OS another shot."],["The HP Chromebook 14 displays rock-solid video and audio with no glitches.

However, I'm still trying to decide whether or not to return this item.  This is my third unit and the two things that I like the least about the HP 14 are the fan noise, which runs all the time and is noticeable, and the occasional pixelated screen with concentric circular lines when streaming videos.  I have had this problem with all the units to some degree when streaming YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime and even from a USB flashdrive.  I have not been able to find any reference to this issue in any of the online reviews or the HP website and after testing three units I find it hard to believe that I'm the only one having this problem.  I'm learning to live with the fan noise but the video streaming artifacts may be a deal breaker.  If I can fix the screen pixelation issue, I would easily give it 5 stars.Update:  After further investigation I found that some of my other tablets are doing the same thing...so the good news is that there is not a problem with my HP Chromebook so I have increased the rating to 5 stars.

I have used my HP Chromebook 14 for almost a week now and I think I am really going to like this notebook the more I use it but there are a couple of things that nag at me ever so slightly.First, the RAM in the computer is not upgradeable. The models I purchased had two gigs of RAM in them and those modules are soldered on to the motherboard. This means no upgrading done by me down the road. I cannot complain a lot because the chromebooks only cost $300 but it was something that I wish I could do in order to increase the lifespan of these guys. On that note, the battery is not replaceable by the user either. Not a deal breaker but something to keep in mind if you are like me and like to be able to maintain your hardware as it ages.On the upside, I really enjoy the bigger screen the HP Chromebook 14 has to offer. So many Chromebooks have tiny screens, which is great on battery life but make it hard to use as your primary computer when you have a lot of tabs open and like to multitask like I do. I am also a huge fan of the keyboard. Again, Chromebooks tend to have rather cheap keyboards but the key presses on this model are crisp and typing is rather enjoyable. Typing isn't quite as enjoyable as it may be on my Macbook Pro or a mechanical keyboard but for the price of this unit, I don't expect it to be. I do enjoy typing on this notebook much more than I thought I would.Lastly, I really like the finish on the outer shell of the Chromebook. The white looks nice and the finish is a little bit grippy. It makes the notebook feel and look like a higher quality build than it most likely is. Obviously, this doesn't impact the utility of this computer but looks never hurt either.Also, while this doesn't apply to the &#34;snow white&#34; color scheme, if you are interested in the &#34;peach corral&#34; color, be warned it is very pinkish. Obnoxiously so. It looks much more red in pictures but when you see it in person, it is a hard color to look at. The blue-ish color scheme also doesn't look the same in person as it does in pictures. It is more of a turquoise and less of a green. Just thought I would mention this in case potential buyers are looking at the other colors. I bought a few of each color and the white is definitely the more polished and professional looking of the three colors available for this specific model.Like I said, my initial impression of this Chromebook is that it is a nice machine and it is probably the first Chromebook I could see as a viable replacement for a Windows or OS X based machine. Nice screen, nice keyboard, I just wish users could upgrade it themselves a little more."],["i like this computer, but i dont see it replacing my windows 7 machine. design, build quality, and price are nice. it does seem a tad heavy for its design but im a real man so its not a big deal to me. i like this chromebook 14, but i dont LOVE it.for me, i dont see it replacing my main windows machine because you can't install utorrent (to, um, download publicly shared science papers on global warming n stuff). and no vlc player. i love vlc! even windows media player, which is, well, mediocre at best, i still miss it. i miss having a separate program to play media files. chrome just plays stuff in a tab. i am not a fan. and what's up with no podcast chrome apps? to me, that's just not acceptable.the 2 most jarring things are probably the lack of caps lock key and there being no \"right click\" (the trackpad has just one big \"click\" button at its bottom). there are workaround solutions you can google for that generally get the job done. but they do take some getting used to.another thing is just getting used to the chrome OS, which is made to be fairly limiting. for the last 2 decades of my life ive just gone to control panel and eventually figured out whatever i was looking for. well on a brand new OS like chrome, its taken a lot of, well, googling, to figure out how to just do basic stuff. kind of a pain. but i dont whine about change, i just deal with it.ive thought about getting a chromebook for my mom, but like i said, it is limiting. case in point: 99.9% of the web is geared towards internet explorer, because it's the most popular browser on the planet. on my windows 7 machine, my favorite browser is firefox, but sometimes a web page doesnt quite look right or work right, and so i have to use ie to view it. well, it seems im having even more of those issues with the chrome browser- web pages that just dont quite work right. now, there is an \"ie view\" chrome extension which is fine, but i cant see my mom actually using that. she would just wonder why the page isnt working correctly. and for myself, going from having ie, firefox, and chrome all on the same machine, to having just chrome, it can kind of be a pain in the rear. ive found chrome to crash more often (which isnt all that often, really) than firefox or ie ever did. i got the \"aw snap!\" crash at least once a day. ie and firefox crash maybe once a week. is it because of the only 2 gb of memory? i have no idea. but with some websites just appearing funky in chrome and then on to the crashes (for me, chrome has always had an issue with flash), i am longing for the days of having 3 different browsers to play with. oh well.like i said, its a fine second computer. im literally going to use this sitting on my couch to surf and play things on my chromecast. and the battery life is excellent! i got like 8 hours on it last night. kudos to hp and google."],["The laptop is really geared for web browsing.It is of instant start, good spead and sound, together with lower price.The only downside is occasionally i find display is a little blurry and resolution can be higher"],["I cant say anything bad about it and i love it,i love it,i love it.only thing is that i had to purchase a different printer that would work on the chromebook.other than that it is super fast for me."],["I've been using this as my only computer for about a week.

They were able to login and do the homework exercises without incident, get them bookmarked and back to gameplay in short order.  Only once or twice did they go back to their dedicated gaming desktops to do something on Steam or somewhere else.Finally, as they were forced to bed to sleep they rated the Chromebook as their best gift and that it made for a great Christmas.  I highly recommend these to anyone as an alternative to a &#34;real&#34; laptop.That said, I'm not sure about the Google Plus environment.  We created accounts for each boy and for me, connected our Family Circle, but I find all the clutter of Hangouts and related Apps you need of iPad or other systems to be totally confusing and unintegrated.  I have yet to get a shot at much time on the Chromebooks, but if things work better there that gives me hope, but for cross-device families I think the experience is a challenge.Oh, my final purchase decision was the under-$300 pricing of this at the time.  Although it was out of stock, I felt I was early enough to get the orders fulfilled by Christmas and they were.  IN spite of my appreciation for this system, it's solid 5GHz Wi-Fi support and its excellent Chrome browsing experience, I think $300 is my current limit for a device with Chromebook limitations.  Yes, I agree with the advantages (light OS maintenance, decent system security, etc) but I still feel this need to have local apps for when the network isn't there.I'll try to update this review over the next three months as we get more experience with these but after one day they are a major hit.One note, the Coral Red color looks like the faded paint on a 1970's import car that was parked in the sun for 40 years.  It also shows where oily hands have touched the case.  The White is much cleaner looking, but both boys like their colors and won't give them up."]],"title":"HP Chromebook 14 (Ocean Turquoise)","total_reviews":395,"sentiment":0.6988989873,"label":"positive","best_review":["Love it"]},{"asin":"B00FGOTBQO","brand":"HP","imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41-f8rcl-3L._SX300_.jpg","rating":[6,3,6,29,104],"reviews":[["Okay Google...  You got me.  One of the reasons for the wireless network upgrade was for the new laptop I ordered.  It was finally time to retire the workhorse, or at least put it on light duty.  Those who know me or have seen the lab know everything except secure stuff is done on an older Dell Inspiron 1545 laptop which I got used... and I do mean everything.  CAD? yes. CFD? yep.  EDA? check.  No, it is not stock.  The RAM has been upgraded to the maximum both in terms of speed and capacity, the hard disk replaced with an SSD, and the OS is Kubuntu stripped down for speed.  Bottom line: if there is anything I could have done to make it faster than it is, I don't know it.  Like most hotrods, there have been a lot of parts replaced besides the upgrades.  The keyboard has been replaced at least once, the hard disk at least twice.Lately, I have been seeing some disturbing trends.  About one time in 20 it will not boot until powered off and restarted.  Sometimes the USB camera or other device doesn't even register.  The wireless quit working, and it isn't the card or driver.  Today the DVD-RW wouldn't recognize a blank disk.  This would seem to indicate motherboard issues.  Plus, I wore a hole in the glidepoint over the years. It is time.  Rather than fight with it, or pick up parts from Ebay and keep the old girl going, I ordered something new.  Not just brand new, but also a different type of laptop... a Chromebook.  It is an HP 14-q070nr, which is a full size unit with a 14&#34; screen and free T-mobile 4G for the life of the unit.  It came today, and while I was excited, I did not expect much from a Chromebook compared to my hotrod laptop.I was wrong.  In every respect of the things within the capabilities of a Chromebook, the HP is faster... a lot faster.  This probably has to do with the new Haswell architecture from Intel and Chrome OS being tweaked within an inch of it's life by the pros at Google.  Good job guys!The second surprise was when I linked my existing Google account with the device.  Within a minute, everything was synced (as you would expect with Chrome, only MUCH faster), and I was responding to an email within 5 minutes of turning the Chromebook on for the first time.The third surprise was what happened when I plugged it into the speakers, monitor, and wireless keyboard on my desk.  Again, everything just worked.  The monitor (an LG IPS224v) was instantly recognized, as was the keyboard and mouse (Logitech K350 Wave cordless set).  Other than my screen icons and wallpaper being different, it looks the same.  It all just works flawlessly.As far as the limitations of a Chromebook, I have been migrating most of what I do to Google Drive anyway in order to prepare for the inevitable complete failure of my old workhorse laptop.  There are a few programs I would like to be able to run which do not have a chrome equivalent, but I will figure out the work-arounds.  As of right now, I can't really think of much I need a laptop for that this thing can't do, other than the bits I really need an engineering workstation for.Rating: 9.5/10.  This would be perfect if not for the worse-than-usual chiclet keyboard and the Mac-style (single button) mouse.  Only a half point off because it recognized the external keyboard and mouse with all the extra functions of both.Total Install Time: about 10 minutes, including grabbing my old background image from Deviant Art.Result: I can do 98% of what I could do with my old workhorse (100% of what I should have been doing with it) for 20% of the power, an honest 6 hour run time (to be tested), and connectivity anywhere there is a WiFi network or in the T-Mobile 3G/4G coverage area.&#65279;"],["I was a little skeptical about Chromebooks considering the other professional reviews I had read and watched. I decided to buy this after analyzing what I really did on the laptop..... about 99% of the time my family uses the computer for media consumption, casual gaming, social media updates, and word processing. This Chromebook performs all of these tasks flawlessly.  The screen is not the best but not bad either (unless you are a perfectionist when it comes to your screen). The size is very good and there are tons of games most of which are free on the Chrome Web Store. I dont have to worry about updating antivirus/malware. I'm thinking I will be buying another one"],["It's exactly what I needed. 90% of my time on my PC was spent in Chrome anyway so having a Chromebook dedicated to everything I need is great. It is SUPER fast (I recommend the 4GB ram) and light. The screen looks great and I haven't experienced any lagging whatsoever. The only downside I've found so far is the speaker placement. They sound decent enough but when using it on my lap or soft surface (couch, pillow) the sound gets absorbed and is difficult to hear. Simple solution: headphones. Love the trackpad and keyboard - both are very responsive and easy to use. Love that the 4G was extended from 2 years to the life of the product. I don't need it very often but it's nice to have when I do.Bottom line: do your research and know what you're buying. A lot of the reviews I read of people that were disappointed made it clear that they were expecting a PC replacement or a lot more functionality. This device is basically made to be a glorified Chrome browser and then some, which is fine! It suits my needs perfectly. Highly recommend the HP 14in. model to avoid feeling cramped. It's the perfect size to bring anywhere."],["Purchased 05/06/14. Purchased with: iPearl mCover Hard Shell Case (clear), AmazonBasics 14.1\" Case, AmazonBasics 3-Button Wired Mouse.I absolutely LOVE my new HP Chromebook 14 w/T-Mobile!!! I was somewhat worried about going to a 14\" from a 15\" screen, but I can actually read the HP better, (Settings > Very Large; 100%, which I think helps). As a first time HP consumer, I'm very impressed, they have a winner here! I'm quickly becoming a HP convert, as a long time (15 yr) Dell user, that's a pretty strong statement by me.I really like the iPearl mCover Hard Shell Case because it will keep it nice and clean, maybe even protect it against some hard knocks. I wasn't sure if I'd like the mousepad, so I got the AmazonBasics wired mouse, (just in case). I use one of these with my Chromebox and it works great, no hiccups, burps and/or farts - at least from the mouse! After a couple days of use, the HP mousepad is just fine, (actually, it works great!), although I haven't figured out the left-click, (no switch option in the Mouse Settings that I could find), which is OK, don't really need it too much - and if I have to do a bunch of editing, (copying/pasting or dragging), while on the road, I'll just plug the mouse in, so no big deal.I received it quickly, (thank you Amazon Prime!), and it was well packaged. Thank you HP for not putting any stickers on the screen, I really do appreciate that (a lot)!I'm very familiar with the Chrome OS, I have had a Samsung Series 3 Chromebox since Nov 2012, (LOVE it!), and I'm definitely hooked into the Google ecosystem. I love the Docs and Spreadsheets, love the fast start time and ABSOLUTELY LOVE the NO maintenance!!!!! This also carries over to my new Chromebook. I completely agree with previous Amazon reviewers, \"This is the future of computing!\"I have only had the HP a few days and my first impressions are...are...are...a big fat solid 10 stars! It really has exceeded my expectations! The HP was SO easy to set up! I was online and working including the unboxing (2), reading Quick Start Up Guide, (1), Activation (1 for Google, 5 for T-Mobile = 6), so about 10 minutes total. Sure beats starting up a Windows machine!!!!The T-mobile signal is pretty weak where I live, so I was really surprised when I started the initial HP Chromebook setup, I apparently had access to it. So I thought, I'll go for it, let's see how it goes. It actually went great, Google OS updated quickly with no issues. The T-Mobile activation was VERY easy, I really took my time with it though - to get it right the first time. I've read a few reviews where some were having some problems activating the 4G service, they spent hours on the phone w/support. I don't get it, but maybe they had a unique problem or didn't follow the correct procedures, because, to me, it could not have been any easier. I'm really glad it has a 4G option, to me, it'll be much safer when I'm on the road at unsecured local, hotel or airport hot-spots. If I use the 4G time up, so what, I'll pay for a day pass, it's worth it to me for the security it provides.A previous reviewer complained about Chrome OS not having Java that was causing some issues for certain websites for him, (um, refrain from those porn sites dude!  &lt;g>). I have no such issues with any websites and I also access many shopping, banking and investment account websites, (and I don't go to porn sites! &lt;gg>). Now for one bank that I use, it does require Java for echeck deposits. I need to access my Dell to deposit/process these checks, (or go to my local bank at the nearby shopping center - ugh!). Not a big deal though, I only receive a (very) few checks a year - and eventually I'll be getting an Android device, (Nexus?), when the Dell dies (?), and I'll just use that banks Android app for echeck deposits, so again, no big deal.I find it strange that some people who buy this device, (any Chromebook/box for that matter), and then complain, \"Ew, it's not Windows?!\" or \"Ew, the OS is too confusing or complicated!\". Sure, if you've never used it, it can be a tad overwhelming at first, (not really - maybe, just maybe  *you* are the problem). But once you''e learned it, (within a day), it's so easy to master/navigate and it's not confusing at all. I like it because it's NOT Windows! I know I'll NEVER go back to a bloated, virus prone, update needy, too many repairs Windows machine again. The Chromebox and Chromebooks are top Amazon sellers and the momentum is growing. MS should be VERY worried.As of a few months ago, I'm now finally 100% cloud-centric. Switched from Quicken to Clearcheckbook.com, ($42 yr - Premium, but they do have a free basic version that you can use). We use it to manage our household cash for all of our accounts and I use (very) detailed Google Spreadsheets for the registers (for backup), CB, projected income, YQWD NAV bal/inc stats, (thanks Google!). It's so nice and easy to share and manage our household financials now. Quicken was great while we had it, but is now done and we couldn't be happier! Intuit is missing the cloud boat, Mint isn't going to cut it. Oops, I'm kinda of getting off track here, (sorry), but my point is, Google and Chromebook are the new reality for (cloud) computing and with a little time and effort to make a thin client PC work for you, I think it's definitely worth it.BTW, I added some extensions, (all free), from the Chrome Web Store that I think some people might be interested in: AdBlock Plus, (ABP, it's GREAT!), Chrome New Tab Redirect (use any URL you want for a new tab- via Options), Win7 Scroll Bars, and Webpage Screenshot. I also `Pinned to Shelf': Files, G-Mail, G-Drive, G-Calendar, Calculator, G+ Pictures, G Hangouts, Chrome Web Store and Chrome Remote Desktop. Of course, everyone's needs are different, but all of those I mentioned above helps me out a lot...fast and easy, making your Chromebook even better...The only (minor) cons I have are: I was going to say that it would have been nice for it have a backlit keyboard, but I think that's pretty unlikely considering the wonderful price point this HP currently has. At night, the white keys really do help to see the keys better. Backlit keys would be really a nice feature, but to me, not mandatory. But what would really be nice is that if it had a number pad. Oh well, what can you expect for a $329.99 computing device. I just won't crunch numbers when on the road, which is just fine by me...(yay!)It's a GREAT device and I highly recommend it!!!!  5/5Updated 07/15/14:  I'm extremely happy with my HP CB 14 4G, but while on a recent trip, a problem developed with the `e' key occasionally sticking which occurred with normal tying. I could unstick it by very gently prying the top edge of the key up by using my fingernail or by tapping the key very gently several times to release it from the keyboard body frame. But it definitely needed to be repaired.OK, this is going to be a real test of the product, (repair services). Am I going to rip HP a new one??? We'll see. Called HP support, and yes, of course it was outsourced to India. But nice surprise, I could actually understand them quite well, very good english pronunciation skills, (hell, I can't even sometimes understand a Southern or NE USA accent!). She understood my issue and explained exactly what the procedure was. Received the Fedex shipping box on a Tues, sent to HPSC on Wed, HPSC received it on Thu, it was repaired on Fri and sent to Fedex that evening and I received it back on Mon. Pretty amazing to me that it was that quick of a repair turnaround process. 5 stars!Sure it was a bummer that a product 2 months old already had a HW issue and needed to be sent in for repairs, (I have to admit it, I was VERY anxious!), but hey, a new Bentley has new car glitches! Stuff happens, no one is immune. I'm just glad that it was fixed with no charge and that it was a very quick process. Thank you HP! Even though it was gone for less than a week, I missed the little guy...BTW, while on this trip mentioned above, I didn't need to use the mouse that I bought at all, the mousepad performed like a champ. I also solved my \"no backlit keyboard\" issue for using it at night, I bought a Asus Google Nexus 7 (2013) LTE!!! LOL (absolutely love it!!!). It's a GREAT travel companion with the HP 14 4G, they complement each other so well!!! I'm definitely (still) a happy camper.-A"],["A great tool in every way, a good size and excellent durability of the battery.4G connection is great, works as HSPA + in Iceland"],["I am alternating between the Chromebook and a MacBook Air and find that I can leave the MacBook home most of the time.

My computer purchases always has been to buy with power to spare in case I need some serious computing power.  As I got older and wiser, I am toning down.  My son needed his first laptop for his homework and research as my old laptops became laggy.  I just got this Chromebook 14 and received it today.  I had time to set it up and test around a bit and must say that I am quire impressed.It's instant on and off feature makes this laptop very usable.  Touch pad works smoothly with the browser and since I'm already using chrome on my other computers, hardly any learning curve at all.  Google Drive can be instantly accessed from the bottom toolbar button.  For my son's use, word processing (school homework), research and web browsing, occasional netflix and lots of music listening (comes with bluetooth, wifi, and hdmi) it works seamlessly.  I went to a video streaming web site with proprietary player and streamed HD movie and played it on my TV via HDMI connection to AV receiver.  Both graphics and sounds were great.  For the price, I can have one for each one of the family.  I just promised my daughter I'd get one for her when she enters middle school.For most users who simply do web browsing mostly, and occasional movies, and word processing, this computer is perfectly balanced.  I'd recommend it for any household... especially one's with kids.  BTW, when I got the laptop today, it was partially charged to 80%.  I tinkered around with it to set up, test the video, and all that which took me a few hours.  Well, my son  had time to eat dinner and watch Ip Man 2 on netflix while I tinkered around.  The juice was still almost full.  So I'm leaning towards 9.5 hour battery life claim being understatement.  With 9.5 hours of battery life, I'd have to borrow this from my son when I go on business trip.  Free 4g would come in handy also.  Nice thing about the 4g is that the sim card was already installed and it worked right out of the box.  I didn't need to set up anything at all.  BTW, at the time of the writing, the Amazon price is higher than other places by quite a bit.  Walmart and HP itself sells this model for $350."],["Very happy with my purchase and I really could not beat this deal!

I bought the HP 14&#34; Chromebook when my 2008 15&#34; Macbook Pro finally started giving out.  I've been a Mac person for years, but I couldn't stomach dropping another $1000-$1500 for a new one. Figured I would try a Chromebook.  I savvy tech guy at work recommended I get 4GB and a Haswell-based chromebook (dunno what Haswell is) and the biggest display I could afford. After backing up all my files from my Macbook to a external drive (FAT format),  I made the jump.  The HP Chromebook is very very light, decent keyboard, really great speakers, decent overall ergonomics and good battery life.  The exterior is covered in a sorta thin rubber skin.. I like it and it seems to resist smudges and scratches well.  The screen resolution is not Apple retina quality... but this baby costs me under $300!!  The bottom line here is that the HP Chromebook is solid, looks nice and does exactly what it should: provides you access to da net. The 100GB of Google Drive space is great (first time using this...I really like it) and 2 year access to T-Mobile 4G is a huge plus, but have not tested that yet.  Simple access to the internet + decent amount of file storage = all I need.  Funny thing, after 3 weeks I have not once plugged in my external drive to access my old files....If you need to create stuff (art, apps, music) a Chromebook may not be for you.

It is faster than my old laptop and my ipad. Our internet speed is a shade above 30 and I think the chromebook could go a lot faster. The trackpad and keyboard are great.

It's not spectacular though. I like it but I will never love it."],["Let me start by saying I am very pleased with this laptop. I have been eyeing up Chromebooks for some time now, but haven't pulled the trigger. Finally I decided to wait for the next gen models aka this one with a haswell processor in it.Appearance:As for the appearance the white is very nice. It looks sleek and is very thin. Once open the interior does not disappoint either, The keyboard layout and track pad are both excellent in my opinion.Screen:The screen is actually pretty good quality and looks bright. It surely won't disappoint you, as it is an upgrade over my previous laptop.Performance:Now to the meat and potatoes that everyone truly questions. How does it perform?? Well the answer is simple, in one word incredible. It is excellent, the boot time is near instant. I chose this model because it has the 4GB of ram. I believe that is an important factor for my performance review. I have had no problem having multiple tabs open. I frequently have over 20 open at a time and experience no lag. I have multiple video tabs open and detail oriented pages and still run smoothly. I attribute that mostly to the 4GB of ram I believe which comfortably allows the resources to do such things.Overall appeal:This laptop has done nothing but impress me. It's light, fast, sleek and sexy. The track pad is big, feels good, and has lots of nice intuitive gestures which make using it simply a breeze.  There are some thoughtful design aspects that I do love. Simple things like the little power light on the side of the laptop. Along with the power light located by the plug which indicates when the laptop is fully charged. When opening the laptop from the closed state it will automatically turn on and within a couple seconds you are in chrome. The USB and HDMI ports are great additions and add connectivity. I also like having an SD card slot, so if you want extra local storage all you need to do is pop one in.Final Thoughts and Recommendations:If you are on the fence and have done the research, but are still apprehensive. Buy this laptop, do yourself the favor. You will not be disappointed. I recommend getting this model due to the 4GB of memory as I previously stated. The added 4G is a bonus on top of that. You can do so much on this laptop with all the google apps, stuff in the chrome store, and 3rd party sites. If you need office it's online now and you can use it free through skydrive anyway.

There is no RGB/comp port, and when the HDMI is hooked up, the tv just shows the computer's background image and not the tv show I am streaming.But there are plenty of other positives:1)  Printing works just fine; not sure why others have problems.2)  Setting up t-mobile was very easy; all of the set-up was very easy.  I think I had everything working in about 5 minutes.3)  My old Acer Chromebook did not have bluetooth; this one does, so that I can project the computer's sound to my bluetooth speaker.4)  I love the Chromebook system - how easy it is to use, how it prevents computer problems because you never download anything.5)  I especially love how you can write a google doc anywhere, even where you can't get a t-mobile connection, like on the metro, and then when you get to an internet connection, what you just wrote is automatically saved online.  I have this continual problem where I want to save all of my documents online, but then I write them somewhere I do not have an internet connection and later forget to change them from a Word document to a google doc.

Appearance is sleek and clean but more importantly, the functionality, mobility, speed, and power is beyond  what I expected in the Chromebook experience.

Barth"],["I'm not going to waste your time listing all the specs, you can look at them in the description. BUT what I will say is that this Chromebook has met and/or exceeded all expectations! Normally I'm a Windoze guy, but needed something for now until I can replace my last laptop that was stolen. Honestly, this Chromebook has made it so that I am not going to have to feel the need to replace it anytime too soon. If you are already wrapped up (or at least used to) and into the Google infrastructure (Google Docs (word processing), Drive (cloud storage), Chrome (browser) among many others) then you'll surely get the most use out of this Chromebook. But even if you're not, if you're simply looking for something thin and portable yet feature filled, very fast and even aesthetically pleasing, to use in between your utilization of (insert operating system of choice), then this will do you well. Plus it costs less than most laptops out there, that are such low specs they aren't really worth it (for a lot of people). I still haven't found (at least for me) anything this can't do, that I want it to do frequently, and it does everything I need for now very well. I don't really have anything bad or overly negative to say about it, but there are some things you should be aware of (if you are not up on what a Chromebook is...I advise you to research a bit just so you are an informed consumer).Any &#34;cons&#34; I have are listed below. But it's hard to consider them &#34;cons&#34; since I already knew what to expect as far as what this machine could or couldn't do, so for the sake of information here goes:1. Cannot rip or burn DVD's or CD's (but you can upload/play music files and upload data files all day on Google sites like Google Play Music or Google Drive among others).2. Cannot run external non-Google applications like Photoshop (there are Chrome Store apps for photo manipulation), CD/DVD driven games, MS Office (there are SO many web alternatives by Google (Docs) and others), etc.3. In some cases, you cannot do things on a Chromebook without an internet connection (but seriously, when won't you have a connection?) Plus this particular model comes with free 200mb worth of 4G data (TRULY FREE!) and you can upgrade that too if you so choose in order to have access in more locations.Otherwise, if you can live with all that, you have a good chance of being as ecstatically happy with this Chromebook as I am, and so many other people. Boot time in seconds, free upgrade on Google Drive to 100GB of storage, updates automatically any Google/Chrome apps or Chrome OS (minimum of restarting which doesn't take long anyway). The external sound is better than expected (read: louder), USB 3.0, HD web cam, SD card reader, 14in bright screen (not the best but FAR from the worst)...the list of amenities goes on and I can't say enough good things. I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised at least a little bit, and now that I've had this Chromebook for a week, I am truly impressed by HP and Google's little collaboration here."],["Great but $80 cheaper at walmart.com or frys.com.This is so much better than hassling with the ridiculous windows 8. Nice chrome has parental controls so you can whitelist only the appropriate websites for kids.Now if google would just make parental controls for gmail so kids could send/receive email from only approved contacts and see all emails kids would be safe."],["This is my third Chromebook. My first was the original Samsung that came with 2 years of free 3g from Verizon along with the built in wifi. I really loved that product, however after one year the screen went bad and turned mostly greenish. I replaced it with a cheap Acer that was wifi only. I missed the optional 3g from time to time, but the Acer was not a bad cheap laptop.It did it's job and I used it every day. Unfortunately I dropped it after having it about 18 months and the screen cracked.So this time I decided to upgrade to one of the higher end chromebooks and after reading reviews decided to get the HP  14.Let me first say that only chromebook users know the complete satisfaction of bringing home a new chromebook, opening the package, plugging it in and literally within 3 minutes your screen looks EXACTLY like your old computer did before it broke!  Absolutely hassle free!I love everything about the HP 14 so far.  14&#34; screen seems enormous compared to my previous Samsung and Acer models.  The build quality seems very good.  I have noticed significantly faster browsing speeds on the HP 14 compared to my old Acer.Icing on the cake is 100GB of Google Drive for two years at no cost, and FREE T-Mobile 4G for the life of the product. (200GB of data usage per month)  Incredible!I am fully on board with Chrome OS,  My desktop is an HP Chromebox, laptop is the HP 14, and my portable  is a Nexus Google tablet. Seamless functionality and syncing across the entire platform. No viruses, no spam, no spyware. I would never go back to Windows based computing."],["This is the first laptop I bought since my 2007 white Macbook. This laptop feels almost the same, only its actually lighter and thinner than my old macbook. I was a little skeptical about chromebooks but now I am completely convinced this is the future of mobile computing. I turned it on and was instantly greeted by a screen to enter my gmail account, at which point all of my settings from the cloud were instantly applied. By using cloud9, nodejitsu, and github I can use this machine to develope my webapps. Unless you need photoshop or wish to play intensive pc games this laptop is amazing. Because you don't need to pay for windows you get a better quality laptop for the same price."],["This is a tremendous piece of machinery. Solid. Beautiful. Fast. Nice large screen - much better than my Samsung Chromebook's 11\" screen. Works on WiFi. Works on 4G. I've had it for a few weeks now and it works flawlessly.Indeed, I have been able to ditch my PC loaded with Windoze and assorted Microsoft bloat and use this Chromebook as my sole computer! Everything I do now for both work and play is on the web: Google Docs, Google Spreadsheets, Google Calendar, Gmail, Multiple Listing Service, Transaction Desk, Pixlr Photo Editor, news, etc. And this beauty allows me to do it all! And print! Plus, many of these Chromebook apps are also available offline (Google Docs, Gmail, Pixlr Photo Editor, etc.), so I can work on them even without an Internet connection! And each day more apps become available for offline usage.Google is way ahead of the curve with these Chromebooks. It is the future of computing, as everything is going online - whether Bill Gates likes it or not!In point of fact, Microsoft is now so afraid of the Chromebook that it has hired the two old fat guys from the show \"Pawn Stars\" (who know diddly about computers) to trash the Chromebook in an ad! It's a pretty sorry ad.Even here on Amazon, you will notice, of late, the sudden appearance of a few negative reviews for the Chromebook 14, where before there were literally none.

CHROMEBOOK NONTOUCH IS STILL BEST VALUE FOR YOUR DOLLAR!First you all, it's easy to judge my POV as being disingenuous. Vast majority of Chromebooks users will no doubt view me this way but before writing me off, I'm just like you! Originally a googler user on a Netscape browsers since 1996! Google continues to push innovation year after year, Chromebooks are no exception. One of the goals they had with Chromebook was connecting the lower class to the Web.To do this they engineered a Browser like OS(chromeOS). Software with low resource requirements in keeping prices down. Customarily  to get online needed a $600laptop  but mid 2011 google changed that with Chromebook @ $200!before all that ,the tech companies tried this as well! The industry created a new category called \"netbooks\" laptops 2007. Cheap but slow, a deal breaker! WHY? because the technology wasn't there yet.  Thus, we the consumer market correlated the terms NETBOOKS CHEAP Laptops = unusable SLOW.  LOL  Chromebooks changed all that a few years ago. Finally a cheap but fast machine at a fraction of a price are now at the hands of the budget conscious buyers. Is it a full working laptop? Definitely not. But it's perfectly fine for people needing to browse the internets... at least for now.Then another \"cause and effect\" shift in innovation occurred in the industry.  \"Cause\" > MOBILE devices boom, \"EFFECT\" > Faster Tech evolution.INTEL & AMD's new SoC and APU chips. To the novice readers, those two companies are the brain power of the industry.  AND the latest shift in innovation occurred late (October) 2013, higher level of processing power paved way reengineered \"Netbooks\"* to match Chromebooks affordability but offering users usability a full functionality of Windows OS and not just a Browser backboned OS(ChromeOS). The Technology finally caught up.11-14\" Touch Laptops w/ advanced SoC/APU based notebooks from various OEM are bringing back \"NETBOOK\" category to life. These was what Asus EeePC shoud have been in 2008.  But unfortunately, our frustrating experience of NETBOOKS in years past is hard to forget, the damage has already been done.

We the early adopters are really just testers of a new technology. Having said that, I have no doubts this is the way of the future so I guess we may as well get on the train and start learning so we can appreciate new developments as they come.This month I was re-installing windows which seems to be a yearly ritual as it starts running slow and gets glitchy after a while. I think I have had to re-install windows every year or more on every windows machine I have owned.While doing my yearly re-install I was pondering how much I loved my android phone; it just works. I was wishing they made an android computer. So I went to my trusty Amazon site and searched android PC; not expecting much. Well Chromebooks popped up and I had looked at them a year or so ago and read a bit but at that time they were all pretty small tablet devices. When I saw they were making a 14 inch laptop that actually had connectivity and some usb ports etc I caved and ordered one.I am so glad I did I love my Chromebook and certainly see the many benefits as well as some early adopter drawbacks.Pros:*No windows system which means no bloat, no updates, no viruses, no virus protector, no malware protectors, no endless settings, no endless services, and not 1001 things that can go wrong on any given day on a very complex and large operating system sitting on your own computer.*I loved Rhapsody at first blush and have used it for many years since the beginning. What I loved about Rhapsody Is having all my music in the cloud. With Chromebook the concept of cloud is extended to pretty much all of my computing. I don't have to worry about lost documents or my windows computer crashing and taking everything with it.*No endless high priced programs to buy. I loved MS Office I think it is a fine product but each rendition becomes in typical MS fashion more complex and hard to use. Google office is still pretty easy and straight forward. It does take a bit of learning to become comfortable with cloud docs.*Fast. My Chromebook is fast. I typically open about 60 web pages each morning. I think my Chromebook actually does this better than my 8 core AMD processor. I say that because it is just as fast, maybe faster. But the big difference is the fans and system does not start moaning groaning. Chromebook just opens up like a dog being fed a piece of sirloin.*Bluetooth works great and my wireless keyboard and mouse work fine with Chromebook.*Connecting to a bigger screen was not a problem. I was a bit worried I would not like the 14 inch screen after using a 24 inch screen. Really I do not miss it but if I do, it does connect and I can use my big screen without missing a beat. Also by connecting to a bigger screen I can much better HD screen.*Settings. I love the simple settings (listen up Google and MS). I was sick of the MS system of endless settings and services. When I opened up MS controls there were endless icons each with endless settings. MS and Google would both be well advised to read the book The Paradox of Choice. Endless choices are paralyzing and add little to user enjoyment.  At this point Chromebook has a few simple and easy to understand essential settings.Cons:I got what I expected almost.*The screen is not that brilliant compared to a good HD screen. It is totally serviceable and had I had to pay another 50 bucks for a brilliant screen I may not be typing a review for a Chromebook so I am fine with the screen.*Not much HD memory but I can attach a large USB thumb drive if I really need more. Most of my music and photos are on a terabyte drive so I doubt that I will really miss the memory much as I get accustomed to not using it.*I think the biggest surprise and con (listen up Google) is it cannot connect to my wireless printer which is less than two years old. In order to connect to a printer that is not a newer printer that is Google cloud capable a person needs a windows machine or an apple machine to connect the Chromebook to a wireless printer. I thought the idea of a Chromebook was to get away from windows. Common google my printer is wireless. Is it really that hard to figure out how to connect to it without a new printer or a windows machine. I find that totally irritating. I guess I will do all my printing off of my windows machine until my printer craps out.*I do day trading and Chromebook will not run the web based programs because the programs require Oracle services. I kinda figured my Chromebook would not run them  as I knew I could not do a Oracle download to Chromebook. Listen up Google. I would really like to see you partner with OandA and figure out how to run financial programs without Oracle or figure out how to incorporate Oracle in your cloud-base OS.Well that is a quick rundown and my initial impressions after using the Chromebook for a few days. I love being able to go to my easy chair and surf the web. I just wish I could get totally away from windows but the Chromebook or more pointedly, the Chrome OS needs to go through a few more generations before it will be the only computer OS I need.Update March 2014. I still love my Chromebook but the thing I really miss is a lighted keyboard. I have not used a laptop regularly for years until I got my chromebook. Now I am on it all the time in my easy chair. I find myself taking my hands off the keyboard to mouse then never get them indexed right in the dark. Knowing how much I use this little guy and how often I am in the dark while using it I would have gladly paid significantly more for a lit keyboard."],["It appears Amazon has just started selling these this week.  I bought mine a couple of weeks ago when it appears that a big box retailer with the initials WM that rhymes with CART seemed to have the exclusive.  I am typing this on my Chromebook 14 (snow white color) using the free T-mobile 3G internet connection as I'm nowhere near a WIFI spot.  This is a great laptop for checking email, Facebook, listening to Pandora, and of course browsing the web.  If you are looking for a computer to do spreadsheets and video production, this is NOT your computer, but if you want something to sit on the kitchen counter and quickly surf the web, this is a good candidate.  Also a great idea for your parents or those who don't really want to spend ANY time updating or maintaining their computer.  You just turn this thing on and 5 seconds later it's on and working.  It updates itself and you don't have to worry about viruses etc since it's the Chrome operating system.  Here are my pro's and con's:Pro's:- Nice keyboard.  Some have criticized it but I find it has a nice \"spring\" to it and has comfortable spacing.- Battery life:  I charge mine every 2-3 days... my battery seems to last forever, but it's only 8 hours.  That's a lot longer than any other laptop I've owned.- Included GO GO internet (12 sessions) means you can surf the web for free when you fly an airline (like American) that features GOGO service.  Note this is 12 flights, not 12 all-day passes, so if you have two flights in one day you use 2 of your credits.  Extremely easy to use by the way, you just open the Chromebook on the plane and it guides you through the process.- 100 GB Google cloud drive storage, for storing documents photos etc in the Google cloud.  I haven't used this much since I use my other computers for word processing etc.- Google Apps:  Yes, you can use their free version of \"Office\" to build spreadsheets and word processing documents.  It's all cloud based and online.- SUPER FAST- I should have put this as the #1 pro...but literally it \"boots up\" in about 3 seconds... it has a solid state drive (no moving parts) and 4 GB of memory (unlike the non T-mobile version which just has 2 GB of memory) which makes this processor fly.  I have 11 tabs open right now.- Google connected: Once you input your gmail password, it syncs to your desktop and copies over the bookmarks etc.- EASY.  It's like an iPhone.  It just works.  There's no troubleshooting or figuring things out.  The out of the box experience is great - you just turn it on and you're on.Con's:-  THE SCREEN.  This is a big one but not a show stopper for me.  The Chromebook 11 has a GORGEOUS IPS screen with a 176 degree viewing angle.  I think originally this one was supposed to as well because some of the marketing materials indicate the 14 has an IPS screen.  It does not.  The viewing angle is pretty terrible if you're sitting to the side. You have to look at it dead on.  As I'm typing this I tilted to the left and at about the 10 o'clock position of my head you start to not be able to see the screen.  I called HP today and validated with them that the 14 does NOT have the IPS screen.  Having said that, this screen is fine for email web etc but if you are hoping to use it to watch Netflix with friends, forget it, you'd have to sit on each other's laps.  Depending on your friends that might not be such a good idea.- The weight.  I know, it's a cheap laptop, and it has lots of pro's, but it's about half pound heavier than I'd like it to be.  When I put it in my bag I really feel it.  It's not like one of those $1500 apple laptops (though it looks a little like one...) that's razor thin and air light.  But HELLO this is a fraction of the cost.- No keyboard backlight.  Not an issue for me but some might not like that you have to have the lights on to see  the keyboard at night.Chromebooks aren't for everyone, but if you're looking for an easy way to get on the web, this is a great option for you.  I really like mine a lot, despite the aforementioned display weakness.  I imagine they were trying to save $$ and hit a price-point when they chose not to put an IPS display in the 14... that's too bad.  But I still love my Chromebook.Hope this helps.Hope this helps!"],["Excellent low cost computer.

Very sleek and the battery lasts a very long time.The only other downfall is that the microphone picks up a lot of background noise and there are no apps to screen record on the chromebook in case you want to create a presentation or course online. Still needs improvement in those two areas for people who want to use a chromebook for business presentation.Other than that,  highly recommended for the non-business user as cloud based computing is the way of the future."],["I came over from a PC and after many frustrating year with Windows I am happy that I made the decision to purchase this Chromebook.

I already live in the Google/Android ecosystem and I'm so glad I can finally start moving completely away from Microsoft and windows nightmare.  After updating to windows 8 and 8.1 I was completely fed up.  The update crashed my laptop and it was unrecoverable.  My desktop has been my stop gap while I figured out finances.  I had been following chromebook since the beta hardware but was never interested because of the stupid tiny screens.  14 is my minimum.  while I still would have preferred a 15.5 I'm completely happy with the 14 inch.  I'm slowly migrating everything to Drive and googles cloud and cant wait until I no longer need to turn on this windows POS anymore.  Also I might ad that at 1/3 of the price of a similarly designed laptop (aesthetically is what I'm referring to not necessarily specs) it's an absolute steal.  In my opinion the look and build is comparable to HP's Envy series or macbook pro."],["Fast and convenient. Big drawback is you cannot plug in your manual printer and have it work. You have to program another computer that already works with your printer and the chrome book will send the print to that one. Instructions are in your chrome book and are easy to follow.

That said, the only word to describe this is WOW. I'm a 56 year old granny and this computer is everything I need with plenty left over. It's fast and it has a good feel to it. I've already send all my files over to my free (at lease for 2 years) Google Drive, which went very smoothly.  I've had no trouble with apps or crashes. Netflix, YouTube and Amazon prime video's play very well. The colors that this Chromebook comes in are a nice bonus (no more black thank you). It seems the Snow white one is most popular followed by the Coral Peach with the Ocean Turquoise coming in last. I wanted the Coral Peach which was sold out so I ended with the Ocean Turquoise being the last one anywhere to be had. The picture on the box looks green, but to my nice surprise turned out to be a very nice sky blue. The T-Moble  4G would be nice if I lived in a area that could pick it up but alas I don't but it wasn't a selling point for me anyway. The selling points being, I have the first HP Chromebook and found how nice life could be without constant updates and which anti virus is going to save me today.

In 5 years I think Windows will probably be obsolete. After using a Chromebook you will never want to use a Windows  machine or a tablet ever. It's actually fun to use a computer again. Real web pages on a 14 inch screen. Not watered down mobile versions with NO FLASH! The screen is great and the touch-pad is perfect. Touch screen machines are so over rated. The HP's touch-pad is so much faster. Everything is already online and Google is the future of everything.

I'm already using the desktop less, and the Note II as just a phone.Well constructed, fast to boot, and snappy performance.  I may leave the tablet and notebook at home for vacations from now on.

IF I did NOT have the above issues I would give a 5 star"],["I would, as a starter, agree with one of a previous review that this is probably your best choice looking for a second laptop. The overall build of this model is solid, nice color and response time, which even came in a whole package of T-mobile data of 200MB/month for life. (Yes, it's an on-going promotion, I checked with the hp guys on the phone.) It runs swiftly with most of the projects that you'd probably want a &#34;normal&#34; laptop to be able to run and seldom chokes on any function, living up to the claim that had been quite popular ever since the manifestation of chromebook: It's as fast as your network.So, if you're any like me, you'd probably want to understand what's not so good about this particular model at this point, about which I shall be very honest with you:1 Dirt. Despite being a terribly appealing model and my color of dream of a laptop ever since high school, this Chromebook 14 Snow White does cause a serious trouble for neat freaks. One might face the challenge of constantly trying to clean up slight dusts on the outer shell and the glass-like screen. This process, despite not being extremely cumbersome, does pose as a disadvantage of those owning it.2. Screen. It doesn't have the best screen available. In fact, if I am to be completely honest with you, it's not even as good as my 2008 Macbook unibody, which is already entering it's 6th year of service. However, it does appear to be holding up to its job quite well, since the color rendering (being attacked by some reviews that I've seen as 'washed out') is no where terrible as one'd imagine from all online results. I would suggest that if you really are very worried about the screen resolution and color rendering ability, go into an actula store and have a look at it. I would say for most people, this screen should serve them as good as any mainstream laptops from my experience of visiting bestbuy two weeks ago.3. Weight. It's definitely heavier than MBPs, even the 15-inch one. But as I'm comparing this to my previous 13-inch Macbook, I really doesn't raise the red flag for me as a laptop that doesn't fit the job of being carried around. So again, if weight could be an issue for you4. Size. Fits nicely into classic Kanken, but anything that is any smaller could be a huge issue.5. Battery. Never got the advertised 9.5 hours. Maybe 6.5 if constantly watching video and 7.5-8 for browsing and handling documents.6. Stickers. Hate them, one was extremely hard to get rid of.Overall a satisfying buy. DO NOT consider this a viable option if you don't have a workstation available for heavy-task handling since the web app for windows/mac does lack certain important function and doesn't take any extensions. If it's any other case, feel free to give this model a try, especially when you're already a satisfying costumer with T-mobile data access."],["I will start off by saying that I did not buy it through Amazon because when I got it Walmart still had an exclusive on it, however I love everything about this laptop. Be aware that it does run ChromeOS. I like ChromeOS for how it just works, but it is very reliant on the cloud and as such it might not be for everyone. If you need more info on ChromeOS just look up one of the many reviews around the web.Pros:-It's plain fast. It boots in less then 5 seconds and is ready to go right away. It's like night and day from my old windows laptop that I had to turn on about ten minutes before I actually wanted to do anything on it.-Did I mention it's fast? I have about twenty tabs open right now while also streaming a music video in the background, and it doesn't have a single hiccup.-The keyboard is great. Typing just feels so natural on this keyboard with just the right amount of clickiness and texture. Also, since it is a 14 inch screen the keyboard is big and spread out, so I never worry about hitting the wrong key.-The battery life is awesome. I am a student and have been spending close to 12 hours at or around school these days (finals are coming up). I don't ever worry about bringing my charger. It usually last me about 9-10 hours on a single charge, so it can make it through an entire day easily.-The price is awesome. There is no need to buy additional software and for it's price tag I would have a really hard time finding a nicer laptop.-It looks very sleek. It's made out of plastic, but it doesn't look cheap by any means. Around the keyboard it has an aluminum look, while everywhere else it is a matte white material. The other colors are too flashy for me, but I think the white one looks really nice.-It has all the ports I need. Three USB ports, a full sized HDMI port and an SD card slot. I have used an HDMI cable to stream ESPN and Netflix on a TV while doing homework on my laptop and it handles it just fine.-It technically has fans and vents for cooling, but I have yet to hear them actually turn on. Even while streaming video, I couldn't hear any fan noises (unlike my old laptop that sounded like it was a plane taking off).-T-mobile data (200 MB) is free for two years and really easy to set up. No, it's not a tremendous amount of data, but it's nice to have in a pinch.Neutral:-The speakers are about middle of the road for a laptop. They are loud enough and will work in a pinch, but I always have headphones or speakers, so its a non-issue for me.-The trackpad works. Nothing much more to say about it. It is responsive and pretty big, but I have seen nicer ones (for a lot more money).-It has 16 GB of on-board storage. Now, everything that I do on this laptop is saved in the cloud (Google gives you 100 GB free through Drive) so I have had no issues with storage yet. And if I ever want a couple movies to watch over a long trip I can just buy a 16-32 GB SD card for like $20.-14 inch size. This just comes down to what you are looking for. I wanted a nice 14 inch laptop and this is perfect for me. However, the other chromebooks come in at a nice 11 inch size, so those might be better for traveling. And closely related to this....Negative:-The weight. Now it comes in at a solid 4 pounds, which is much lighter than my previous laptop. For me the weight is acceptable, however I wouldn't complain if it was another half pound lighter.-The screen. It has an acceptable screen. It isn't the prettiest screen I have ever seen, but it works fine for general use. Don't expect it to compare with a MB Pro Retina or a Pixel or pretty much any of the high-end tablet screens. But, like I said, it is completely usable for general use and the occasional video. And with the HDMI out, I just hook it up to my TV for any serious video watching."],["Bought this laptop strictly for my online college classes and it's couldn't be more perfect. I love that it is instantly on when I turn on the power, no waiting for anything to boot. Google's apps are amazing. I'm never afraid of losing my precious work because it saves it constantly as I type. Had I known about this about a year ago I would have never purchased my iPad mini.

The 4G T-mobile connection is not consistent in my home, but I did move a chair closer to a window and get better reception there.  However, I then ran out of \"free\" 4G time in about 10 days, with what I felt was a conservative usage over that 10 days.  I have had no issues with the laptop itself, it powers up very fast.

I upgraded to this one over a first generation Acer which I loved but was underpowered for video and keeping up with current web requirements.  I was looking for something faster with more RAM.I used my first chromebook pretty much all the time and only powered up the PC for video editing or software development where I needed the tools.  It is so good I haven't been able to justify a tablet yet.So here's some things I love about this one:- The FREE 4G for life is quite handy when you are away from WIFI.  THe 200MB per month has been enough so far except one month when my wifi disconnected and I streamed on it a while.  (Protip: disable the 4g modem until you want to use it so this doesn't happen).- The 14&#34; screen is quite nice although the screen itself is quite shiny and is exceptional at showing the dust.  It is quite bright and good viewing angles.- FAST (for a chromebook).  I forget the Google Diesel ratings but the Acer was rated slightly lower than my Note 2 phone (I think about 3000 ish).  This one is over 10,000 and you can feel it too.  VIdeo is smooth and it can display 16 megapixel jpegs from my camera quickly where the old one was unusable about 5-10 seconds(!!).- NIce feel.  It feels strong and solid and the external surface has kind of a rubbery feel that I like.- Extended desktop!  If you use an external HDMI  monitor you clonoe or extend the desktop which I find quite handy to get some real work done with this.- HUGE battery life.  Rated 8-10 hours I think?  At least twice what my old one was.  Leave the charger at home, you won't need it.-  Uses phone style headphone and microphone jack instead of the old PC style dual speaker and mic jacks.- Better Bluetooth.  Maybe this is just Chromeos improvements but the old one was a bit flakey with my bt mouse and didn't support audio.  The HP works fine with my way old ebay bt mouse.The Not-So-Good- Built in battery.  I didn't realize this until later but I realized that A) The long battery life I don't need a spare and B) I never bought a spare battery for my old chroomebook in the 2 years I owned it.  Something to think about but probably fine.  And the simplicity of the case not having to remove the battery is a plus.- The &#34;chiclet&#34; keyboard.  I didn't like when I saw it but went ahead anyway.  They call it &#34;island keys&#34; or something and after my initial distaste it is a non issue.  If I had a choice I might like more travel in the keys but it is a non issue now.  One more note: some HP14s apparently had an option for a lighted keyboard.  That would be awesome and I am looking to see if it can be added with spare parts to this model.  No luck yet.- The white color.  I don't like the white but this model didn't have a choice.  White shows all the smudges.  Other HP14s have some interesting color schemes.  I will probably buy one or more of the &#34;skins&#34; you can get 3rd party when it gets too  dirty.- It has a fan.  It is a very very quiet but now that we finally got rid of spinning disks for magic data crystals (flash drive) can we get rid of all mechanical parts?  I know that some chromebooks no longer have fans but they aren't quite there yet with &#34;high end&#34; chromebooks.Slightly off topic PRO-tip: Unless you have a new printer that supports Google Cloud print the ability to print was a shortcoming of chromebooks.  You can print to PDF and take a memory stick to the printer but my printer only seems to read about half of them.  Recently I purchased a Synology Diskstation for long term file storage at home and it supports Google Cloud printing and my Canon wireless all-in-one printer.  FInally I can print directly and wirelessly (and from anywhere, I think) to my printer."],["This is a great little computer.  I got it for my office assistant so she could work remotely.  I set up SSH and VNC to the office server and this little computer does a great job of logging in and displaying a remote session over the SSH tunnel.  It also works great with RDP.  In addition to that, she can use the chromeos for personal things and I don't have to worry about the computer bringing viruses or other malware onto the office network.  The security model of chromeos is perfect for this application.The system is fast and has really good battery life.  The only downside is the 1366x768 screen resolution.  I would happily have paid an extra hundred dollars to get a 1080p resolution but that is not currently available on any inexpensive Intel based Chromebooks."],["I am very satisfied with this purchase and I recommend anyone sitting on the fence to stop worrying and get one. Here are specific points:* Great battery life. You can easily exceed 8 hours, pretty good for such a large screen. If you are really trying to stretch the battery it is really easy to lower the monitor brightness right on the keyboard. Another bonus is that there is little or no bleed; when you turn it off it does not consume power (unlike my VAIO). Charge time is fast, approx 2 hours.* Screen is good but not great. If you are using this for gmail and web browsing you will be very happy. If you are massively into movies then you might be dissatisfied. Remember 14 inches is quite large and feels like a luxury when you are on the road. Webpages pop.* Remote Desktop Connection - This chrome feature worked exactly like RDC on my chrome desktop browser. I need to access a server for work and I was worried there would  be glitches but it was no problem.* User accounts: you can add user accounts for family members or set up a generic one for guests. I love this feature. My kids who have macs keep borrowing it!* Slightly on the heavy side. For me it is a trade off for screen size and I am happy.* T-mobile account worked well. Great for layovers at the airport. If you exceed the free usage you can buy accounts based upon volume. They are reasonably priced in my mind. I hate the paid services at the airport or even clicking through on the free ones. You can turn this feature on and off so you don't accidentally use it.* Fingerprints: my white unit does attract fingerprints but it wipes up easily. I would have gotten black if given the option as this is quite flashy in its own ultrawhite way.* Build quality is great!* Mouse pad: While the pad works generally well I had trouble highlighting so I bought the Logitech m305 Wireless Mouse which had no trouble being recognized upon startup and works great. Recommended add on.* I was very happy with the price. By the time you spec out a PC with Haswell i7, solid state drive and AC wireless you are in the big bucks. This book at this price got me off the fence without worrying about obsolescence."],["As someone who has re-imaged hundreds of Windows computers with their operating systems, I can tell you the Chromebook will give you some peace of mind. You'll never rebuild this computer because it runs Google's Chrome OS. You don't worry about malware and viruses because Google's OS has the protection built in. Google takes care of all the computer administration with the OS and browser, so you don't have to like you would in Windows, Mac, or in Linux, which are all operating systems I've used at one point.Over the past seven years I evolved into working in the Cloud everyday. The Chromebook works for me because I can focus on what I want to work on every day and not waste my time with intermittent IT admin type tasks that arise unexpectedly like defragmenting a disk, fixing a corrupted Windows registry hive, or fixing file permissions on my computer due to some obscure issue. I don't waste time backing up my data with an external HD or in Carbonite because the data is saved in the Cloud. With that said, you should turn on 2 Step Authentication with Google for extra security and to practice good security habits.I love these things about my Chromebook:1. Super fast boot-up time! I love getting to work RIGHT away.2. The Chrome taskbar at the bottom looks like the Windows 7 taskbar, which I customized for my key applications that I use everyday.3. Apps - Kindle Cloud Reader, Google Keep, Drive, Calendar, Google Music, Youtube, Gmail, TechSmith SnagIt.4. Battery life of up to 8.5 hours.5. No more rebuilding the computer, backing up data, fixing crazy windows OS or software issues, fixing file system corruption issues equals less stress and time spent and more time spent doing the things I love on the Chromebook. I have WAY more peace of mind. ( I recently rebuilt my Office Windows 7 Pro computer, backed it up, took an image of the build, and this took about 6 hours total).7. Price. $349 for this is a reasonable deal. I'm happy I didn't go with a Windows 8 ultrabook and spent at least double what I paid for this Chromebook. I have also experienced people losing their laptops, dropping their laptops, or having their laptops stolen while staying at hotels, so if one of these unfortunate things happen to you, at least you know you only lost $349 vs $500-$1000 with a typical Windows laptop!This is the first laptop I've bought in five years, and the Chromebook has convinced me that it's a game changer for my daily work flows.  I highly recommend this Chromebook. Google's mobile computing vision is very progressive and forward thinking, which works perfect for me."],["I'm impressed with Chrome OS, I love the minimal simple design of the computer as well as how fast it operates because there's no bloatware like you would find on a Windows PC. I love using this for school because I'm literally always connected to Wi-Fi so I don't have a problem running the PC. I wish the screen resolution were a bit better, but $350 for a PC I can't really complain. The PC never gets warm, probably because you can't download anything on int, but still its a plus. If I could sum up this product, I'd say that the Chrome OS computers are more like a tablet/phone with a monitor. You can download apps such as Spotify, or games from the Play Store. The keyboard feels nice in hand, its almost like a smooth sandpaper or hard plastic, can't compare it to anything but definitely feels better than soft touch plastic keys that show fingerprints. The PC powers on quickly and I'm automatically signed in and ready to go when I open the monitor (unless you power down the PC then you have to re-sign to yoru google account.On a scale of 1-10 as far as features go:Aesthetic appeal: 8.5Weight/feel: 9Keyboard: 7Screen Resolution: 9Speed: 9Functionality: 7I gave this product 4 stars because I don't like the key layout, I don't know if it is because it is 14 inches, but I feel as if the keyboard too small and I would of liked to see more key options for the top row of the keyboard (where normally the F1-12 keys would be) I don't ever use the back/forward/refresh button at the top of the keyboard because of how great the SwipePad/TouchPad works. I'd rather see play/pause/rewind etc keys at the top for movies/music since that's all you can really do as far as entertainment. Lastly, I wish this had a backlit keyboard, I know it's a cheap computer and you can't expect much to come from it, but I feel as if this should be the norm for computers these days, since my Windows PC has it, I definitely miss it."],["I'm going to return this item."],["Love it, have had it for 4 months and use it everyday.  Some files couldn't transfer but I make do with a second computer.

It's fast, it worked immediately, it's light. There was nothing to install. It starts up instantly.My Toshiba Satellite laptop came back from repair (crashed hard drive after only 4 months) and I didn't miss it at all. I use it only when I absolutely have to create a Word document.The Chromebook has it all -- Google Docs, Gmail, cloud storage on Google Drive, fast Chrome browser. It's the wave of the future and I highly recommend it."],["To preface, I have been a very long time user of Windows, in fact I was using Windows before it was Windows (DOS and Word 1.0) and still own the very first Microsoft mouse (very ugly and cheesy).  I used to own a PC repair business.  I am the family PC fixer.  Hopefully you understand I have been around the proverbial Windows block. :-)  That just changed a few weeks ago...I was extremely skeptical purchasing a non-Windows PC and I can honestly say this Chromebook has far and beyond impressed me.The fit and finish of this white HP Chromebook 14 is seriously reminiscent of an Apple product. The operating system used, Chrome OS, is extremely fast and boot up time is 10 seconds (just clocked it).My biggest concern was accessing Microsoft Office Word, Excel and Powerpoint.  With Google Sheets, Docs and Slides that problem was remedied. AND THEY ARE FREE!  The Chrome Remote Desktop also allows me to access Windows machines on my network and set up time was less than 15 minutes.The reasons I went with this model of Chromebook compared to others is:1. It has the T-Mobile mobile connection available and gives me 200mb a month FREE FOR LIFE of the device.  Now 200mb is not a lot but I have found it is enough for the very infrequent times I do not have WiFi access.  When you reach the 200mb limit, T-mobile will text your Chromebook and you can buy 1 gig for $20 (and there are other options).  Remember you only need the T-mobile connection when you DO NOT have WiFi access.  By the way setting up the T-mobile connection took less than 5 minutes and you DO NOT need a T-mobile account.  First time setup - Once connected to the T-Mobile network (should say 3G or H+ next to the time, if it doesn't click the WiFi or no network access icon next to the clock and connect to T-Mobile), open a webpage and try to go to any website, it will redirect to T-mobile and walk you through the setup.  Once you have done the one time setup next time will be a breeze, connect to the T-mobile network and go.  Note: I recommend you uncheck the box &#34;Automatically connect to this network&#34; for the T-mobile connection, this will make sure you connect to the T-mobile access when you want to (thwarts accidentally shutting WiFi off and the Chromebook automatically connecting to T-mobile and uses up your data for no reason).2. This model has 4 Gig of RAM, now some people claim the 2 gig RAM model is just fine.  BUT if you open several web pages the extra RAM will come in handy. And it is only a few bucks more than the 2 gig model.  Worth the cost believe me.3. It is $20 cheaper than the same model at Walmart (at the time of this post)Prerequisites:If you are someone who finds yourself using websites for 99% of what you do on a PC, then Chromebook is your ticket.If you find yourself needing Office applications and the rest of the time you use websites, then Chromebook is your ticket.If you find yourself needing some other application which runs on Windows, I would seriously investigate other application options, sometimes the application provider has a Chrome extension which you would use on your Chromebook.ALSO, there are many &#34;offline&#34; versions of Chrome OS applications so don't automatically believe someone who tells you if you use a Chromebook YOU HAVE to have a internet connection, in many many cases it is not true.If you get a chance Google &#8220;Chromium Project Security&#8221; and read the webpage.  Chrome OS is several times more secure than any Windows machine (or Apple, yes I said it!).  Chrome OS was built with security as it's cornerstone.  If anything this alone is a very good reason to use a Chromebook in today's technology age.  FYI you don&#8217;t need virus software with a Chromebook in fact it does not exist.  There is a reason for that (reread paragraph).One last thing, this Chromebook is QUIET, and runs EXTREMELY cool.  None of my Windows notebooks or ultrabooks are this quiet and cool (by a long-shot!).fyi: this post was written in Google Docs then copied pasted into the Amazon form.  Did I mention Docs is free?!Well I have babbled enough.  Now throw a Chromebook in your basket and start enjoying this completely awesome technology!!"],["Other reviews really helped me make a decision to purchase this. This originally was going to be a supplemental computer to use but it may just replace my other laptop. I only use this for communicating, shopping and professional tasks (research, papers, emails, presentations, etc.) I've been a loyal Windows customer for a long time (by choice) and decided to jump ship but not to Apple. My other laptop still works fine and I continue to use it. However, I'm currently completing a program that has me connecting with others on a continuous basis, and requires me to write, share, and post lengthy replies to emails, etc. I decided to try a more mobile and integrated approach and have to say this is a change, but it is working out well.I didn't really want to be so in bed with Google, but I'm over that. My Nexus 5 syncs to this machine, which has proven handy. Google apps for this machine have been very easy to use, such as online Microsoft Office products like Word, Excel, and Powerpoint which are free and are easily saved to Google docs, or to the machine.This computer starts up lightening fast, seems to produce very little heat, and has extra long battery life. I have charged it twice in the week that I've owned it.I haven't had to use the T-Mobile 200mb/month service yet. I think that will get you through a least 2 Youtube videos, but its nice to know you can hop on and send an email, or upload a document if you need to, or even look at a map if you're lost.My advice, if you're going to buy one here is, go to Costco, or Bestbuy, see the machine and feel it up first and make sure you like the aesthetics.  Learn some basis keyboard short cut keys because like Apple this doesn't have a right click."],["I am giving the Chrome book 1 star.  I purchased the Chromebooks because i needed a back-up to my 10yo Dell desk top.  I have no complaints about my dell as i have had it for more than 10yrs and have gotten more than my money's worth out of it.  It went on the fritz last weekend so i decided that i needed a back-up PC.  Just something that would allow me internet access to check my email and such.  The Chromebook fits that need since it has limited functions since it operates different than a normal PC....ie...you are unable to print or read word documents.  What really made me purchase this HP model is it came with free T-moble.  That is the reason i am rating it 1 star.  it indicates that you get free T-mobile for life.  that is all just a racket between HP & T-moble cause you only get 200MB for 30 days.  I received this on 6/18/14, and I was on the internet for about 1hr,watched 1 video wich was about 8mins long and then i got a msg from T-moble advising I had used up my 200MB and would need to purchase more data.  I will make a one time purchase but I will shop around for a unlimited 3G or 4G data plan.....I will not make any more purchases from T-moble just as a matter of principle for trying to rip people off!!!...To tell the truth i did not realize that this model did not come with an ethernet port or i would not have made the purchase.  Once you order the item from amazon and open the box you are unable to return it.Update 6/26/14I returned this chromebook for a full refund and thankfully Amazon honored my return ang refunded all my money, including shipping.  i had it for about 5 days...the 200MG that comes with T-mobile is a total rip off....i got a msg flash on my screen that i was out of data with 2hrs of creating an account.  I then purchased 1G for $10 for 30days.  less tha 24hrs later a msg flashed across my screen that advised i was out of data...this time i was unable to the $10 offerfor 30days.  the only purchase i cld make was 1g for 7 days at a cost of$15.  I did watch some videos but i watch only about 4 n they were all under 10 mins.  I made the $15 purchse....after this purchase the bottom fell out....My chromebook began to wrk super slow n I each time i attemted to watch a videp....all it wld dowas buffer.  i call t_mobile on a sunday at 8pm...I spoke to 7 different ppl in tech support and none of them cld help me....I was on the with the last tech i spoke with for about 30mins....finally she advised she had tried all she cld and gave me 2 ph#s to HP....I contacted amazon that nite for a refund. once the $15 charge i made to t-mobile for 1g of date hit my cc i called the disputes dept to reverse the charge...once i explaind the issue to the CC CSR, she placed me on hold for about 3 mins.  when she came back she advised a $15 credit wld be refunded to my car....I will parchase another Chromebook but i will also purchase a USB adapter that will allow me to connect via an ethernet."],["My unit arrived in pristine condition(although repackaged). The laptop is easy to set up and get working. I love the fact that it is fast,fluid and exactly what I was looking for. Having said that, I was disappointed in the fact that the Tmobile sim card was missing so there was no way to have access to the 200mb of free data this was supposed to have. I've contacted customer service and for the first time ever they were of no help. I've since purchased a seperate Tmobile sim card from Amazon to see if this works. It seems like such a hassle to return an entire unit just for a sim card."],["One of the best laptops I have used. Has everything I need and nothing I don't.

Give it a try see what you think!"],["I was completely surprised with how simple it was to get setup, and was off and running within minutes of opening the box.  The way some things work with the interface and keyboard took a little time to get used to.  The performance, simplicity and usability have all exceeded my expectations, and this has completely replaced my old laptop."],["Great product. Not compatible (yet) with a lot of software, but incredibly fast, easy to use, and great for just surfing the web and creating documents."],["I cannot tell you how much I love my chromebook.  There is no doubt in my mind that this is absolutely the way of the future.  I hate when I have to power up and use my old laptop (I don't have a printer with cloud printing capability yet)  as I have been so spoiled by my chromebook's speed.At first I was a little weary about not having iTunes to manage my music, however after a while I decided to give google play a try, and I was not disappointed.  It automatically uploaded all of my songs from iTunes for me, and you can store up to 50,000 songs in the cloud for free.While the screen may not be the greatest, the only time I notice is when I've got my old laptop up next to it.  Not to mention the chromebook was about a quarter of the original price of my laptop.The free year of data from T-Mobile is a nice touch, but I have hardly ever used it.  I generally compute at home or other wifi-enabled locations, and T-Mobile doesn't have the greatest coverage in my area.  However, I have heard that AT&T;'s sim cards work as well, and since I have a plan through them already, I will probably get one in the future for this."],["Very skeptical at first since I have always owned macbooks or regular windows laptops.  But now I am convinced in what Google is telling us - this is the future of computing.  Lots of apps, storage in the cloud, no more downloading updates as you always get the latest app real time.  App selection is enormous for just about anything you need including games.  My kids use this for school and this has now become the main laptop for all in the house.As for this HP 14 model:  Very nice build quality, really nice, big HD screen and the battery life I have been getting 7 to 8 hours consistently.  In fact I have been going two to 3 days without a charge under light usage.  The processor is very quick and I love the fact that you can just shut the cover and open instantly to what you were doing. Video chats and a host of other technologies will keep you busy.  Keyboard is a light touch but still good - not quite like a lenovo or macbook.  The outside cover is grippy which is really nice for carrying.  Lots of USB and slots for display, and memory. The best part of this is with chrome you never have to worry about virus software etc..As for the t-mobile 4g - I think its the icing on the cake.  If you get good reception it is fast.  If not then its like any other cell phone data speeds when downloading.  It worked nicely on a trip as the kids used it in the back of the car with no complaints.  It is free and if you exceed the total data limit it just throttles you down for the month.  No bills.  If you want you can purchase additional bandwidth by the day or monthly which is nice again if you are travelling.Overall, I am very happy with this purchase and definitely worth the bargain price especially as everything moves to the cloud."],["Chromebook may not be for everybody but for me it is fantastic.

I just love this thing!"],["Updated:  I started off giving this 3 stars, saying that I would probably give this 3.5 stars, if I could.  I've since decided to increase it to four. It's just really great having this machine.The Chromebook has many pluses but some drawbacks too.  At times I've gotten irritated with them.  I got it from the W mart several months ago.  I think, first of all, that the list price of $350 is a little too much. If it was less, I might have given it four stars because I wouldn't have been expecting as much out of it.  So, yes, price is relevant when rating my satisfaction with an item such as this.I really did my research before purchasing, and knew most of it's limitations.  The thing I was most surprised by was the java issue.  I wasn't fully aware of that part.  It's become increasingly irritating, as over time I've gone to more websites in which things won't display properly or I can't do a simple thing and I see that java error thing on the bottom of the page.  So, to me it is a real wonder how anyone can claim that this has fully replaced their Windows-based or Mac computer- how can those people can access any site no problem, when I can't.  Is there some secret I don't know about??  And when I say I'm encountering these java issues, I'm not talking about just game sites.  I'm speaking of normal sites, stores, businesses, etc.- not trying to do anything fancy or complex.  Before buying it, I had the impression that I wouldn't have any problems with simple things like that.Another smaller but annoying issue is the sound.  It's simply not loud enough- well also a bit tinny.  But it's much lower than my laptops' max volumes.  One reason I wanted this machine was for watching YouTube videos on and listening to music and audio books on YouTube or similar sites.  So there are times when it's not loud enough, and if I'm doing some cleaning or cooking and wanted to listen to videos/music while doing that, it becomes more of an issue as I need it even louder while doing tasks.I don't find any problem with the screen as some have complained about.  No, it's not the best screen you'll ever see, but it's clear and decent enough.  So, people should stop comparing it to the screen of the smaller HP chromebook, the 11, because that Chromebook isn't nearly as good in other ways- doesn't have the same powerful processor.As far as the fan, it does make noise and is noticeable when in a quiet room, but it's not too loud.The keyboard isn't great like I hoped for typing longer emails, reports, etc.  My fingers have actually started to almost hurt at times if typing for a while.  I also make significantly more errors than when typing on my laptop.  The overall feel/texture of the keys could be better too. However, it seems that other Chromebooks have very similar keyboards.A couple of times the Chromebook froze on me. Well, I'm not certain what occurred in some instances.  One time, maybe even twice, I had left it on and came back to find that it had mysteriously restarted on it's own.  I have no idea what happened, if it had frozen, or what. (Has this happened to anyone else?) Another time, I was using it and it froze in the middle of shopping on a website.  It wouldn't turn off at first.  This doesn't happen on my laptops, which are kind of old and not Macs or anything.  For me, a computer completely freezing like that was a thing of the past, something that often happened to my late 90s/early 00's era computers.Some of the best things about this Chromebook are how fast it is, how quickly and easily it turns on, and how portable it is.  Not to mention not having to worry about updates, figuring out which ones it needs or doesn't, the built-in protection. And if I think a website is a little sketchy, I won't go on it on my laptop, but instead can feel comfortable with accessing it on the Chromebook.  It's a great EXTRA computer to have around.  But I still think the price could've been a little lower.  I haven't even tried the 4g connection yet, but I have read that it's a limited amount of data per month, and also that it's not a great connection and T-Mobile is pretty spotty.  The 2GB model without the 4g is probably more worth the price.  Also, from what I'm reading it's still pretty fast even having half the RAM, and so unless you really want the 4g connection, I would probably recommend going with the 2GB model.  It's not like you can do heavy gaming or use Adobe art programs or things like that on it anyway, so it's not like it needs a huge amount of RAM.  Of course I haven't tried the 2GB model, so I can't speak from experience, but from what I've heard and read it's still fast.  While I can't say I regret getting this, I maybe should have gone for either the cheaper model or the Acer C720, which has the same processor though screen is smaller, but MUCH cheaper.Another thing is that the Chrome browser itself is a bit glitchy at times.  I had used it on my laptop before getting the Chromebook, but not as much as I do now.  So now the glitches are more noticeable, and the problem with how the history is set up inefficiently (for someone who has always relied heavily on history) is more annoying.  I wish I could put Firefox on it, but unless I do that Ubuntu trick, I suppose I can't.  And I do think about doing that, but I'd be afraid to mess it up as I've had no experience with Ubuntu/Linux, or messing with computers in that way.  Still, it's a very fast browser whether using it on my Chromebook or my Windows laptop.I will update this if anything changes, and am willing to increase my rating, especially if I find out of any fix for these issues.  But for now, after giving it time, these are my feelings on it."],["Compared to what you can get in the same machine on a Windows computer at the same price, this is a steal (sub $350 won't even come close to touching Mac).  Intel Haswell CPU, 4 gigs of RAM and solid state hard drive make for a super fast and smooth operation.Of course, if you are expect a Windows/Mac software experience you are looking in the wrong place.  Chrome OS will give you all of the basic computer programs you'll need (word processing, spreadsheets, photo editing, etc..), but they are not quite as developed as their Microsoft/Apple counterparts.The other great thing about this laptop is that you can simply get it to run Linux.  I did this to have a web development environment and it works great (I used Crouton to install Linux).  Linux has a ton of free programs and is super stable.So, if you don't think you need all the standard programs that come with Windows/Mac and you'll be using this for mostly web browsing (and even programming), I highly recommend this machine.  The 4G card is also very handy, although I have not used it much. Also, the hard drive storage is pretty low, but you can always get an a SD card or just use in-the-cloud storage, which is incredibly easy to come by now."],["I've been a Mac guy since I got my Macbook Pro in the summer of 2011.  And I'm still a Mac guy no doubt.  But after having used many computers from WIndows 8 laptops to the Chromebook, I'm going to say this is my #2 computer.  Nothing will replace my Macbook Pro, but this Chromebook is a very close second.The positives about this are many.  The Tmobile radio built in means you get 4GB of RAM instead of only 2GB of RAM when you buy the non-Tmobile radio version.  That alone makes the $50 seem inconsequential.  Tmobile is giving away 200MB a month of free data, for at least 2 years.  That is really cool for those times you are in a pinch and need to connect for an email or something and aren't near WIFI.  I'd say the battery life at 7 or 8 hours is very reasonable.  The keyboard is a pleasure to type on.  And the trackpad is the only trackpad that actually works great other than the Macbook Pro.  The trackpad cannot be overstated; having tried many, most are unusable and some are okay but not consistent.  This trackpad works great!  The screen is big and bright, and while not the quality of a Macbook Pro, it is good.  Getting the right viewing angle (tilted back like it is supposed to be) makes it as good as it can be.The negatives of this are only a few.  Printing is impossible unless you have a printer plugged into a home computer and setup the Google Cloud Print, or buy a Google Cloud Printer.  It isn't often I print but when I do, it is frustrating.  Some websites don't like Chrome and that can cause frustrations as well.  And really the most important thing I can say is that this is a Chromebook, not a traditional computer.  Everything lives in a browser.  And once you get past that, it is okay.Once you realize the shortcomings (printing for example) there are workarounds.  You can hit CTRL P and package your page into a PDF so it can be emailed to a computer at home that has a printer.  Or that you can do just about everything you can do with a computer with this via a browser or an extension into the browser, makes the idea of a browser based computer okay.  There is an \"offline\" mode so you can review/create/etc. some documents and such when not connected to the web.I'd say that if you want to spend $350 for this vs. $1200 for a Macbook Pro, you'll get most of the good experience you'd get out of something more expensive.  For me, I just browse the web, send some emails, and every once in awhile edit a document or spreadsheet and this computer does the job.There is no onboard email client, again, this is all done through a browser.  I miss my email client, but I can live with this idea of checking emails by signing in on the two different sites that host my email.  I can save the username and password so clicking a link on the browser bar and it loads me right to my inbox.  Google also offers lots of great things, like Gmail, Google Drive for storing documents and pictures, Google Voice so you can take/make phone calls and texts, and there are many more services I don't even use.I tried a Chromebook a year ago or so and it wasn't something I could get into.  The screens were small and weak.  The problem with offline services hadn't been figured out yet.  But all of that is in the past.  I'd say that this is an awesome value and you won't be disappointed.  Funny, someone saw me using this and said \"Hey is that a color hard shell for your Macbook Pro?\"  I had to show them that this wasn't a Macbook Pro.  It looks that good.  And while this is plastic, it feels solid and not cheesy like other laptops that creak and click as you use them.Go ahead, if you are on the fence about this, you won't be disappointed.UPDATE:  6 months into using this Chromebook, I have no regrets.  It works, gets regular updates automatically, still has amazing battery life, and the 4g LTE radio came in handy a few times when internet at home was down or was in a place with no WIFI.  It is lightweight, sturdy, and all around the best value in a basic computer that I have ever had.  The only thing I really wish was different was that the screen was a higher resolution.  It is okay, and I use it for hours without issue, but the contrast begs to be  changed.  You cannot.  You can adjust brightness of the screen and you can even get a widget from Google to apply higher contrast, but neither really address this issue.  I have read that newer models will come with better screens, but that is such a small point for such a great value.  I have worked on it for hours without any issue, and it is an amazingly fast computer for what I mostly do when I'm home - surf the web and do emails.  So, without hesitation, you should order this if you think you might be in the market for something to browse web pages and check email.  It can do more, but if you get into serious stuff, you might want to consider something a bit more advanced - like a mac."],["01/20/2014 Update This weekend my daughter asked me for a HDMI Cable.

The Trackpad is amazing, once you learn the Chrome Commands. 2 finger scrolls up and down. Hold 2 fingers down for right click. It is so darned intelligent. The Pearl color is elegant and the laptop looks far more expensive then it's price. I asked a coworker to play with it and she concurred. This definitely doesn't look or feel cheap.Monitor, while not stellar is certainly adequate, I did not feel like I was looking at a low resolution monitor. It was regular. Speakers yes Tinny but hey what do you expect for$340.00Neutral: Having a 14\" Monitor and all the extras like Intel CPU, HDMI Port, USB Ports, SD Card Port and solid construction adds weight. For example the hinge for the screen is one piece going along 3/4 of the width of the screen, if it was not manufactured with weight in mind then they could have made it flimsier and lighter. More components, quality construction will add extra weight. So it is 4 pounds, plenty light for a teenager or me, If you are not looking for a full blown system and desire more of a tablet like device, then this might not be for you. I'm not taking off a star because realistically life is a series of tradeoffs.Turns out that Microsoft's scorch campaign about the Laptop being a brick when not online is BXXXXshxxxtGoogle office runs, the native movie and music player runs, and with a 64gb Sd Ram card with 9 hours of life you can watch movies, listen to music, take notes, write a paper and make a spread sheet.

Setup was also easy.Cons:- Whirring sound from fan. I originally purchased a non-4g version from Best Buy that had almost NO noise at all from the fan.  For some reason, this one was MUCH more noticeable. I have sensitive ears and it was rather annoying and I could hear the fan over videos.- No skype connectivity.- Mediocre camera.- This particular one we received had 2 small indentations on the top cover.We're seriously considering returning it and going back to the non-4g version, especially after seeing Amazon post this for this item:\"Item Under ReviewWhile this item is available from other marketplace sellers on this page, it is not currently offered by Amazon.com because customers have told us there may be something wrong with our inventory of the item, the way we are shipping it, or the way it's described here.

I bought this from Best Buy to compare the 2 before making a final decision on which to keep. Something bigger than 11\" was a requirement.The Toshiba was a nicer size in terms of weight than the HP and had much better and louder sound. However, there were more cons that helped us decide to keep the HP 14\" in the end. Keep in mind, this is stuff that my wife AND kids noticed and I even ran them side by side to watch a movie on Amazon prime.Toshiba Cons:- The screen on the Toshiba was more washed out compared to the HP.  Colors and picture were more true to life on the HP and the blacks on the Toshiba were distorted, especially in darker scenes.- HP was slightly faster than the Toshiba in moving around the screen and doing things.  This may have been because of the extra 2gb ram but it was noticeable nonetheless.- Keyboard and mouse were much more comfortable and quieter to use on the HP than the Toshiba.  Fit and finish is just overall better on the HP.- Toshiba ran much warmer to the touch after watching the same movie for the same duration..about 45 minutes."],["Read all the reviews before making this purchase.

Lets get down to the details as to why it is so great.- Attractive color. I own the white one and the color gives it a sense of simple, clean and sophistication. The coral and Turquoise are nice colors, however they bug the eyes to much. The white is the perfect alternative.-Super fast. At the beginning when I started to use it for the first time it was a bit slow and this had worried me. The pages took a bit to start up however that only lasted less than 5 minutes. After the first heavy graphics page I opened was opened It work perfectly. The proceeding times I opened the page it went incredibly fast, it was just the first time that didn't go immediately fast. (But it was straight of the box never used before so I assume that's why.)-It is silent, I had read certain reviews that the fan was super loud. If that is the case then take it back because it might be damaged. It is so quiet it just gives more peace. I can't hear the fans working at all though they are fully working.-No heat. It gives off no heat what so ever. After 5 hours of nonstop use on a heavy webpage I had expected it to be heated up. Yet surprisingly it was completely cool.-Amazing battery life. Now here I had read negative reviews. HP claims it has a good 5 hours of battery life. Some reviewer have said they get about 5 or less hours. However I seem to get at least 8 hours of batter life even with nonstop use. It is great because I do not have to get up in the middle of what I am doing to charge it,-Beautiful retina. Personally the picture quality is great. Some say its a bit lacking, however this one is for a personal opinion because I think all the pictures I have seen are beautiful.-Light weight. It is light, there are lighter out there but in comparison it is pretty light. Perfect to carry around.DISCLAIMER: This is not like a regular computer, you cannot save files directly on the hard drive. So if you are looking for a computer to edit photos, movies, or music this is not for you. This computer is completely dependent on the chrome web browser.

Sitting at my desk with this in front of me, I have no issues and no complaints with it. Usage is pretty much self explanatory and everything works exactly how it's supposed to.

Color is great and in W7 the touch is right.  Now in W8 it was not as easy ! the driver that were installed were not the correct ones.. it looked to be W7 drivers and the touch was off.  The target was about   inch away from  where your finger was aiming at.  HP has W8 Drivers which will solve that problem .. so go get them before you start the  install.

I haven't owned a touch screen monitor for any of my desktop computers until this and I am extremely thrilled with it. The colors are exquisite. Everything looks so unbelievably crisp and vibrant on the screen. I can't believe the vast difference between this and the other three 20-23 inch screens in my home. This is far superior. I love the stand that it rests on. Very cool looking from the side. Looks amazing sitting on the desk in my bedroom.The touch screen itself is flawless and works without a hitch. Things flow smoothly off the screen when you touch and swipe. I have really only used this for the Windows 8 main menu and for photo viewing so far as well as some basic game testing. I haven't done everything possible with this bad boy yet but it is still amazing.The speakers are also great. I am impressed with the sound quality that is coming from them. Very nice.Overall, brilliant looking screen with amazing touch screen abilities. Love everything about it!

After hooking the computer to my Windows 8 computer I began experimenting with the touch screen for the first time.  I absolutely love it, it basically turns your monitor into a giant tablet.  Allows a popup keyboard as well, which allows me to maintain a streamlined look, but still able to pull out a physical keyboard for longer typing sessions.  The monitor is well built and has an awesome kickstand in the back, making it easy to set at a couple different angles, or to mount to the wall.  I thought the speaker quality was good, but obviously most people will still want to hook up their own external speakers for better sound.At first I was worried that the touchscreen would be finicky, or not all that responsive, but it is excellent.  Just as accurate and precise as my iPad.  This monitor will be on my desk for a long while.If you're looking for a way to improve your Windows 8 experience, or just shopping for an excellent touch screen monitor, this product is amazing.

The sound quality is great you can hear from anywhere in the room."],["It's a very good monitor. Nice view, like built in speakers. If you don't have this monitor you need to try it out..."],["Windows 8, without a touchscreen, is terrible in my opinion. It drives me absolutely bonkers when trying to navigate without any way to easily traverse the system. If you buy something new it is going to come with it too, and if you really want to use it properly you need to go that extra mile and get a monitor. That noted, the question becomes \"what touchscreen do you want?\"So far, I love this monitor. Even the way it was packed was impressive, with the delivery company manhandling it and even damaging the box but it coming out unscathed. It has a crisp display and the colors are vibrant. Really, really vibrant. a lot of companies tout how great their colors are and most of the time I've at least somewhat disappointed, but I have no complaints here. Granted, I've yet to try it out with a smaller device but I have hooked it to my desktop and my laptop and I've loved it. It was easy to set up and the instructions were user-friendly, which is nice in a time where paper instructions are becoming a rarity. Add the sound to the mix and you have a great media experience. Normally I end up thinking I have to buy a set of external speakers, but this has been really nice. I haven't noticed any type of lag between touching it and it doing, which has been nice with the games I've been playing both online and DLed into my computer. You add in the HDMI connection and you are good to go rather quickly.It is kind of heavy; I suppose that's a touchscreen downside in the age of portable electronics, but it isn't that bad once set up. It has a kickstand that folds out when situated, not bad for propping it up and allowing you to interact, and is sturdy. I figured it might have a USB port on it but it does not, which isn't a huge issue but still. That said, these are minor issues with an otherwise great addition to the home setup."],["When I received this, I was a bit puzzled at the size of the box.  I have a 24\" monitor at the office and it came in a *much* smaller box.  As it turns out, this monitor has a really large bezel around it (look closely at the picture) which it somewhat disguised by having glass around the picture. It's 1-3/4\" wide on the sides and top and 3-1/4\" on the bottom.  In fact, if you had a super thin bezel monitor, you'd be up in the 28\" range. I suspect that this is in due in large part to the touch screen functionality.  I'd imagine they would want at least \" or so around the display just so you could still touch items at the edge of the screen, but it does make this one *massive* monitor.That said, it's really wild being able to touch and multi-touch items, kind of like a 23\" tablet.Image quality is outstanding - contrast and refresh make my older Dell Ultrasharp and Samsung Syncmaster pale in comparison.  However, I did notice that the resolution isn't as sharp as I would like.  This isn't HP's fault - 1920x1080 is very standard for 23\" screens, but in tablet mode you tend to be a lot closer.  For example, my Syncmaster 243T 24\" monitor at work is 1920 x 1200, but it sits more than an arm's length from me.  If you are used to the higher resolution on phones (The latest 5\" smart phones have the SAME resolution as this monitor - 1920x1080) then it's a bit of a surprise to suddenly be able to see jaggies on letters.Sound is great - I'm using an HDMI cable, which means no extra sound connection required.  There isn't a separate volume or brightness control on the monitor - you have to go through menus to change them - not so convenient.A USB cord was all that was needed to get the touch screen up and running.  There are several games (e.g. Chalkboard) that work very well with this.  No lag on the touchscreen whatsoever.  One thing you will need to do if you are running an extended display is to make the HP the primary display.  At first I was touching the screen, but it was showing up on the other monitor.A couple of nitpicks - power button on the front would be nice - on the corner/side I keep hitting it inadvertently or I can't get to it (When I have it set on the desk in multi-monitor)  Also, why no USB port?  It would have been pretty trivial to put a couple of slots in.  Headphone placement is good, so can't complain there.Likes- Fantastic contrast, color, brightness- LED illumination saves energy- Plug and play- Clean cable routing- Tilt angles well for tablet use- Touch screen very responsive- Sound qualityDislikes- Massive bezel- Power button not well placed- No USB ports"]],"title":"HP Pavilion 23TM 23-inch Touchscreen LED Monitor","total_reviews":25,"sentiment":0.765556,"label":"positive","best_review":["Good quality monitor, does exactly what it is supposed to do, arrived quickly, great value for the money.

After receiving it, I noted that it didn't look very well made. Since I've been through quite a number of bags, I've learned what to look for as far as quality is concerned. This one seemed to be pretty flimsy, and seemed to have poor stitching with thin, cheapo materials. However, I also know how difficult it is to find a full-sized bag with expandability and usable compartments that doesn't look like some ugly, trendy, brightly-colored trekking gear. So, this bag certainly has the aesthetics down pact. Despite my misgivings about the quality, I loaded it up with my laptop, accessories, and LOTS of notes, papers, and books. This wasn't for abuse, or testing or anything. This is what I always carry.This back pack had held up well, until about two months after having this backpack, it started ripping at the left arm strap. With all I carry, one would expect it to rip due to the load, however, it is ripping on the side of the strap on the part that holds the (VERY THIN, crappy) shoulder pad material in. So, I sewed it back shut. Then it started ripping on the top interior of the laptop compartment near the zipper. Functionality wasn't affected, however, this wasn't what one would want to happen. I sewed that up, as well, and haven't really had any other issues with this pack so far.Overall, it's a really nice pack that could be made to be much better had they used better materials, and maybe placed a few locking flaps on some of the compartments. All of the internal compartments are wide open pockets, so if you place your loaded backpack on..., oh say..., a baggage scanner at the airport, the contents of those pockets will probably slide out. Ask me how I know. It's not that big of a deal for me, but something to consider. Additionally, the shoulder padding (think very thin black packing foam), back padding, and thin nylon (thinner than normal backpacks I think) all leave more to be desired. However, I suppose in this day and age, this is more than acceptable.I'm going to use it as a template to try and make my own here soon. If I weren't going to try to make my own, I would certainly just buy another one of these."],["It's a very comfortable backpack!!

This backpack has style, comfort, ease, and reliability all in 1 package. The main compartment for laptops is quite large and offers well put together protection.

The padding was put together very nicely. The construction feels very nice and seems well put together. There are a few loose seams here and there (and I really mean only a few) but they are not in any spots I'd deem worthy of causing the pack to fall apart, it is a sturdy backpack.Overall I highly recommend this backpack, there's really no better deal for the quality and price.

It doesn't feel cheap. The camera is also nice, despite its only 5mp(no flash), it has auto focus and a set of potions to play around with it. The stylus pen its rather good, surprisingly it feels heavy for a pen. I might order one for my slate 7 plus. The only 2 and half cons are, its still running on JB 4.2 no word on HP if it will ever release 4.3 or move to Kit Kat, kind of strange given this is a rebranded Tegra note and that one NV already release the update to Kit Kat, so why won't HP do the same?

I researched this device quite a bit prior to purchase, so although it is flawed, I knew what to expect going in.At first glance it is a nice looking tablet, reminiscent in style to the HTC One cell phone. It is light and feels good in the hand and in my opinion, it looks much better that the Tegra Note 7.I had hoped that since this device was HP's version of the Note 7, the build quality would be at least slightly better. I was willing to gamble the looks and build quality against the Note's updated OS.Sadly, I lost the bet. The ports are indeed as difficult and flimsy feeling as many others have reported. Usually people mention the mini-USB connector, but in addition, I found that the SD card slot also does not line up, so the first time I inserted a card, it actually went in between the body of the tablet and the actual card slot causing the card to become stuck. (thank God for needle-nose pliers) Beyond the ports, the body creaks and rough edges abound. The low-resolution screen is pretty lack-luster, and viewing the screen in slightly harsh lighting reveals the grid embedded in the LCD.So what if anything do I like? I like the size (easily pocketable for me), the looks, the speed, and the stylus. A tablet that includes these features in a really well-built package would have me ready to buy in an instant.I did have trouble setting up some of my email accounts. After configuration, the process would hang while the tablet reported that it was waiting for the account to sync and that the emails would arrive soon.  Eventually I found that if you go into &#34;settings&#34; then &#34;data usage&#34; you can click on the 3 dots in the top right corner of the window and enable &#34;auto-sync data&#34;.

It is a Tegra Note based tablet, coming with a very narrow-point stylus that can be used for drawing and sketching in Android applications including Sketchbook Pro.

The problem with it is the  stylus is a little small and hard to get used to. Passive styli for other tablets work, but always draw at 'full pressure' and end up drawing large lined with little or no subtlety. I'd like if there was a pen-sized fine-point stylus for this, and will likely buy a spare stylus to cobble one together from the stylus and an old pen casing.

One thing worth noting is that the S7E is a rebrand of the Tegra Note 7; it has the EXACT same specs, but better build quality. If you happen to be reading this review because you're trying to decide between the Note 7 and S7E, I'd say go with the HP.The only other decent 7 inch tablet options were a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 (way overpriced for the hardware inside) and the Kindle Fire HDX (great hardware, but runs a heavily modified version of Android and is basically &#34;Amazon - now in tablet form!&#34;). Between my final three choices, I ended up cutting the Sero 7 Pro out because it's very difficult to find for a reasonable price, and because it noticeably lags behind the other two in terms of performance. Therefore, my final two choices were the N7 and the S7E. At first, I was going to go with the N7 because it's the reigning king of bang for your buck 7 inch tablets, but after comparing the two, I realized that the S7E was an even better value.First, let's talk about specs. The S7E has a quad-core Tegra 4 processor with each core clocked up to 1.8GHz (and a fifth core for behind the scenes operations). The N7, on the other hand, has an older quad-core Tegra 3 with each core clocked up to 1.5GHz. Clear win for the S7E here. Next, I'll compare the screens. The S7E has a 1280x800 screen, while the N7 boasts a 1920x1280 screen. The N7 has more pixels-per-inch (PPI) and a sharper screen, but honestly, you're not going to notice the difference on a 7 inch tablet unless your nose is touching the screen. Win here for the N7, but it's fairly inconsequential unless you're really anal about screen quality.Moving onto RAM, the S7E has 1GB and the N7 has 2GB. This is another win for the N7, but in actual performance, the S7E's improved processor is enough to make up for the difference and blow the N7 away. Capacity wise, both tablets come with 16GB of space (the N7 also has a 32GB version), but the S7E has expandable storage while the N7 doesn't. Big win for the S7E, in my opinion. Google doesn't include expandable storage on the N7 because they want you to store everything in the Cloud, but I much prefer being able to store things on my tablet.The last comparison I'll make is between the cameras, and this is the only real fault I find with the S7E. Both tablets have a 5 megapixel camera on their backs, and they both take okay pictures (personally, I don't use my tablet as a camera, but to each their own). Both tablets are also equipped with a front-facing camera, but they differ a bit here. The N7 has a 1.2MP front-facing camera, while the S7E's is only 0.3MP. The front-facing camera on the S7E is honestly horrible, and it's basically useless for video chatting because the quality is just that bad. This is the only aspect of the S7E that's truly bad, and I find it unacceptable that a top of the line tablet in the year 2014 is still using such a low quality camera. This is obviously a big win for the N7, and if one of your top priorities is a good front facing camera, you may want to choose the N7.After looking at the specs, the N7 and S7E are fairly similar, aside from the S7E having a much improved processor. What good are specs though, right? Performance is what actually matters. And that's where the S7E is simply better than the N7 and it's not even debatable. Despite having less RAM, the S7E is faster than the N7, can multitask better than the N7, and can run more intensive games than the N7. The battery life of the S7E suffers a bit thanks to its powerful hardware, but it still gets 8-9 hours on a full charge (compared to 10 or so for the N7), and that should be enough for most people.So, at this point, you might be saying, &#34;Alright, so the S7E is faster, but I still don't see why it's such a better value.&#34; Let me introduce you to the included stylus of the S7E. In the same vein as the Galaxy Note series, the S7E includes a stylus that you can write on the screen with. Many recent tablets have started to experiment with stylus technology, but honestly, most of them just aren't very good. Many of them have lag problems, or problems with the screen not correctly reading the stylus input. I'm happy to say, however, that the S7E's stylus works flawlessly and is very, very accurate and zippy. I'm a student, so the ability to take handwritten notes is invaluable to me, and it's made even better by the fact that the stylus for the S7E works about as well as any tablet on the market. It should be obvious that the inclusion of a stylus is a HUGE win for the S7E here; the N7 can't even begin to complete because even if you bought a stylus for it, you'd be paying more money and it wouldn't work as well because the N7's screen isn't designed for stylus use.So, let's recap: The S7E has a much better processor than the N7, comes with a stylus that works incredibly well, and is $30 cheaper. The N7, on the other hand, has a nicer screen, slightly better battery life, a better front facing camera, and better OS support (the N7 gets updates faster because it's made directly by Google). Which one is better for you obviously depends on what you're looking for in a tablet, but for me, the choice was obvious: The S7E was the better value, and I couldn't be happier with it. The N7 is a great tablet in its own right, but it just can't stand up to the performance, features or price of the S7E. You certainly had a nice reign as the king of 7 inch tablets, Nexus 7, but I'm afraid it's time to...Move, Nexus 7, get out the way, get out the way Nexus 7, get out the way. Why? Because there's a new tablet in town, and you just can't hang."],["What can be said about this tablet other then its one of the best 7\" tablets on the market.only to its clone (The Tegra Note 7) and Google's Nexus 7 2013. for the price, performance and features you cant go wrong."],["I would recommend this product to really anyone who needs a reliable compact device for internet surfing.

Also, the rubber nib on the stylus is starting to fray and tiny bits are breaking off after only a few weeks of use, I've searched for replacement nibs but can't find any, and the HP site wants $19.99 for a new one. That's 10% of the price of the tablet, what a rip off...update, I lowered the brightness of the screen a little to save battery life, and the screen now stays the same brightness while reading books, I don't know why but it is..."],["this tablet is fast, very fast, loads webpage very quickly...i use my tablet for movies but though a 1200 by 800 resoution , the screen seems quite low graded, blacks look grey and times , screen not bad, but compare to my kindle hd  with same resoulation it seems poor , hp had to make some cuts , for the price 199.00 if you want a super fast tab this is the oneCool feature is the battery saver , you can set it to 2 cores to save battery...great for gaming..."],["I've only owned the device for about 3 days now but I can say that I am satisfied enough to keep it. I'll keep it short and simple. This Device is AWESOME! The Tegra 4 processor allows me to play pretty much every game I throw at it at 55-60fps. I can't stress this enough. It really can tear through anything you throw at it and as a gamer this is a huge plus. Despite 1gb of ram the processor compensates for it. In terms of resolution I see no problems. I have browsed the web and watched HD videos and they look great. Bear in Mind a lower resolution means that games are easier to handle which is a plus compared to the nexus 7. I've read some ebooks and I have no problems doing so.I'd like to comment on the Stylus. When I Originally purchased it the stylus was a secondary feature to me but I ended up really liking it. Its thin, feels well built and is very precise and I tend to use it more and more for browsing and keying in words, this is a nice addition that was unexpected.First and foremost there has been immense confusion regarding this and the EVGA tegra note 7 which is designed on the same build storage capacity. I can say after testing (un)officially that this device DOES SUPPORT 64GB SD CARDS! EVA note can also do the same.  It has to be formatted to FAT32 so in reality this has a max of 64+16 = 80gb (minus O.S. system storage). To do this you need a program and google can take of that. I'm using a Sandisk Ultra class 10 and I would recommend nothing other one than this.The build quality is very good. It has a very solid feel and I chose this after getting feedback regarding the EVGA Tegra note build quality. This is well made and feels solid so I'm very happy with that.I'd like to comment on another area of interest. The Usb slot. Usb user have noted that the slot feels weak/unsteady and people have problems putting it in. This includes the tegra note which is a design issue with nvidia's chassis. It does need to be put in the upright position as you could possibly put it upside down if your not paying attention and damage/break the slot. When you put in the USB cable put it in slightly facing upward and it slips right in. Its nothing major just keeping it in mind is important.All in all i'm very satisfied with the device. Its fast, feels great, and has a ton of memory. I'm definitely happy with my purchase. Nvidia has set the bar high in the tablet space with this device."],["There are plenty of other reviews on here that hit on all the great features of this tablet and I agree with them. For the money it is the best bang for your buck around.However keep in mind these notes:!. The HP Slate 7 Extreme is unique an you may have some work cut out for you in finding proper cases and screen protectors.The screen protectors were too big and the case I ordered came in incorrectly.  - Obviously not the tablets fault.2. When gaming on this be mindful it will chew through the battery and my biggest complaint is that it didn't seem to notify me when the battery got low.  Maybe I missed it as I am still learning all the cool features on this tablet.  My fix was to install a battery saver app and I think that will help manage some the background programs that never want to close.3. Give yourself some time for initial updates. Now I am running Android Kit Kat 4.2.2 but it took two updates to get there.4. OH yeah a little hidden spec on this is that it has a magnet built in the back.  This is perfect for placing it on the fridge while your whipping up your favorite recipe from the web.So far it is a great tablet and I am very happy with it."],["I owned the EVGA Tetra 7 tablet for about a week but have switched to this HP version and like it a lot better.  The screen difference is noticable and I much prefer the round tip stylus vs the chisel tip that comes with the EVGA.  Overall it's been a good tablet and for comparison I also own the Nexus 7 (2013).  I bought it for the stylus and as other have said the one thing I miss is the vibrant 1080 screen on the Nexus.  For me it's the clarity and contrast of the display as much as the resolution.  This said it's really only an issue when they are side by side.  On it's own the screen is perfectly good. The 1GB of RAM was a worry and I have run into a few situations where I've had numerous apps open and I think I've maxed out the RAM.  WHen this happens the tablet almost completely locks up, or seems to.  Really it's just lagging and with a little patience it eventually catches up.  The few times this has happened I've done a restart and performance comes right back.  This has been rear and mainly just an annoyance.For me battery life has been good and having the sd card expansion is also great. I use the Terga slide in cover which is fantastic.  It's a little pricy at $30 but fits perfectly and acts as both a stand and an on/off switch in addition to protecting the screen.Lots of pros are mentioned in other reviews so I'll just list my cons. I docked a star for the limited RAM and for the screen which is good but not great. One other concern I have it the stylus does not fit very tight into it's slot and I am concerned over time it will become so loose that it won't stay in.For those debating the EVGA or HP I'd say the HP wins hands down EXCEPT they have not updated Android like EVGA has.  THe HP is still running 4.2 vs the EVGA which ran 4.4.  My fingers are crossed that HP will get around to it, hopefully sooner then later.Overall it's an excellent tablet for the price."],["This is the fastest 7 inch tablet on the market right now (no joke) my an tutu clocked at just over 35,000 it is blazing fast and has a Sim slot for expandable memory and has a decent 5 megapixel rear camera, great value in my opinion and I would definitely recommend it. The only con I can think of is the low battery life if your putting the processor and GPU to work. If I run GTA San Andreas (really power consuming) I get about 2-3 hours but that's about my only gripe and I can really complain since I turn the processor to max performance (you canset your pprocessor to different levels max, balance, and save battery) it also has some really neat setting for HDMI and controller."],["I would recommend this tablet to all. This is a great tablet, it does everything you would want to do. Purchased it for my Wife as a surprise now I can't get her away from it."],["For those who have put off acquiring a computer tablet, this is an entry definitely worth considering. Known as the Slate 7 Extreme, it is the middle model in a group of three. It has a faster processor, a better version of Android, more internal storage, and a sharper screen resolution than the Slate 7 Plus with just a $50 higher cost, whereas the Slate 7 HD gives you a slightly slower processor but an even sharper screen and a 4G connection (the 7 Plus and 7 Extreme provide only Bluetooth and Wi-Fi) for less than $50 more than the Extreme. So, if a connection fee (through T-Mobile) isn't on your &#34;must&#34; list, the Extreme is the model to choose. It has another feature not common to tablets---especially at this price. A slender stylus fits into the case and is activated when removed. Not just for tapping on icons and virtual keyboards, it's a passive pen using NVidia's Direct Stylus technology to provide for handwritten notes and drawing on the screen (with color options) Altogether, the Extreme gives a lot for its cost, the key drawback being its use of a version of Android (4.2.2) that isn't competitive with other tablets of similar cost."],["I won't bore you with the nuts and bolts that the other reviews do a much better job of detailing. What I will do is give my concise feelings after having owned this tablet for about a month.PROS:+ Stylus+ Is fast enough to run what I want to run (mostly multi-tasking for editing and listening to music, and little-to-no gaming)+ Speakers are loud enough that I must turn it down in many situations+ Price+ HP - they are one of my top 3 computer-makersCONS:- Truly terrible front-facing camera- Does hang up from time to time. Not sure if it's the lack of memory, poor apps used in conjunction, or what...- Not the latest Android and no updates in sight- Battery life could be betterThe important factors for me were the camera, a stylus, speakers, display, and version of Android. This is one of the few tablets that actually allows you to use a stylus, and certainly the only one that is priced reasonably. While the Android version is not the newest and greatest, it does everything I need it to do and I have not run into an app that I haven't been able to run (mostly looking at a few games, Netflix, Vine, Hulu, etc...)The front camera is absolutely horrible. They are not kidding when they say that it is a .3 megapixel camera. Some places online change it to a 1.3, but it is not. It does not autofocus, is consistently grainy, and is not suitable for use on anything other than video chat. The back camera is good, but the software added by HP to run it is not. I have been looking for an alternative, but have yet to find one that I like.The stylus is very handy. The apps bundled in are okay, but are clearly not great. Keep in mind that it is rare to find a good app on the Play Store that uses a stylus well. Be ready to do some research or willing to put up with the included apps.I am very pleased with the sound that comes out of the speakers. I am used to playing music on my phone, and it is hard to go back to it after hearing it in stereo. The sound is also loud and clear. I listen to podcasts many times, and the voices are typically too quiet or too &#34;grainy&#34; from my phone (distortion or other issues relating to the speakers on my phone). This is loud and clear.It is also pretty cool that the back of this tablet is magnetized. I can stick it to my fridge or stove top while I cook or do the dishes. The magnet is powerful enough to hold the tablet securely enough for my paranoid brain to tolerate, but not powerful enough to still work through the case I got for the tablet. Despite how weak the magnet is through the case, I still find myself being very worried about having my tablet anywhere near other electronics. I'm not sure if it would damage them, but, like I said, I'm paranoid."],["The first tablet I bought was the ASUS MeMo HD.  It died in a day.  So I decided to spend a little more and try this slate.

My TV shows looks GREAT to me, and all my apps run smoothly and quickly."],["I'm a CPA and have owned several computers, laptops and tablets, including the Blackberry Table.  The HP Slate S7 is great, vary fast and the styles pencil works grate.  Also the Note-Pad feature on the HP is great to save notes to yourself to remind you of task to complete.  I would definitely recommend this table."],["###before I start, my tablet hasn't arrive yet but my little bro got his from the HP website already.###- I borrow my little bro HP slate 7 extreme to test it out while waiting for mine to arrive from amazon. The build quality is much much better than the tegra note 7 but same spec wise. The tegra note make this weird squeak noise when I press too hard on the back cover but the HP slate 7 extreme is very solid and doesn't make any noise.#display- I still don't get how 1280800 is consider as standard these days. Too me, its perfectly fine and clears to see. I know that most people can't go below the 1080 HD display and need something like the new nexus 7 2013 or kindle fire hdx for example. My sister own it and I try it out before. The screen is very dazzlingly amazing but I don't really need it, 720p is good enough for me. If you have ever own the 1st nexus 7 2012, this tablet display is the same.#performance- the is the reason why I choose this over the nexus 7 2013 or kindle fire hdx. But before that, this tablet only has 1gb ram which today is consider as low/not enough while both kindle fire hdx/ nexus 7 2013 have 2gb ram. You may think will 1gb ram be enough for daily task etc....but remember, this tablet is couped with an Nvidia Tegra 4 chip it. This tablet is whopping fast and I meant like fast faster than the kindle fire hdx and nexus 7 2013 especially when it come into gaming. So far, there is no lag or what so ever while playing games, browsing, email etc...so basically 1gb ram in this is like having 2gb ram. I know people these days use benchmark etc to compare performance wise. This tablet score over 40k on the antutu benchmark test which is insanely high or at least the highest I have seen so far.#gaming- I have try modern combat 3-4, nova 3, dead trigger 2, asphalt 8, gt racing 2, amazing spiderman, the dark night rises, dungeon hunter 4, iron man 3, archangle etc....pretty much all the heavy games that require lots of power to run and I could say its probably the best experience I had ever had playing game on a tablet....this tablet just smash all those games like nothing even though its only coupe with 1gb ram but the display also help it too unlike the nexus or kindle where its pushing all those pixel on their HD screen like the nexus 72013, its sometimes lag and I meant lagging pretty bad while playing some of these heavy games. Not surprise considering the snapdragon s4 pro is pretty weak compare snapdragon 800 which can be found in the kindle fire hdx or this tablet, HP slate 7 extreme. If your a heavy gamer, than this tablet is probably more suited to you.# battery- the battery life is on pare with nexus 7 2013 which is about 8-10 hrs depending on how you use it.#camera- the front camera is only 0.3.....while the nexus and kindle is 1.2 i think. The back is the same as nexus/kindle which is 5.0 but the HP slate 7 extreme take a better pic.#stylus pen- like the galaxy note tablet, this tablet has a stylus pen which is on the bottom. You can find some videos on YouTube about it being used.# conclusion, for the price of $199, HP slate 7 extreme is a very good deal. If your into gaming or like to take notes than this is for you and if you don't care not having an HD screen like the nexus or kindle.##Update 1/1/14---- receive mine 2 days ago on the 30th. I have been using it nonstop every single days now and holy cow, this thing is just too darn fast! Who said 1gb ram is not enough for multi task??!!! Cause this is just flying like crazy!.. I have no lag while using it which is really impresses. I have 5 apps running on the background and this didn't even slow the OS down at all! What's more amazing is that, in setting, there are 3 options for maximum performance(4 core running and no fps lock), balance( 4 core running but fps lock to 60) and power saver mode(1 core running and fps lock to 30 plus only at 1.8ghz).... And am using power save mode....now do you understand the logic behind this? Yes, there are a big difference between power saver mode and maximun mode. In maximun mode, this tablet just literally destroy every things I throw at it, let it be browsing, gaming, multi task etc....I can now say, this is the best android tablet I have own and I have own a few tablet that are android and iOS like the iPad 2/3 and nexus 10, nexus 2012 and galaxy note 2012. Overall, definitely buy this if your into gaming cause this is probably the closest you could get near IOS in gaming performance if you know what I meant......get this....cheers."],["I have had this tablet for about a week now and I have to say it is great!  I had a two year old 10 in Toshiba Thrive that I used mostly for reading, listening to music, and a few apps such as Facebook, Pinterest and Feedly and that is all I really did with my tablet.  The Thrive was bulky and heavy so I was looking to downsize to a 7 inch.  I wanted something affordable, but not a cheap no name tablet that would be questionable.  I was initially looking at the Google Nexus and the Kindle Fire HD.  I have family members that have these tablets,so I had a chance to look at those fairly closely.  I decided not to get the Kindle based on the restriction to the Amazon App store which left me with the Google.  I got a random email advertising the HP Slate 7 Extreme and after looking it over, I decided it was best for me.  It has everything the Google Nexus does with the exception of the writing ability and that is what sold me.  I am a note and list writer and I have tried to use note apps, but oh the typing (which I hate).  I would then have notepads filling up my purse and strewn across my desk at work.  It is fabulous to be able to use this tablet to write and save notes.  Another feature I like are the front facing speakers since I listen to a lot of music.  Several reviews mentioned screen resolution as a negative, but I am coming from a dinosaur tablet and the screen resolution is so improved that I have no problems with it.  The only downside I have found is finding a case.  None of the ones sold by Amazon will fit this model.  I did go to Wal-Mart and find a universal one that seems to do the trick, except the camera hole doesn't line up.  I use my phone for photos, so I don't see that being an issue for me.

The aspect ratio is perfect on this size tablet.  I became interested in this tablet because i had recently purchased an acer a1-810 and loved the viewing area. I liked the size so much i bought one for my sister for christmas.  Then i saw the new slate 8 pro, had to get it.  I do not regret it one bit!  This tablet is great, with a better display than the ipad mini!  The 1980x1200 display is crisp and sharp.  The tegra 4 processor is smooth and fast.  I even downloaded a few nvidia tegra 4 games for testing and they all run smooth as butter.  Not to mention it currently is running the android 4.2.2 jelly bean operating system, with updates eventually to android 4.4 kitkat HOPEFULLY!!!!!!I am very impressed with the whole package on this tablet.  In the past 5 years i have owned over a dozen tablets, and this is one of my favorites. It ranks in the top three along with the acer a700 and the a1-810, the acer a1 is in the mix because of its quad cores and it was so awesome for such a cheap price.In the end, i highly recommend this tablet, from my experience, you would be hard pressed to find another high end 8 inch tabletI love the 8\" 4:3 aspect ratio on tablets.  It makes viewing web pages perfect, especially at this size. I also have the 8 inch lenovo yoga but its just too difficult to view webpages on such a thin viewing screen.The miracast wifi direct works great, it connected to my lenovo wd100 dongle on the first try, without any issues at all.  It also connected flawlessly via bluetooth to my new hardon karmon bluetooth over the ear headphones.You also get 25gb of cloud storage for free via box, curtousy of hp, it also works great.  The cloud storage via acer cloud works great too.  Sound is really great with the included beats audio.No problems connecting at all via wi-fi, it connects via dual bands at 2.4ghz and at 5ghz without any issues whatsoever.The tablet also has an hdmi port, even though most sites dont even list it as a available port.  I like the way hp  enclosed the sd card slot also, just seems to keep it safer from dust and debree.  I also like the way the volume rocker is flush with the back so there isnt any accidental pressing...same as the power button too.The slate 8 also has an included internal app for controlling the processor speed and power.  There are three levels, maximum, balanced and power saver, on the power saver mode the processor only utilizes only 2 of the 4 available processors.  On balanced it uses all four but limits the frames per second and at maximum it uses all 4 and lifts the frames per second limit.  If you arent playing games or multi-tasking i have found that cutting back on the processor really saves your battery.I do agree that the speakers would be better seperated on each side, not together as they are, when using tablet face up the speakers are both on bottom, but when you turn the tablet on its side both speakers are located on the right.  But they do have really good sound for an 8 inch tablet.  I dont use them that often though because i usually have bluetooth headphones on or have it connected to one of my soundfreaq sound step speakers i have situated throughout my house.The hp brand case works real nice, but it does collect dirt real easy.  I havent purchased the docking station for the slate line yet, i will ad to this feedback when i do.Overall i really enjoy this tablet and feel that for the most part,hp did an excellent job.  I really hope they give it the kitkat update. I was buying acer tablets but quite that because they never gave any of their tablets any decent updates.  They did with earlier/oldr models but not on any of their newer tabs.  So now i am giving hp a chance, and from the looks of this tablet, i am glad i did.In the end, i highly recommend this tablet, from my experience, you would be hard pressed to find another high end 8 inch tablet with these specs at this price, that runs this smoothly, and from a name like hp.  My amd a10 quad core gaming laptop is an hp, but my all in one is an acer. Those are currently my 2 favorite brands.Sorryif my review is a little jumbled and short in areas, currently i am writing this while exercising on my stationary bike and watching supernatural on tv....lol.  guess my resolution this year was to multi-task more, lol.  If you are thinking about buying this tablet, do it, i guarantee you wont regret it!  Good luck....and happy shopping!P.S. when you first setup you new tablet you might find a few apps that seem to run a little slow, don't fret. This happens with all new tablets, it usually takes a few months for them to get the bugs out of their new model. It's normal, it even happens with the way over priced apple products.

It does everything I need it to do and more.I endorse this tablet as a 5 stars out of 5 stars.Go to this HP website for all the specs and descriptions.You will be pleased with this tablet.[...]"],["Long and the short,  I ended up returning this for the simple reason that there are many apps that aren't &#34;compatible&#34; with this tablet. When you first boot it up, you're prompted to install an update to the &#34;latest&#34; version of Android - in this case 4.2.2. After a quick reboot and the obligatory setup steps, you're greeted with a mostly stock Android experience. This was a huge selling point for me as I can't stand Samsung's UI. Unfortunately, as soon as the Play Store automagically finished installing all my apps that I normally install (recovering from my Google account linked to other Android tablets), I noticed I was missing several apps. Most notably, KINDLE. I use Amazon's Kindle app on Android devices for e-reading, and the fact that it says, &#34;This app is not compatible with your device&#34; on the Play Store's page for it, is just a complete deal breaker. I went onto the XDA-Developers forums to see if there was a root guide or anything at all to help solve this problem, but it's evidently not a popular tablet as it doesn't even have a dedicated sub-forum.Performance is okay. Despite what I read about nVidia Tegra in the reviews, it always seems like a slug when I use devices with it. Compared to a Snapdragon 800, which doesn't skip a beat on any of the animations or transitions, and renders web content fluidly...the Tegra chip seems to stutter just about everywhere. I don't game much on my tablets, so I don't really know if perhaps it has some optimizations in that category or not.Build quality on the other hand seems fantastic. The plastic back feels nice to hold, and the tapered edges are a great style. Unfortunately on the note of style, HP seems to have borrowed from their PC division and slapped a giant unsightly sticker on the back with random serial numbers and other unimportant information. It reminds me of PCs that have Intel and AMD stickers all over them - Just so that you know what kind of processor and graphics chip it uses. You know, as if anyone cared about details like those being that it's 2014 and all...The biggest selling point is the 4:3 aspect ratio. Apple just has this nailed down. I was excited to see an Android device that was basically the same as the iPad mini. Unfortunately, HP still has a long way to go."],["Can't believe no one has noticed this, fast, nice screen, aspect ratio is much better than 16:9, it is a bit too long and narrow when holding in portrait"],["Pros: Good specs, nice 4:3 aspect ratio in comparison to similar sized tabletsCons: Feels unwieldy, hard to feel/find power and volume controls, bad speaker location (bottom), limited 1 GB memoryI got the Slate 8 Pro for Christmas (from another retailer) because of the 4:3 aspect ratio, 1600 x 1200 pixels, Tegra 4 chipset, separate micro HDMI port, and portability. The specs were great, the screen looked bright and colorful and the system seemed snappy. The rear camera took good pictures from the few I took. I didn't try the front camera.I didn't like some aspects of the device, so I returned it. It felt a little dense and heavy in my medium sized hands, probably due to the relatively large bezels at the top and bottom making it longer and causing the weight to be unbalanced.The speakers sounded good, but I felt they should get a little louder. Sometimes I like to lie down with the tablet on my stomach. That blocks the bottom firing speakers for the occasional YouTube video I watch in the same position (same applies to iPad Mini). What I especially didn't like was the volume control. The control is on the right side of the tablet towards the back and flush with the sides. It was therefore not so easy to find without looking if holding the tablet with one hand. HP should have put a bump on the control (including the power button) to make it easier to find. I could do it using some glue, but I shouldn't have to risk damaging the tablet if HP did better user testing.I use tablets mainly for reading, so I compared it to my 10.1\" Asus Transformer TF101 (1280 x 800 pixels, 16:10 aspect ratio). Even though the HP 4:3 aspect ratio seems good for reading, I noticed little difference in the amount of text I could see with both in portrait mode with the same relative font size using the Safari Books app. Also, the Google News web site appeared similar on both in portrait mode, despite the supposedly better HP 4:3 aspect ratio.  I suppose if I had a 16:10 aspect 8\" tablet for comparison, then the 4:3 aspect ratio would be better to see more information.I use an app called Droid 48, which emulates an HP 48 calculator. It looks fine on the Asus TF101, but not so good on the Slate 8.  The labels were off and mismatched on the keys. I didn't see the problem on other apps I used, however. I suspect this particular app did not scale properly because it occupied the entire screen and was probably built more for the 16:10 aspect ratio.Another aspect was the memory. Running apps I normally use, I frequently saw around 300 MB of memory free out of 1 GB. That wouldn't be a problem because I don't play games, but may be a problem for others who play intensive games on the tablet, given its specs. It's easy enough to close apps and clear memory, but then you'd expect to have more memory in a premium device.I think this is a good attempt by HP to make a premium device. Their next iteration should make this the one to get."],["Pros: 8 inches (I can still hold it in one hand), 4x3 screen size ratio (great for Web, e-mail, gaming, photos), bright and crisp display, great sound, long battery life, low battery drain in idle mode, high performance, loaded with features (SD card, GPS, sensors).Cons: no upgrade path to Android 4.4, lack of accessories (decent and affordable covers), so-so camera (personally I don't care about it).I have this tablet for 6 weeks, and I love it! It has the same screen size as iPad mini. Actually that was my main motive for buying the device. I was looking for something which would be slightly bigger than 7 inch (which I find too small) and yet smaller (and lighter) than 10 inch tablets. Personally, I'm not really excited with the current trend of optimizing display geometry for watching wide screen movies. This is not what most people do with the tablets. If you want to watch a movie you'd better relax and seat in front of a large TV. I guess Apple realized this long time ago. I'm still surprised why other manufactures are too slow to realize what Apple did long time ago when it introduced the first version of iPad.I put 5 stars for the tablet because I don't think those 'cons' I've mentioned earlier are too significant."],["I wanted to upgrade my old Galaxy Tab 10.1 as I wanted a better screen resolution and a faster processor.  My main use for a tablet is web surfing, emails, some remoting in to my desktop (work and home) and reading books.I looked at getting the new Galaxy Tab 10.1 however at $549 for 16GB I was not too thrilled with the cost even though it offered a lot of features, most of which I would not use however.So after reading review after review and checking specs on different tablets I decided to try this one.  I could not be happier with my decision.  The screen resolution of 1600x1200 is an improvement over the 1200x800 I had with my old tablet.  The Tegra 4 processor runs extremely well and the battery life is excellent.  Easily getting over 10 hours of use in a day.  The audio is a bit strange coming out of just one side if you are viewing something in landscape mode, but I normally use headphones so it does not bother me.  I can hold the tablet easily with one hand and the build quality feels very solid.The only issue I have had was trying to get the Kindle app to load.  I was told that it was not supported on the version of Android I have (4.2.2 is what loads after it updates) so I just side loaded the application as I got tired of waiting on Amazon to update it and it works fine."],["The product seems to be everything it promised."],["My main drive for purchasing this tablet was the price and the favorable reviews here and in some other sites.

This is very convenient for business use.- Great screen resolution- Great colors on the screen- Very fast response and performance- Nice design, specially the white backNot so good:- A bit old Android version with no news of update (if ever)- The bezel seems a bit too thick on top and bottom making the tablet slightly oversize- The OTG (acceptance of an external USB memory stick using a special third-party cable) does not work with the included HP File Manager. It works with ES File Explorer that is free to download.- Because of the size it is next to impossible to get a case. I found as a temporary solution a padded mailer sleeve intended for half letter size. It fits great.In short I consider it a great purchase."],["I am not a fan of tablets but I needed something compact to take on a trip overseas.  This is a very nice tablet and easy to use.  The only weakness I have experienced so far is that you can't get too far away from your wifi source.

Great things come in  little packages.  What a fair price!. For having it for less than 2 weeks I feel very comfortable with my Slate 8 Pro"],["I just got mine over the weekend.  As others have noted, this is a super deal for under $200.  The specs are similar to the Nexus 7, but with a bigger screen that is very easy to read. I use mine for books, magazines, and surfing, and they all look fantastic on this device.The screen is very bright and readable with no visible pixelation.  Viewing angles are fantastic with no dimming or blurring.  Movies ripped from DVD are letterboxed with the default video player.  On a small screen, the letter boxing is quite obvious and the movie seems a bit small.  Perhaps I will try a different player.Games so far seem to play without a hitch.  Lego Technic racing game looks smooth with lots of nicely rendered scenes.  Not sure how this compares to other graphically intense games.  That's not the primary use for me.Switching between apps seems very responsive, and I have not had any issues with the touch screen.The build quality is top notch.  Much higher than most Android tablets I have seen.  I love the HDMI out feature.  The SD card slot is not a big deal if you load the card once and leave it in, or transfer files to the tablet over USB instead of removing the card frequently.Compared to other 8&#34; tablets, this might seem slightly heavy, but it seems reasonable for the size.  Holding the tablet for reading or surfing is comfortable for me.  There is quite a large bezel on the tablet, which seems like wasted space.Only downside so far is the lack of 3rd party cases.  There are few choices in the 8&#34; category and the ones that I found are all a bit too small.Overall, I am very happy with my purchase, especially for the price.

What attracted me to this device was the fast Tegra 4 processor, SD expandability, high quality screen (high pixel density and viewing angle), and the 4x3 aspect ratio.  This IMHO 4x3 is a much better option for screens 10&#34; and smaller.  These units are specified as having good battery life as well.My experience with two units (which are both being returned) is that if the units did not have hardware (or perhaps firmware) problems they would be quite nice.  I would have given them a 4+ star rating.My first unit had sleep/resume issues where it would run the battery down in 15 hours during sleep or not wake up without restart.  My second unit has wifi issues where it would constantly drop wifi connections causing applications to stutter.  Every application did this.  The first unit with the sleep issues was really fast with internet connectivity.  Power settings were all the same across both units.  There is not much user supplied information about the Slate 8 Pro, but I did see both issues mentioned as hardware/firmware related on the HP Slate 7.Its quite disappointing because these units are very close Android equivalents to the IOS based iPad Mini Retina.  Leaving the whole IOS/Android issue aside (and I fully recognize for many any comparison ends here because they see this as &#34;apples and oranges&#34;), the iPad Mini Retina has a smaller size (narrower bezels) but this Slate 8 Pro has SD expandability and a standard Power and HDMI (mini) port.  Both have magnetic activated sleep and resume.Not HP's fault but an Android issue is the use of valuable screen real-estate for nav icons.  IOS and some other Android platform manufacturers use hardware buttons and/or bezel digitizers for this.  With the width of the HP bezels it would have been nice to have some off screen controls rather than loosing a band of screen to nav icons.  This is especially an issue when in Landscape orientation.  Many phones have this issue, but some use off screen icons.  I like the IOS device hardware button personally.  It would have been nice if HP implemented something similar.Overall a missed opportunity to produce a really fine device at a good price point (especially with respect to IOS devices with similar screen sizes).  I will not be buying another 8&#34; android device because I really don't like 16x9, 8&#34; screens and 4x3 is not common on a high quality device in Android.  I would like 4x3, high PPI, Tegra 4 or similar, GPS, magnetic sleep/resume, 2GB RAM SD expansion and at least 16GB built in Flash.

Highly dissappointed in  HP's quality control (lack there off)  at this time,  It's a potentially beautiful tablet if only I can get one that doesn't have all of these quality and system failure issues.  I'm only giving HP this many chances because of the tablets  beats by Dre sound technology and it's Full HD display and above all 4:3 aspect ratio.

It has lots of flexibility with the option of additional memory on a micro SD card. It is a bit more of a thicker heavier slab than I was accustomed to with the iPad Mini Retina and with the Nexus 7.As far as the OS goes, it is a fairly stock Android. There are some HP apps, and it is not 4.4.4.4, but it isn't nearly as customized and &#34;junked up&#34; as I have seen on the latest Samsung I had, which was the Galaxy Note 2014.One oddity I found so far was that is is charger sensitive-- most phones & tablets these days can use a variety of inputs from the most common chargers, and my favorite is the 15 Watt Powerfast charger from Amazon. This one wouldn't charge on it, nor did it tell me it wasn't charging. It showed a charging screen for a moment, then no other message. I found that it works just fine on iPhone chargers and of course, the charger it comes with. In a world where we carry around 5-10 devices that need charged, I wasn't so thrilled that this one is picky on the charger.I plan to spend a lot more time with the tablet and update later.

Makes it a bit tough to adjust while in a case even tho there is a cut out design in the case for this.

Colored black like the D90, comes with eyepiece protector and top panel LCD protector too. I'd read things about how the Nikon cover was prone to getting scratches and breaking, so I figured why not, I spent 900 on a camera, another 15 won't be bad.You get what you pay for indeed. Maybe even more.The LCD cover is very good. It actually resists smudges from my face pressed against the LCD. It's very clear and doesn't reflect light. In darkness it will reflect your image, but once the screen is turned on the reflection is gone.The top panel LCD protector is actually a thin piece of glass. The back is lined with adhesive (3M Brand) and you stick it right onto the top panel. Fits perfectly. I can't even tell it's there unless I look on the side and notice the thin piece of glass raised up.The eyepiece protector is actually not bad. I haven't gotten any reflective problems with that. I can still see very clearly through it. I figured it would make things fuzzy but it's still sharp inside the viewfinder.Note: The eyepiece protector is attached to the actual rubber eyepiece part. You can detach the rubber eyepiece from camera by pushing up on the rubber and it will pop out. Then you can apply the eyepiece protector onto that. It's attached to the rubber eyepiece itself because the only other real reason why you'd take it off is for when you need to cover the eyepiece using that other eyepiece cover thing.Overall, I'm pleased at the quality of this product. I was expecting flimsy plastic, to be honest, but instead I got some nice quality thin glass that will protect my LCDs from harm for a long time."],["Don't give it anymore thought, just buy it! I am very, very happy with the screen protector. Nikon should contract with these guys and supply them with the camera out of the box. It keeps annoying dust from getting between the protector and screen, the optical glass makes for a very clear bright image, resists scratching, wipes clean easy!

I am just an amateur photographer and always looking for ways to improve my shots. Since its the holidays, my main focus has been Christmas decorations. The added impact that the stars give, makes my shots feel more festive and the rainbow effect emulating from the rays gives me that added emphases that I have been looking for.I was so excited when I received my filter that I don't think I even looked to see if there was any instructions enclosed. As of today, I haven't seen any, but really don't feel as though it's necessary since you just screw it on your lens and shoot.Everything shipped well.

It fits perfectly, and does what it says it will do very nicely."],["The filter works as specified, so for that, I give it the full five stars.I will point out, though, that this isn't a filter I use a lot.  I find it most useful for night shots, and generally when there are several street lamps.  The effect can be very potent.  However, the effect can be very cloying, too.  I might post one starburst shot in fifty.  However, when used sparingly, the effect can be dramatic.My biggest mistake is forgetting that I have it.  I think back to a fountain shot that I took in Savannah, and I regret not bringing it out.  I had it with me, but I was concentrating on other stuff."],["Nice 8 point star filter with nice little stars.

It's an easy addition to my photography arsenal. It doesn't take up much space and it helps me to dress up my photography a little by adding a cool starburst effect when photographing shiny objects. I love using this filter when photographing the jewelry I create."],["What a great asset to my camera when I am shooting night scenes. It just brings out the depth and gives a terrific feeling to the shot. Fast service and great price"],["Filters such as this NEEWER 52MM Cross Screen Twinkle Effect Lens Filter can add a spectacular effect to your photos, especially ones that you may wish to use for sharing of holiday photos. This particular one can be use with any camera lens with a 52mm filter thread, though it's available in many different sizes if you look. Simply, it splits strong lights or reflections into eight spikes and can make for some spectacular photos... if not overused. But let's look the key points regarding this particular filter.Pros:* Rotating ring; filter rotates like a polarizer for exact positioning* Creates sharp 8-point star \"twinkle\" effects* Can be used in combination with other filters for creativity; mount the star as the outermost filter* Metal mounting ring; some others have plastic mounting rings* Can be used with either color or b&w; images (see the photos)* Excellent price... a bargainCons:* Filter is plexiglass; take extra care when cleaningThis filter is most effective with night shooting or special holiday occasions like Christmas and such. It can be very effective shooting where there are several street lamps, and it can be dazzling, but it can be overused as well. Sharing one star effect image out of a series of ten or more can be dramatic, but overdo it and it can be quickly boring to your audience. Used sparingly, the star effect can be quite dramatic. See the images that I've posted here and you'll see that it can be a good creative tool.Simple recommendations:Special effects tools like star filters can create nice patterns, and can be pretty exciting at first. But if you use them ten times during one holiday shooting session, you'll quickly feel tired of them, as will your audience. Try out your star filter, but always take a version without such one. Also, take care of the surface when using this filter. It's made of plexiglass or some such material, and the surface will scratch easily if you just wipe it off. Use a decent liquid lens cleaning solution with a proper lens cloth and you should have no problems with it lasting.Overall I would rate this 8-point filter as a 3-star choice, maybe as 4-stars, and that's because of a personal bias towards filters made of good quality optical glass. However since this is a secondary filter used only for special effects, I'll call it a 5-star recommendation, as it works well and the price is excellent.3/28/2012"],["The Star filter was really cheap and you can see that in the way the star looks like, but it is okay for the price"],["Considering the price of this filter is ridiculously cheap, the quality is good.

It arrived fully assembled (no installing flash tubes and/or modeling blubs) with sync cable and instructions. The strobe and mounting handle feel sturdy enough for light to medium use. The modeling lamp output varies with the power setting and runs hot within a few minutes. I would suggest use it to find your shadows and turn it off. Although I didn't bother to test this, the \"stepless\" power control seems to give off light closer to 1/4 to 1/5 settings. The strobe gives off a slightly cool, which I like, colored light, but this is stated in the products info under \"Color temp\". On mine the Optical Pre-flash function doesn't work well, but I don't mind this because I use radio triggers. I mostly use this with a 43\" silver reflective umbrella and like the results. I've only had this for 2-3 weeks now, so I can't speak to the durability of the strobe, but can say I've used it for about 100 to 125 shots now and so far all is well. I can recommend this to the beginner as a low cost way into strobe/studio lighting or the more advanced as a hair/rim/backdrop light. Just remember, on mine, it gives off a slightly cool light color. But as much as anything else, its a $62.00 strobe.Update:Its now about 3 years since I bought this and it still works great. The only thing to report is that the sync plug has gone a little temper mental with my radio triggers.

var Sony_Electronics = [{"asin":"B00FJISZFK","brand":"Sony","imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31EnojgIScL._SY300_.jpg","rating":[1,3,3,7,4],"reviews":[["This pair of Sony XBAH1 in-ear headphones is the latest in a long stream of ear buds that I've gone through in the past year or so. Either my cat ate them, I lost them, they sounded cheap (because they were cheap), or they were just plain uncomfortable to wear. This pair, however, is a winner for me.I'm not a sound junkie or an expert on audio systems, and I don't really understand what this 2-Way driver system thing is all about. However, I can say that the sound that comes through these little speakers is first rate. It is crisp and clear, and the earbuds seems to help block out other noises that might interfere with the sound. They play classical musical and rock equally well, and I can hear all the nuances of the music. They may be chunky and on the homely side (yes, I admit to liking my toys to be in fashion colors), but these in-ear headphones are definitely keepers.Also, these come with a little carrying pouch. When you're not using the headphones, just roll them up and tuck them securely away. This should definitely help keep me from losing them anytime soon (I hope), and if I keep them stored in the carrying pouch, the cat can't eat them, either. Bonus!Overall, I'm very pleased with these ear buds. They are expensive, true, but I think that their sound quality is definitely worth the investment."],["My last headphones before these were sony XB90ex, so my review will be loosely based on comparison with xb90.Firstly since I paid $50 more than xb90ex (95$) my expectations were bit high. xb90 had 16mm driver and I really liked it and the second I put h1 in my ear and pressed \"play\" I felt that they were small 9mm drivers, don't get me wrong, I didn't literally feel the size of the driver but it has somewhat thinner sound, the sound that you can tell it comes from earbuds, which wasn't the case when listening to xb90.Soundstage:xb90 had huge soundstage so the first thing that disappointed me when I tried XBA H1 was the soundstage. while it's still larger than low-priced headphones(&lt; 70$) it is nowhere as wide as xb90's (though it's better than ex310's) . On the other hand instrument separation is very good, I would say better than xb90, highs and lows don't distract each other, I think 2-way drivers have something to do with this.Bass:compared to xb90 subbass somewhat lacks, generally bass is good and high enough for me and majority of listeners but that  subwoofer feeling of xb90ex is gone. Midbass is punchy and fast, slightly better than xb90's. Overral bass is almost as good as xb90'sMids:Mids are definitely front-oriented, bright and clean.female vocal is really joy to listen. I think generally this is easiest area for IEMs to perform and there is no point to talk much about it. In one word, mids are very pleasant to listen.Highs:before burning in, highs were harsh, bright and there was sibilance, after burn-in the harshness smoothed and sibilance faded away (not completely though), in fact it got too smooth for my taste. Arguably inferior performer compared to xb90ex in this area, which had very smooth but bright treble. The good thing is that it's smooth and quality is good, it's just not bright enough for me.Amplifier:I used them on my walkman x1050 which has excellent sound quality and regardless its age it's still one of the best sounding PMPs. Since the impedance of the headphones is 40 OHM which is much higher than most earbuds (majority have 16-24 ohm) I thought amplifier would be necessary but the deference isn't that much, Even without amp these earbuds sound good. Without amp the sound is somewhat hollow though, with amp it gains some midbass and sound gets more full.Conclusion:The headphones are good but very overpriced IMO, Overall I would take xb90ex over H1 without any second thoughts, they are overall at least as good performers and much cheaper than these. I think real price of these should be $80 or at most $100 because of style (they are really attractive in terms of appearance).one more thing, the left headphone is slightly quieter than the right one but I'm the only one who notices it (difference is almost negligible) but still if there wasn't this problem I would have given 4 star rating.This review maybe was too critical, they're not bad at all, at least instrument separation and \"attack\" were excellent for the class.Thanks for reading."],["Overall the sound of these is a touch more precise than my other earbuds, but the bass seems a little weak, even with the equalizer boosting the bass.  Additionally, to me, spoken word sounds a bit tinny, even with treble reduced.  (I think I need to try the replacement ear cushions that another reviewer has recommended to improve the bass response).  Compared to thePanasonic RPTCM125K(which I had recently purchased after the WireCutter rated them the best cheap earbuds) these definitely have slightly better sound overall, but only slightly better.However, there are some nice touches in this model which make them easier to use, and may lead to longer life.  For example, it is quick to determine which bud goes in which ear, because there is a subtle red band of metal on the right bud, and a little bump you can feel on the left bud.  With other earbuds I'm always checking.  Additionally, the cord feels thicker, and is more of a flat ribbon shape, so hopefully the cord is better reinforced and will last longer (I will update when it finally fails)."],["I thought the sound was okay on these.  As usual, there isn't enough bass, but the sound was good.  I think these are way overpriced for the sound quality.  The sound was good, but it wasn't excellent.  They come with a nice carrying case, which is better then most that I have seen.  If you are looking for a quality earbud for a decent price, I would suggest continuing to shop around.  If the price was lower on these, I would give them 5 stars."],["UPDATE: My original review dealt with poor bass response. I have since discovered that the cause is the included earbud tips. I swapped them out for the Comply TSX-200 earbud tips (see my review there) and suddenly WOW! I can't believe the richness of the sound, and in particular the clarity of bass notes. Perhaps the best example I can find is \"angels\" by the Xx. Mind blowing. I can't wait to listen to everything on these phones with the Comply tips.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I should preface this by saying that I am definitely not an \"audiophile.\" I don't really know how to interpret the specs of this device, and I don't really care. I wanted to try out nice headphones after using cheap ones, and I had a rewards program that offered these ones for around the number of points that I had.I have mostly been testing them in my iPhone 4S, although I also evaluated them on an iPad 2 and a 2012 Macbook Air. I tested the medium and large earbud covers, in both the all-silicone and foam/silicone variants.The first thing I noticed was that Lana del Rey sounded like she was singing right in the room with me. The second thing I noticed: \"hey, where's the bass?\"For pop music, dance, dub, electronic, you'll be left wanting. Everything will sound so crystal clear--and yet. It's like when you go to a high end restaurant and everything is just so, but you're still hungry and you get home and eat cheez-its.I'm sure the audiophiles will jump on me for this. I'm not looking something to shake my bowels, but I do want the bass line to jump. \"Angels and Saints at Ephesus\" sounds totally sublime, like I'm standing right in a chapel. I can close my eyes and see the stained glass. But if I want to pump some sick electronic beats--well, I'm going to settle for beats that are mildly dyspeptic. (Sorry.)I know I probably shouldn't expect truly good bass on a pair of earbuds, but these guys are billed as having \"extended\" bass. (Extended from what, I wonder?)If you listen to a lot of acoustic vocals or low-fi, you might really love these guys. If you want Ellie Goulding to get your feet moving, look elsewhere."],["Sony XBAH1 HeadphonesThese come with foam-lined earbuds as well as standard silicone earbuds. The super small size is only available with the standard silicone earbuds, but I found they are still too big for my ear canals. The foam lined buds are a great idea, but still too big for my ear canals and tend to fall out when jostled. As a result, there is no bass response from these headphones as there is too much of a gap between the ears and these buds. The sound quality is very tinny, as if you turned the high frequency response way up and cut out the low and mid-range frequency response.The spring loaded clip fell apart the first time I tried to use it. I believe there is a design flaw that allows the clip to separate very easily, causing the spring to fly out. The included cord manager is very simple and innovative though. I like using this because I won&#8217;t get tangled with long cords, but can still increase the length if necessary.The electrical cords are a great design. The flat design makes them feel stronger, while the areas where the cord interfaces with the connector or earbuds is reinforced with sleeves to provide additional support for improved durability. I&#8217;ve had numerous headphone wires deteriorate at these flex points.Overall: 4/5 stars, nothing really innovative about the sound quality. I prefer over the ear headphones for better audio quality and noise isolation."],["I should begin by saying that I didn't check the price on these in-ear headphones before selecting them as a Vine product. Because I have been using $20 earbuds for years, I don't feel quite qualified to make comparisons to other products in this price category. (The Sony website price for this product is $148; right now they are $86 on Amazon.)That said, even though not an audiophile, I am a trained pianist with a sensitive ear. And I've been very impressed with the difference between this product and other, cheaper products I have used. I would have kept them to myself if my husband didn't have more occasion to use and enjoy them.My husband uses earphones more often--listening to music as well as audiobooks on his train-commute daily and on bike rides.  (He also has larger ears, so this set fits his ear more comfortably than it does my small ear canal.)He is absolutely thrilled with this set, finding excellent isolation, detailed sound, clear separation of instruments, and other qualities you'd expect in upscale headphones."],["The Sony XBAH1 Hybrid 2-Way Driver In-Ear Headphones are a decently-made set of earphones (or IEMS) for the price, which has currently dropped a bit under $100.  But due to their treble-heavy sound I can't recommend these at all.Build and fit - good.  The XBAH1s seem to be well constructed of plastic, and they come with a long 48\" flat cord that seems resistant to tangling.  A small fabric carrying pouch is included, along with a selection of silicon ear tips.  (Note that I almost always toss the included tips and use a set of Comply foam tips.)  My only complaint is that these are built similarly to other Sony earphones, and stick way out of your ears.  I much prefer either a smaller overall size or a style like theCreative Aurvana 3 In-Ear Headphonesthat is designed to not stick out so much.Sound - too much treble (and I like treble).  The bass is the best part of these - if you prefer you bass to be accurate and not boomy.  It reaches down to 30 Hz or so before tailing off, and is not unnaturally emphasized like so many headphones these days.  These will not appeal to bassheads, but are good for those seeking accurate bass.  Sadly the treble is not accurate, but is really pushed up around 4.5 KHz, creating a rather uncomfortable mid-treble heavy sound.  I also noticed that the treble tailed off quickly after 8 KHz or so, so the high treble is lacking somewhat.  I typically enjoy a bit of treble \"sizzle\", but the mid-treble emphasis here just became tiring after a while.Conclusion - well constructed earphones, good accurate bass, but too much treble.  For my listening tastes I prefer the UE 700 (now discontinued) or the Aurvana set (not perfect, but better than the XBAH1) mentioned above."],["Being not an audiophile but still having a good sensitivity to musical tones, I am enjoying these in-ear headphones for the the great overall immersive sound experience including mid-tones, and bass. For music these have really worked well and are good for listening to movies, in case if you ever watch videos over iPad and iPhone.The in-ear fit is pretty good and they come with a clamp, and a plastic piece on which you can wrap them around. And obviously the wire is flat to avoid tangling unlike the Apple EarPods.The included case is very good and thankfully has no zipper, but a flap pocket. Hence it is easy to take them out from one hand.....big deal? Yes it can be sometimes !For the price, i found them to be a bit expensive. The sound quality is kind of comparable to Monster DNA in-ear or Monster Nergy, but the price is almost twice. In this price range, I'd expect a few more features like play/pause button, etc."],["I liked the comfort and fit of these headphones. The sound quality is OK, but I expected something a bit better at this price."],["I'm not an audiophile. I'm not willing to pay the premium prices that true audiophile gear commands, nor are my baby boomer ears capable of hearing the subtleties of music I could once discern. I've found that my needs can be met by earphones/earbuds in the $100 range, give or take. While, I got these earbuds from the Vine program, they are something that I'd now pay for.They are not perfect, though they are very good. Real bass lovers should look elsewhere. The XBAH1s have very clean and distinct bass, which is fine for me, but it is in no way enhanced. Actually, that's a pretty good description of how these things deliver music. The entire frequency range is very clear and crisp without any particular range emphasized. I'd say that they are similar to my favorite over the ear headphones the Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone, which are used for studio monitors and have a very flat frequency response. This makes them very nice for a wide range of music. Classical and jazz are great on the XBAH1s, as are well produced vocals of sufficient audio quality. Having such clear sound reproduction makes low quality MP3 recordings sound pretty awful. Unlike some earphones that offer such clear treble and become fatiguing after a while, these are very listenable, though I wouldn't call the sound in any way warm.I don't like the foam filled silicone covers. The foam makes them too stiff for extended comfort and the silicone doesn't allow the foam to fully conform to my ear channels. Others have recommended the Comply TSX-200 earbud tips. I had a pair of Comply Tx tips in a drawer, I think the 200, that I tried and which make the XBAH1s very comfortable. Bottom line, very good earbuds with mediocre tips."],["My first IEM were the Sony MDR-EX300 and man they were great. I've had it for a while until it was recently stolen and I was in the market for new IEMs. After doing a lot of research and the price drop, I decided to jump on these, and I do not regret my purchase. Now, I am no audiophile by any means but hopefully, this review will help you on picking some decent headphones.Design:I really like the red/black color scheme. The cable is Y-shaped, versus the annoying J-shape that many Sony headphones, including my old EX300, come with. The cable is flat and tangle resistant. You can roll up the headphones and put it in the included pouch, take it out, and it won't have that wire memory that some of the round cables have. I feel that the design of the cable also reduces the microphonics. They also include a shirt clip to reduce it even more, especially when you are exercising. The actual casing or body of the headphones is made of plastic, but stylish.Fit:It comes with two sets of tips, both are the silicone hybrid tips, but one has foam and one doesn't. I tried the one with the foam and I didn't really like the fit/isolation. It just felt a little weird for me and I couldn't get a real good seal. The normal silicone tips worked a lot better for me, but it could be because I am used to wearing the normal one with my EX300. I read some reviews that the Comply tips make it even better, so I gave it a shot. I could definitely tell a difference, so see below on the sound quality. The casing is a little bit bigger than most IEMs, and kind of sticks out of your ear, but it doesn't feel heavy when you are wearing it. I don't feel fatigued after wearing it all day long at work.Sound:So, once you get a good seal and have had some burn-in time with these, the headphones really shine. The comply tips definitely make a difference and brings out the sound more on these headphones. The bass is very controlled and prominent, but not super thumpy (if that is a word). It doesn't overwhelm the mids or highs and blends in with the music very well. The best part of these headphones are the mids. Mids are very crisp and clear. I really love how well these headphones do with vocals and instrumentals. It sounds bright and forward. I would say the highs is where these headphones are the weakest. I would say they were pretty harsh at the start, but after burn-in, it smoothed out. The quality is good but it isn't as crisp. The soundstage is pretty good. It sounds like you are at a concert and the singer or band is playing at you. The instrument separation is excellent, and you can definitely hear the different layers.Overall, for $99, it isn't a bad price for an excellent pair of IEMs. If I can describe these headphones in one word, I would say it sounds &#34;fun&#34;. Definitely consider the comply tips because I think it helps out these headphones a lot. It is a great set for someone who is looking for some entry level quality headphones."],["I am rather disappointed with this iteration of the XBA series. IMO, the H1 is to the EX600 as the H3 is to the EX1000 (similar price and similar place in the line up). But while the EX600 was an excellent value budget entry that shared a lot of the pros of the flagship EX1000, the H1 just does not cut it as a sensible buy.The XBA-H1 is expensive given its sound. While it sounds decent, it pales in comparison with the XBA-H3, and many other IEMS in the price range can offer better comfort or sound or a combination of both.COMFORT:First, to get any reasonable sound production, you have to mess around with the tips and experiment with all sizes. This was true with the EX600-1000 line, the general shape and design of which the H1-H3 line is modeled after. It is disappointing that Sony has made zero improvement to fit and sound since the release of the EX line years ago. You get the same shape, same tips, same awkward ergonomics.If you have owned the EX600 or 1000 and did not enjoy it fit, then you likely won't like the H1 H2 or H3.SOUND:These sound decent. It is not that they sound bad, per se. It is just that the H1 sounds exactly as you would expect the cheapest offering of the XBA-H line would offer. For example, I think the XBA-1 sounds very decent for its $23 price tag and would recommend those to anyone. So basically, the XBA-H1 is like the XBA-1, but costing 7 times the price.I bought the H3 and H1 to compare. I was expecting miracles with the H1. Its got decent specs and features - you still get to experience the hybrid technology with 1 dynamic driver plus 1 balanced armature. And the EX600 that came before was the same price range ($149 but gone down to $129 for a while), and sounded very good compared to the flagship EX1000. I was expecting the H1 to still sound very good when I A-B compare it against the H3.This was not the case with the H1. With all the hype of dynamic + BA hybrid IEMs, and that I generally liked Sony's in-house designed BAs that were used in the original XBA line, I thought the H1 was going to be a great value at $150, that would destroy all other IEMs in the $150 price range. It simply isn't. I would by these at about $70 - taken into account of its build quality, ergonomics, and sound.I digress. Back onto sound: there is good detail and good dynamics with the sound. But it sounds hollow and disjointed. It sounds like it is missing 2 additional BA drivers. It does not sound lean or analytical - I would've been fine with that. I love my single BA ER4PT. But the H1, it just sounds...lacking. Every time I used them, I felt like they were saying &#34;you should've bought the H3&#34; - that is the sound they make. And I am glad to have bought the H3 so haha to the H1s.I am peculiar about ergonomics. I would choose the XBA-1 over XBA 3 or 4 simply because the 1 is lighter, easier to wear, and more comfortable over longer listening periods. HOWEVER, the XBAH1 is where I would rather listen to the heavier, bulkier, less comfortable XBAH3 than the H1.It is obvious Sony's effort was put on the XBA H3s. Only afterwards, they thought &#34;we've already swallowed the R&D; costs, so we should make a H1 and H2 version that are cheaper so more customers can pay us money.&#34;"],["This review is solely for the Sony XBAH1 Hybrid 2-Way Driver In-Ear Headphones since they are the only new generation headphones I've tested. I've relied on Sony quality/price over the past years in finding good quality audio headphones without breaking the bank. I wanted to replace my EX300s that have not failed me in sound and durability for the past 5 years now.I was expecting the XBAH1s to blow my EX300 away but I was disappointed. The XBAH1 while clearer and more refined in mids and highs, struggled with power and bass definition. I expected them to handle bass well but instead it felt under powered- like the drivers were sub-par- the bass felt fake and unnatural- no punch. My EX300 do a much better job handling power and accurate tight bass- giving you a punch but never making you feel under powered or like they will distort. I listen to all kinds of music- from classical to hip-hop to reggae and oldies and pop. I like accurate strong bass, controlled mids and clear highs. My EX300s have not disapointed me in this sense but I know they will eventually break down. In my opinion Sony made a mistake in venturing into hybrid drivers- the 13mm round drivers do an awesome job in delivering accurate power without making the bass sound unnatural and boomy- that's a complaint many listeners have on the new extra bass models they came out with earlier.I'm not sure about the new higher end models, whether they will make up for this- but i'm certainly not going to shell out $200+ to find out. I paid $59 for my EX300 a few years back and they are worth every penny. If I find another seller that has them I will buy the again because I think Sony got it right then.On another note- the XBAH1s are extremely well built- everything from the cord to the way they fit in your ear is top notch and do not feel cheap at all. Nicely built- not too light and come with various tips options.  These are a good pair of headphones don't get me wrong- but for me they came up short when comparing them with older models in the field of bass and handling of power and punch. For anyone else these could be the best headphones they've had. I hope this was helpful to those who are more audio inclined. I do not consider myself an audiophile but I know what I like."],["The XBAH1 is a really nice all-around earbud. Despite being driver-driven (haha), I didn't find it to be particularly robust in its bass delivery compared to other headphones at similar price points, but for me, this is to its credit, as I prefer a clean, uncolored sound.Obviously, these aren't going to replace true in-ear monitors, but for everyday listening, they're good. I noticed especially clean sound separation when listening to various kinds of electronic- and synth-heavy music. Rock stuff sounded fine, as well, though perhaps just a bit sludgy, depending on one's tastes. Concert music came through like a bell- clear and clean.The design is first-rate. They look sharp, are very comfortable, the buds have a bit of size and weight to them that I prefer (lighter ones fall out of my ears), and the cord is sturdy and doesn't tend to tangle.I've read in other reviews that certain brands of third-party tips improve the bass performance, so if you're looking for that, check those out.For all-purpose headphones, these are very nice, and at the lower price point, I feel they represent a good value."],["Sound is very high quality. Good highs and decent lows, these actually compare up to over ear phones. The 2 driver does have a different sound if that's something you're looking forward to. Build quality is nice. Also includes different ear size tips so you can find a good fit/seal. The only con is maybe it is long sideways and may stick out your ears where some people might not like the looks of it. Otherwise sound is def high quality."],["These are a great pair of headphones with excellent sound quality and a durable cord. The bass is rich and clear. The included accessories I am on the fence about. Here's why:The included cord clip and cord adjuster are hate or love. I personally found them to be in the way. I can see how they would work well if you are at the gym or if your mp3 player is in a schoolbag. But just for leisure listening at home, I don't find them useful.The bag is a nice material and provides padding. I only wish the closure was a zipper, and not a fold over flap.Aside from the points I mentioned, I do like these headphones. There are quite a few included ear buds which make for a custom fit. Even though I don't use the accessories, these are still one of my favorite pairs of headphones. Highly recommended!"],["I'm actually writing this like at 1 am waiting for tomorrow to go return these at best buy wow these are garbage again garbage they sound tiny no freaking Nass just utter garbage and there bulky they sit on your ear instead of going nice and snug into your ear canal waste of time not money I kept the recite"]],"title":"Sony XBAH1 Hybrid 2-Way Driver In-Ear Headphones","total_reviews":18,"sentiment":0.9445055556,"label":"positive","best_review":["I liked the comfort and fit of these headphones.

I also own the Zeiss 24mm f/1.8 (which I love) and it has no such issues, although I seem to recall reading of the \"hunt and peck\" issue with the Touit lenses as well.As background, I am using an NEX-6, I have several Canon DSLR bodies and lenses, up to the EOS-1D X and 400mm 2.8. I have the Metabones smart adapter for the NEX and use Canon lenses on the NEX-6 from time to time, everything up to and including the 400mm. Besides the Zeiss 24mm, in native E-mount I have the Sony 10-18mm f/4, the Sony 16mm f/2.8 and the Sony 35mm f/1.8. In general I bought the NEX as an \"unobtrusive carry-around\" solution (and BTW I love the NEX-6).I did update my NEX-6 firmware for this lens before the lens arrived, and I have cleaned the contacts.I timed the autofocus for this lens in \"office lighting\", which included fluorescent lights along with several large windows with ambient sunlight. Overall I guess this would be considered \"low light\" by most, but honestly I have tested a host of bodies and lenses in this same environment without much issue. And for me this fairly represents \"indoor shooting\".  Extended to 70mm (where autofocus was worst), this lens typically took between two and three seconds to lock focus on decently lit subjects. At worst (and rarely), pointing to darker areas of the room it took several more seconds. At 16mm autofocus was acceptable (not noticeably slow or fast IMO). In contrast, the 24mm Zeiss is noticeably fast in locking focus IMO.I took test shots for sharpness and vignetting and thought this lens did a very good job in those categories across a wide range from 16-70mm and differing apertures. I then took it out into bright sunlight to capture moving subjects, and while the autofocus performance was OK, I certainly was not blown away (at 70mm). Still slow by my standards. Optically however I was quite pleased with the results.As an aside, the combination of the NEX-6, Metabones adapter and Canon 135mm f/2.0 also hunts a bit for autofocus (this combo locks focus in 1-2 seconds, which I found unusable). So your perception of \"usable\" may be different than mine. If I use this combo now, I use manual focus.On the bright side, once this lens settles down to a focused shot the results are on a par quality-wise with the Zeiss 24mm. The ergonomics are pretty much superb IMO. It is just a tad wider/bigger/heavier than the 24mm (55mm filter vs. 49mm for the 24) and is not unwieldy in the hand even fully extended. The OSS works remarkably well, I was able to get steady and in-focus shots (if I braced myself a bit) down to 1/20 sec.For shooting stationary objects where focus time is not a huge consideration, this lens is really quite nice. The reasonable focusing distance of just over a foot means that close objects shot at 70mm feel like they were shot with a much wider aperture lens (tiny DOF).For my use of the NEX-6, the 16-70mm range of this lens is just about perfect for a default lens. So I am disappointed with the outcome, as I was looking forward to it being my default. And in all honesty I tried and tried to find a way to justify keeping it.It certainly could be a matter of my copy of this lens not being up to par, it could be that I am way off track, it could be that this lens is perfectly acceptable to the masses. It could be that for your usage this lens is superb - it certainly has a lot going for it.In the end however I simply could not live with the indoor autofocus performance and have decided to return it."],["I poured over the reviews for weeks.  I kept reading the criticisms that this lens was barely sharper than the kit lens.  But I finally decided it was worth a try.  Boy, am I glad I did! I am no expert photographer, so I can't tell you much about the pixel peeping details.  What I can tell you is that this lens seemed VERY sharp for a zoom lens.  But much more important to me than the overall corner to corner sharpness is the COLOR.  This lens produces much more saturated colors than the other two kit lenses.  I used the 18-55 for over a year before buying this lens, and it is a huge upgrade.  Also, I noticed this lens focuses faster than the 18-55.  I paired this lens with the a6000, and I feel like I now have a fantastic tool for taking great pics.  So far I am getting sharper, more colorful pics.  I would buy this lens again in a heartbeat."],["You always read the question &#34;Is it sharper than the kit lens?&#34;. Because for 8 times the money, you certainly can expect some superior optical performance over the cheap kit lens. And fortunately, this is exactly what you get - superior optical performance in the areas of contrast, color rendition, vignetting, and distortion. And although sharpness is not a real distinguishing factor in lens design these days anymore (the factors mentioned before are way more important and much costlier to achieve at a high level), much like the pixel count on the camera, rest assured that this lens is very sharp and provides extremely detailed pictures that are utterly crisp and have absolute stunning colors and contrast. I use this lens mostly for indoor shooting at concerts, sports events and the like and yes, sometimes I wish it was a little faster than f4, but generally it works real fine even at the necessary high ISO settings for those subjects. The constant aperture of f4 is very useful, and in my experience you need to step down the aperture to get the best results. The mechanical quality of the lens is also a cut above the rest, the zoom ring is smooth and responsive, and the whole look and feel of the lens oozes professionalism. Some reviewers commented that the lens was constantly &#34;pecking and hunting&#34;. I know what they mean, my Zeiss Touit 12mm/2.8 does this, too - but not this lens. I must have gotten a real good specimen. Since the lens is about double as long as the kit 18-55mm lens, and quite a bit heavier, I prefer to use it on my NEX-6, for added stability when pressing the camera against my forehead when using the viewfinder. But it also works on my NEX-5T, although it takes some practice to aim it and then hold it steady with two arms stretched out. That leads me to my last point I wanted to make here - the optical steady shot (OSS) lens stabilization. I own some quite expensive Nikon lenses with stabilization, and they are notoriously good at that, providing at least 4 stops of margin. This lens here I regularly use at 1/10s with most of the shots sharp, and at 1/8s with about half of the shots sharp. None of my Nikon lenses can be used hand held at those shutter speeds and generate a comparable rate of good results.So, in summary, is this lens worth the hefty price tag? In my opinion, it is worth every penny of it. I own virtually every E-mount lens there is (with the exception of the 18-200mm), and this is the best, both in regards to its useful zoom range and constant aperture, and also in regards of the superior picture quality it generates."],["My take: Nice mid-range variable zoom lens.Pixel peepers might mind an increased incidence of chromatic aberration. This lens packs higher contrast levels, if that's your thing or not. Also, this lens has a tendency to backfocus more often than the kit lens. About 60% of the shots I took on full auto had to be retaken because they were backfocused.The thing is, the CA, contrast and other little quirks of this lens on the Nex 5N/3R I found were easily correctable via Lightroom or any reliable RAW editing program. Do you think though this is worth the near $1000.00 price tag? I feel it's a little overpriced.I feel this should have been the original kit lens.. but I'm probably keeping it as I notice it has better colors than the kit lens, and it works great for video. Cheers!"],["Received the 1670z this morning and immediately attached it to my Nex 6. The lens fussed a bit at first, it wouldn't focus and made a few 'interesting' whirring noises. I took it off and cleaned the contacts with a bit of alcohol and reattached it to the camera and so far it has been behaving itself.The zoom action is very smooth but the manual focus ring is a little narrow and you don't have to turn it much to overshoot your focus, I am spoiled by the huge focus ring of the 24!Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent lens, it really feels good in the hand and is not too heavy or large. It has very good close focus and the OSS works well. In fact this lens and the 24F18 make the perfect kit, as far as i am concerned and I recommend it.I will keep an eye on any quality issues and update this review but with the contact cleaning I am hoping that only good images lie ahead.CZR11/3/13 UpdateToday I had a similar issue with a different lens on the camera. So I have to conclude that the 1670Z lens was not at fault, which actually ticks me off since it was a very sharp lens! If I could do everything over again, I would just get the Nex 6 body and this 1670 lens as it covered all my needs very well.10/6/13 UpdateAfter a second failure, I cleaned the contacts and the pins in the camera with a cotton swab and some alcohol, so far so good, have not had any problems since.Lens performs like a champ and is on par in every way with the high end CaNikon f4 zooms.  Very Pleased.10/12/13 UpdateAfter a trip to the local farmers market this morning I have started the return process, the lens failed several times and I will have to get an exchange. Too bad as this one was very sharp and I am left to wonder if the replacement will be as least as good.."],["Well, I agree with a previous reviewer of this lens, in that this one is hard to put your finger on.There are about 3 questions you need to answer Yes on if you are going to be a candidate to own one.First, 1.) Do you have a use pattern that will overlay with what this lens strengths are, and not its weaknesses ?  2.) Are you OK with winking-off purchasing an obviously over priced lens, being an early adopter with this one is paying a price that is clearly at a painful pinch-point.  3.) Do you have a good copy, as it is clear that the QA is spotty in the early production runs.I'll discuss these in turn:  The first item above is that this lens is like most of these new breed of computer designed high performance lenses. The fact is that the lens operates over such a wide range of focal lengths and ability to near focus,  that it can not help but have a lot of sweet points and contrary with those corollary sour points, so therefore performance tends to run all over the map.  It would take a large spreadsheet and someone with a lot of time to map out a lens performance chart here.  For example at infinity focus at 16mm the barrel distortion, and the edge focus issues are present, but go to 24mm and focus from 3 feet to 12 feet and you're good to go, but focus issues change and come and go with F stop changes and focal distances all across the lens range and the whole thing quickly degenerates into a grab-bag of \"what you see is what you get\".  Some time excellent Zeiss like performance but sometimes just good here, bad there, and back again in a constantly changing pattern that you quickly realize becomes either a deal killer or you can live with it.I personally can live with it, because my use is mostly a bunch of street portrait and \"document the live event\" type of candid rapid fire no-time-to-think get the shot before it disappears stuff.  You could call my use sort of  \"advanced vacation photos stuff\",  usually always daylight, high shutter speeds, and a typical afternoon  camera roll of 100 shots edits down to less than 50 \"keepers\" .. I have a bag full of great primes that I can bolt on if I need them, but here is the thing:  The great strength of this lens is it versatility and speed of use.  It's 10x faster for me to use this lens for what I do than to go to the primes.  For me with OSS and auto focus and almost always crystal sharp center areas  it beats the snot out of fooling around with switching through a bag full of primes just to get these \"candid shots\".  I want these shots, but I need much better performance than the kit lens.. Don't get me wrong, the kit lens is a smashing good deal and I have taken hundreds of \"keepers\" with it.  For $95 it is a steal.  But eventually, when looking through your last roll from the kit lens, you get that nagging hair on the back of your neck bothering you.  It tells you \"darn a great candid shot, too bad that lens not just a notch higher in quality\"So onto #2;) From the above narrative you can see that just about anyone with my shooting style would say,  sure its time to get better speed of use / performance over the kit lens.  But, what is that worth? For the last 40+ years I have bought and sold, owned and parted with so many cameras and lenses I have lost counting them.  But I never remember having to pay 1000% more than the lesser kit lens to accomplish the goal.  This is the toughest part of owing this lens. It's kind of strange, usually to a photographer, these decisions are made on a technical basis.  But here you have to make the decision based in large part on what your banker thinks of the deal.Number #3 is just the usual with any new lens you add to your bag.  Although here maybe a little more so.  I spent the first part of the afternoon when the lens arrived shooting the usual flat brick walls until I was satisfied.  My copy was \"OK\",  I think if I had a way to go through 20 of them, I could probably have selected out one or two that were better, but I think what I have in hand is about what is generally the normal for this one.  Later that afternoon,  after the brick walls were shot,  I moved on to  an afternoon of real subjects.  If it is of use to you: here is a link to the roll:  [...]  I know Amazon parses out these links so what that link is in plain text is [...]Have fun and good shooting to you !  If your banker is good with the deal my recommendation is, go ahead and buy one!"],["Pair it with the NEX7 and you have a fantastic travel camera. Great zoom range that stays sharp throughout, small and lightweight. Let me repeat that: small and leightweight. If you are traveling and do not need to lug around a lot of gear,  those become important factors. Stick to Single Shot autofocus mode. It hunts in continuous looking for something moving and it can drive you crazy. That seems to be more an issue that Sony is struggling with right now and less a lens issue. If you are photographing Formula 1 or the bulls running at Pamplona I'd go with a different camera system. Otherwise this lens really taps the potential of the NEX7 unlike any other."],["Sony actually offers four mid-range zoom lenses in e-mount, plus a zoom wide angle. The subject here are the two most common mid range zooms. This Zeiss 16-70mm zoom is Sony's effort to offer a higher quality zoom than the Sony kit 18-55mm. Both have Optical Image Stabilization. The Zeiss has a slightly longer zoom range and a constant f4 aperture at any focal length, whereas the kit lens aperture varies. While the kit lens is plastic, the Zeiss lens is built with better materials, metal barrel, precision manufacture. Of course it's image quality that counts most.To test image quality, I compared the two lenses head to head on the same view, both at f5.6, both at ISO1600, one comparison at 55mm focal length and another at 20 mm focal length. I used manual focus and a tripod and focussed separately at the corners and centers to eliminate any curvature of field. My results: At f=55mm, the Zeiss has slightly more contrast in the corner, and is a bit cleaner and sharper in the center. The differences are subtle. At f=20 mm, the Zeiss has more contrast in the corner, but both are fuzzy. In the center, the Zeiss is distinctly sharper and more contrasty. So in terms of image quality, the Zeiss is a bit cleaner and sharper than the kit lens, but the differences are minor, not night-and-day, most evident at the wide angle end. In the majority of photographs, it would be difficult to tell which lens was used.Since the Zeiss showed its advantage at wide angle, I did one more test, comparing the Zeiss zoom set at 20mm with Sony's recent 20 mm prime lens, which is very compact, f2.8 and reasonably priced. The images from these two proved hard to tell apart - equal image quality at that one focal length.Compactness is also an issue. The Zeiss is about an inch longer than the kit 18-55. A third Sony zoom is available which is collapsable, 16-50, and most compact of all. I haven't tested that one.It can't be ignored that the Zeiss costs 11X more than the 18-55 kit zoom (the kit costs only $91 more than the body for the NEX 5R); is it worth it? The Zeiss is marginally better in the various measures listed above, but can't be said to be 11X better, nor is it going to enable you to get some spectacular shot the kit zoom would not. Part of the price is a premium tacked on for the Zeiss brand name. Beyond that, technology cost generally follows a log-log power law. 90% of the state of the art costs X and 95% costs 10X, and 99% costs 100X. Amateur photographers need to decide how far to ride this curve for marginal improvements. If price matters to you, the kit lens is pretty darn good (90%) and a bargain when purchased with a NEX body. The Zeiss 16-70 is a bit nicer on all scores (95%), but you won't see any enormous difference in your photos. I was a bit offended by the high price, which I believe takes advantage of the customer who expects miracles from Zeiss.Or, if price really doesn't matter to you and you need the very highest quality available, consider the 99% end of the range; the Zeiss CZ.2 e-mount 28-80 zoom lens is made for the professional cinema industry and sells for $19,900. Amazon, please send me one and I will test it!"],["I have had this lens for about two weeks and have shot hundreds of photos in various conditions.  Am I happy with this lens, well, yes.  Am I delighted with this lens, well, no.  Here are a few pros and cons:  First the pros;  this is a lightweight lens that compliments the NEX system well.  I bought the NEX because my DSLR and assorted lenses just became too big and heavy.  Putting a heavy, large lens on an NEX would defeat my purpose, so the Zeiss gets top scores here.  Given enough light this is a very sharp lens yielding outstanding image quality.  I find I need less tweaking in Lightroom using this lens/camera combination than I do with my Canon 60d DSLR system.  Focus is fast in single shot and image stabilization seems to work well.  Now the downside.  16 - 70 is just a bit short to be my only walk around lens.  I still carry the 55-210 for added reach.  I wish the lens went out to 110 or so.  Secondly, this is not a fast lens.  Low light photography requires boosted ISO and/or slow shutter speeds.  This combined with the limited capabilities of the built in flash on my NEX6 led to some frustration and blurry and noisy shots.  So I carry a fast prime for low light.  Which brings me to my final negative about this lens, it isn't the one lens for every situation that I really wish for and at this price I would hope to have come closer.  Either longer length or faster aperture would add huge value to this lens.So wil I keep it or send it back?  Jury still out.  If I reflect on the original reason that I bought into the NEX system in the first place, which is a smaller, lighter system that retains most if not all of the capabilities of my DSLR then this lens is a great addition.  If I look at the price/performance value equation the answer might be to fill out a return form.  In the end this is a good if not great lens with excellent build quality and results that will please in most situations."],["An excellent lens, and useful zoom range.  The detail, color and overall &#34;pop&#34; of pictures taken with this lens make it worth every penny.

It makes some of the others (particularly the 18200LE look positively dull and washed out in comparison.After a firmware update (NEX6 1.02), focus is lightning fast.

Very versatile with sharpness, color saturation, and size on par.  It's a pleasant lens to work with!  I've compared the sharpness and saturation with my other old school Zeiss lenses, and it clearly holds it's own.  Being a F4 is nothing of a take away, every lens has certain features.  I work with what those particulars are to my advantage.  Clearly nice glass!"],["I purchased this lens to use on my NEX-7.  It appears to be a sharp as the other lenses I own including the 24 mm Zeiss. Unlike what other reviewers have found, it focuses as fast as the other lenses on my camera, including in dim light.  The focal lengths cover 95% of what I shoot.  The only issue I have is the maximum aperture of only f/4. Of course a larger aperture would have made the lens quite large and heavy.In summary, a very high quality lens light enough to carry around all day with great resolution."],["This lens is absolutely clinically sharp and has Zeiss color rendition with great optical stabilization.

The size of the lens is good and feels solid, but not L class solid.  I suspect that Sony has some hand in the design even though the blue label is on the barrel.  The most disappointing thing was the filter size because I use my polarizer outdoors (really) and don't like lens caps, so I would need that pricey clear filter.  The colors are great, but the OSS is not as good as the stock zoom.  F4 does not have that separation as a wider prime, but my lens bag is already crowded enough as it is.  My impression is that I wish they released this zoom earlier, like years earlier, because I feel like the Nex system is already at that point of over maturity."],["First off, do not get this lens If you're shooting JPG. Certainly not worth the 1K price. You'll notice only the slightest improvement in color and image quality. Seriously, you'll be disappointed between this lens and a kit. This has to do with the NEX systems JPG engine which is documented well over at DP Review. Stick with the kits. Go for the power zoom 16-50 OSS.However, if you're shooting RAW this this lens will not disappoint! Really complements the NEX-7 camera. Always thought the &#34;Zeiss&#34; color and glass was hyperbole until shooting with this in RAW. The color is very accurate and IQ is really crisp, especially at 35mm. Only had to do one round of color correction in Aperture and some selective color tweaking in Photoshop when shooting product (Fine art canvas paintings for reproduction.). If I had a more accurate lighting solution when shooting then I might not even need to do that. While not *super bright* the f4 throughout the entire zoom range is really beneficial! Especially when shooting products and landscapes. This is really a great lens IF you're using manual settings shooting RAW.One caveat: Some early adopters have experienced softness in their IQ. I waited a few months and my lens was fine and doesn't suffer from this issue. In fact, it's pretty damn sharp throughout the entire zoom range. But should you decided to take the plunge and purchase this lens &#8211; test the heck out of it right away. Exchange for another one should you experience the IQ issue."],["Bought this from a competing vendor on pre-order and received it on Monday. The construction quality is excellent and lens is much sharper than kit lenses on the NEX series. It's very quiet and AF is fast. The SEL1670Z is crisp and color is beautiful. Zeiss characteristics come through. The corners of the 16-70 are good on the NEX-7 at 4.0 both wide and long end of zoom. The lens takes fantastic pictures and is very flexible but it is limited to f4 so it's really a day use lens or use flash or tripod at night. I like the size and f2.8 would have have been much bigger/heavier. It's nice to have the same aperture throughout the zoom range. I see that as a big benefit especially in lower light as you change zoom length. OSS is nice and does give it a couple stops but doesn't help a lot at full zoom hand held which is expected."],["It seems like all lenses that are considered \"compromise\" lenses covering a significant range are very challenging to rate because it's so tempting to compare them to other zooms with less range and primes.  If you don't need the convenience and versatility of a constant f4 zoom that covers the full frame equivalent of 24-105 then your expectations for this lens are more than likely misguided.  However, for those that do want that convenience and versatility, the 16-70 f4 is a very impressive lens.The lens is smaller than you might expect from a zoom that covers this much range and it balances perfectly on the NEX 7.  It is similar in size to the 24 f1.8 and the 18-55 kit lens (slightly larger than both).  The focus ring and zoom ring are smooth and the lens hood is easy to attach and remove.  Image quality is very good with center sharpness excellent and edges and corners very good especially stopped down to f5.6 or better.  Autofocus performance is fast and quiet in good light but I haven't had the opportunity to test indoors much and there have been some reports of the autofocus struggling some in low light.I would probably rate the lens a 4 1/2 if that were possible based on a couple of potential negatives.  There does seem to be a fair amount of CA from what I've seen so far although it is easily corrected in most cases.  Also, there are several reports of QC issues with this lens with reports of decentering especially.  I haven't found that to be the case with my copy but if true that needs to be rectified quickly for a high end lens like the 16-70.Overall, if you want to get as close as you can to having your cake and eating it too with the best image quality you can get in a versatile, then the 16-70 is about as good as it gets.  If, on the other hand, you are either looking for max convenience or max image quality then you have other options that may better fit your needs like the 18-200 for convenience or the rapidly improving high quality primes like the Zeiss 32 or the Sony 24,35,and 50 for max image quality."],["When I first purchased this lens and tested it against my 18-55mm kit lens, the new Zeiss lens tested better, but only marginally, and I doubted that it was worth the considerably higher price.  But I kept it and used it daily during a three week trip in New Zealand.  My images were better than I had expected them to be, and now I am happy that I kept this lens.  It is an excellent lens!"],["I just received my Zeiss 1670Z from Amazon.  I own most of the other e mount lenses for my NEX 7.  The Zeiss 1670Z is a bit larger and heavier than my Zeiss 24 (duh).  I agree with the others that have commented on the IQ similarity of the two lenses.  It goes without saying that the IQ of both lenses is top notch and a notch above most of my other Sony lenses.  I think the 1670Z may have slightly richer color and deeper saturation than the Zeiss 24 at the same focal length.  I don't have the dreaded \"decentering\" problem that some have reported.  The focusing speed seems about the same as the Zeiss 24.  The Zeiss 24 is, however,  a good 2 stops better in low light than the Zeiss 1670Z.  The 1670Z does good enough for most of my low light picture taking.  Both lenses look and feel like high end quality lenses to the eye and touch.  The Zeiss 1670Z lens is exactly what I expected and hoped for."],["I have been anxiously waiting for this lens to come out ever since it's rumored to be coming at the end of this year. I pre-ordered the first day of announcement and received my first copy in early October. I was super disappointed at the quality of my first copy and later learned at forums that this lens seems to have a lot of QC issue around decentering. I did some simple decentering test at home and confirmed that my copy was decentered. I returned it and got my current replacement copy and redid the decenter test and this copy turned out to be good.I have tested this lens pretty extensively I am pretty happy with the result so far. Of course the sharpness cannot compare to my 32mm touit prime, but comparing to my 18-55mm kit zoom lens, the contrast and sharpness are both much superior. I also tested the auto focused since some people seem to have encountered some issue with it, but so far mine performed fine, focusing was fast without noise and hunting. Unlike my 32mm, which is pretty noisy when it hunts for focus. But I use mostly manual focus, so that is less of a concern for me."],["The corners and edges are very blurry at all focal lengths and f-stop settings.  The center sharpness was OK in all my test images, but none of the four corners ever became sharp or even close to sharp.  My test photos were taken where the entire scene was at the same distance so everything should have been in focus.  I tried tests at a distance of 25 feet and 300 feet with the camera on a tripod using self-timer.  I was hoping for something much better than my Sony 16-50PZ lens, but the SEL1670Z lens I tested was much worse.  I have returned the SEL 1670Z lens to Amazon (thank you Amazon for making returns painless).  If you buy the SEL 1670Z, test the image quality carefully before the money-back interval expires.  By the way, I get consistently good results from my 16-50PZ lens.  Zeiss is famous for its excellent lenses, but this tarnishes their reputation."],["Great lens, works well with the new Sony A6000.  It is lightweight and has a great range for street shooting.  Images are crisp and clear.

First, I have had several Nikon cameras in the past with kit lenses and even higher price zoom and macro lenses.  The photos were good, not great. So yes I fell into the Nikon trap (my wife) insisted I buy Nikon &#8220;it is the best.&#8221;  Yea&#8230;so I branched out (on my own) first with a Canon G11, awesome pics, blew the nikons away with very little effort.  So yes (I&#8217;m right, she&#8217;s wrong)  fast forward 2014&#8230;.enter Sony a6000&#8230;AWESOME camera BTW (no I did not leave a review-see other reviews, yes it is that good).  I bought the Sony 50mm F1.8 E mount, by mistake, as I read it as 18-50mm F1.8, great lens but not for a family man, portrait guy, by all means, go for it.  It had to go back.  Enter the Sony SEL1670Z Vario-Tessar T E 16-70mm F4 ZA OSS&#8230;.hmmm&#8230;.$1000 for a lens.  Yep go for it, you will not regret it.  A lot of $$$$, but I can say I have never taken better pictures.  The reason I did not leave a review for the camera is because this lens ROCKS and makes the camera!  Suck it up and buy it&#8230;what&#8217;s a couple $200 extra. Enjoy and hope this helps!!  Yes&#8230;my wife even said &#8220;WOW, what great picts of the kids, I am impressed!&#8221;"],["I really do enjoy this lens. Having constant f4 aperture is great! Even at full 70mm I can get nice bokeh and great photos at low light situations. The only problem is the price. At nearly $1000, this lens's usefulness is debatable. You get a little more zoom than the 18-55mm paired with the NEX cameras and the 16-50Mm paired with the newer NEX and a5000/6000 cameras. But the 18-55mm is $300 retail and can be found for as little as $130 used/refurbished. Is 15-20mm more zoom and one f stop less worth another whopping $700???The value just isn't there. I'm not sure what exactly you would use this for except for better low light photography and a replacement for the kit lens for everyday use. But at the price premium, it's not worth it. I bought this as a part of my bundle with my new a6000. I enjoyed trying this lens out but ultimately I'm going to be selling it. I just can't justify the price and utility ratio for this."]],"title":"Sony SEL1670Z Vario-Tessar T E 16-70mm F4 ZA OSS","total_reviews":24,"sentiment":0.9283375,"label":"positive","best_review":["Great lens, works well with the new Sony A6000.

The only thing is that the bass isn't too great it's ok so if you like to listen to music with bass or lime the bassy effects in movies you might not be too pleased as you would be with different and more expensive models with separate subwoofer."],["The Sony HT-XT1 2.1 Channel Sound Bar with Built-In Subwoofer is for this user a real winner. I have to say that this is a type of product that has been way overdue in coming to market. I am a long time fan of Sony sound bar/woofer systems, and have owned several different models. Although this unit is not intended to replace an AV receiver and speakers setup, or even one of the higher powered super sound-bars, it is perfect for the type of use that many people want a sound-bar for: to provide decent sound beyond the usually dismal audio output of most flat screen TVs.The feature set on the Sony HT-XT1 is very similar in many ways to other Sony sound bars, with the same basic HDMI input switching, sound profiles, controls, etc. But this time they have folded the whole thing, including the woofer, into a fairly unobtrusive and stylish slim box that acts as a pedestal for TVs, but is still thin enough to be tucked into a shelf below the TV level if that is needed. The system also has Bluetooth connectivity with NFC, digital audio decoding for most DTS HD, DolbyTruHD, PCM, Dolby Digital+ modes, an optical audio input and analog audio input, and the now almost obligatory tie in to an almost relevant smartphone app. Sony promotes this as a pedestal base for TVs to sit on. I personally would be a little worried about bass vibration at higher volume shaking up the TV components over the long haul. But for a TV with a wall mount, or for average level listening, or with the unit placed a level lower there should not be any problem.Although it doesn't have super bass, it has more than enough for the sort of bedroom and small living room use it is obviously designed for. If you have a McMansion sized living room or a bedroom the size of an entire 60s tract home then this might not be the best choice. But for more intimate viewing situations, in a small to medium sized room with the viewing/listening position within ten feet or so of the TV, this is a very good choice.Although one can debate the relative bass output of this unit compared to systems with separate sub-woofers, there is no denying that the loss of the separate, usually bulky and hard to place sub-woofer speaker is a big plus in fitting this enhanced sound system into a small living room, den or bedroom. It visually blends in very well with most TVs, sounds great, and is affordable. It's a great addition to the ever expanding line of Sony sound-bar systems. I am happy with my Sony HT-XT1 2.1 Channel Sound Bar. RECOMMENDED."],["Wow!  I am not a sound tech by any stretch, but due to the reviews on many of these bars, I was not expecting much.  What we got was far more than what we expected.  We wanted to get rid of the myriad of speakers from our old system, with a huge base unit.  We are also getting older and we were having issues hearing the dialog at times.  So this was our answer after much review - being ok with stepping down from deep base, and crisp uppers - we actually stepped up - we made the RIGHT choice.  It came early in the day, so I took it home during lunch - and figured - go for it (thinking I would at least begin to set it up).  Before my time was up (20 min.) I was sitting and watching Tivo and being blown away by the sound and clarity.  Two wires, and one was the power!  Love it.  We looked at the Bose bar, and Yamaha, but are very happy we chose Sony!"],["I have limited space and this sound bar fits the bill.  Hard rock to opera sounds great (and I like both.)  You know those movies and TV shows that you have trouble hearing some of the dialogue (like Kiefer Sutherland's sexy low voice?)  This Sound Bar makes it possible for me to actually hear all the words.  Love the options it gives me and the remote is actually user friendly."],["I had the Bose Solo TV and the sound was good but I wanted better. I saw a review for this speaker on Cnet and after their reconmendation and much research I purchased the Sony Soundbar. I love it. The sound is great and my Blu Rays sound excellent. It's very easy to set up and the sound is good. If you are interested in getting a soundbar and want something that has great sound this is a must bar."],["First off, I'm also diggin' the new 40&#34; Bravia, but we all know how muffled the current flat screen speakers are. The sound separation sucks, voices can get lost with background sounds, and acceptable bass response just doesn't exist. The other two I considered were: the Yamaha YAS-103 (maybe an acceptable improvement, and I thought the IR pass-through for TV control was slick, but the unit really is a huge bulky eyesore). The other was the Onkyo LS-T10 sound base- (usually good audiophile equipment, and 7 speakers instead of 4, but lower wattage, and some poorer reviews on the lack of inputs, friendliness of connectivity, and perhaps a certain muddines of sound coming with 6 small speakers of the exact same size). A review I read said the Onkyo may actually have a slight edge when watching movies, but the Sony was more well-rounded, better with music, and better with most everything else. I concur!So, my system is SONY... Bravia/Blu-Ray/HT-XT1, and 2 HDMI cables, and everything integrates beautifully. At first connection, and watching over-the-air TV broadcast, it was better, but I still wondered if its' worth the 300. THEN.... I popped in my Thor-the dark world Blu-ray, and the whole system came to life! Deep rumbling bass, along with perfect mids and highs too- it really does sound theater-like and just perfect for a medium sized room. Then, it was time for Avatar- the rumbling battles and explosions near the end would have been flat and lifeless without this sound base. Very impressed! No. it's not Dolby THX surround in an IMAX theater, but it really is ten times more immersive than the sorry-excuse for speakers that come in the TV. I was having a hard time justifying another $300, for a $500 TV, but the sound was garbage, and I had no choice. Now though, I'm thoroughly ecstatic by how much better an experience I have with Blu-ray and HD sources, and am 100% pleased with this unit.As far as looks, it's one slick unit. Nice glass top, quality looks all-over, nice dimmable front display, even the reverse-pyramid feet/supports are a great idea. And if I go up later on to a 48&#34; to 55&#34; inch TV, I'm sure I'd still be pleased with the volume and quality coming from this super-slick pizza box of a sound system! Oh, and the 3 settings for the 'clear voice' amplification work exceeding well too, not that I need it that much. I really like this unit and think it sounds great, and the bass, even at medium setting, is a HUGE improvement in watching and listening pleasure. For me quality reigns overs quantity, so I read all I could, then picked the Sony over the Onkyo, and don't regret spending the $300 any more! I'd buy another in a heartbeat, and recommend to anyone looking at a great quality, exceptional sounding, all-in-one TV sound improvement solution."],["Fantastic !!!  Works well with our new 50&#34; Polaroid HiDef TV- easy set up too. Song Pal app for iPhone is nice addition as controller or play your tunes.Would definitely recommend."],["The instruction manual is fairly short, but this soundbar is feature rich. ...Not necessarily a great combo.I'm not blown away by the remote. It's so slim it could (and has) easily been lost between couch cushions.My tech level is high, yet I was unable to get the TV and/or Dish remote to change the volume or power on/off the HT-XT1. (Either by remote code or ARC using a newer, too-line Vizio TV.)THE SOUND: It sounds good. It gets loud, if that's what you want. You may adjust the bass/woofer volume, too.My spinning stand fits on the speaker just fine.With so much hdmi action, you'd think on-screen menus would be a good route. Instead, you have to use the small cryptic LED screen on the sound bar itself. That means that you pretty much need to use the manual to interpret the abbreviations and acronyms on the little screen until you learn them. On-screen menus would have been much smarter....and the last word: It's a great value. Lots of features, good sound, decent price, and only a few drawbacks."],["Finally a decent pedestal sound bar from a major company other than Bose.  Sounds better than the Bose, has all the features you could want like 3 hdmi , bass and treble controls, volume leveling, etc. etc. all in a nice looking package.  Great remote, although I CAN turn it on and off and control the volume with my Comcast remote so once set up, I really don't need it often.  Word of advice, lower the subwoofers (dual subs) to 6 or 7 and it sounds great.  I put it on the &#34;Movie&#34; sound field, the sub at 7 and I'm happy.  Sony has hit a home run with this pedestal bar.  They will sell many!"],["Best home TV audio system I have ever purchased. Before purchasing this device, I had the Samsung model of a soundstand. I exchanged it for the Sony model. The sound coming from the Sony model is AMAZING!! BIG SOUND!! The treble is crisp and the bass is surprising deep. The bass can rattle the entire house. The system controls for tuning the audio are excellent. You can adjust both the treble and bass. You can even disable the lights on the front screen. The ARC volume control function works seamlessly with my 2014 Samsung TV. It sounds better on a wood surface than a glass surface."],["Love the low profile and full sound of this sound bar. It was easy to hook up and configure, though it still requires someone with some tech savvy. I would not recommend it for the tech-challenged elderly parent. (Get the Yamaha YAS-101BL for them.)The sound is not bass heavy, so if you really like big bass, this is not the sound bar for you. You'll want one with a separate sub-woofer that is at least 6&#34; in diameter. This uses 2 small speakers for the subs (facing downward, mounted on the bottom of the device). For me that was fine, because I was looking for something compact, low profile, all-in-one.It has a full, round sound - not too tinny, not too bassy. It really seems like a fairly balanced sound. It is dramatically better than my 55&#34; Son LCD TV, but not nearly at rich as my Samsung full-surround wireless system.  Really it is just perfect for my family room, where I wanted a richer sound, simple setup, minimal footprint, and I didn't need surround sound.I wish it wasn't quite so expensive. It would be a fantastic device for $200. At $300, it's a bit over-priced, but I still don't regret the purchase."],["We have a Sonos playbar in our living room but my home office (and my budget) can't exactly fit another one. I've got a rather old Sony LCD TV that I've had for a few years now. The speakers aren't great on it and the way my office is laid out, it isn't really practical to set up a home theater system (plus, I don't really have that sort of budget anyway).Along game this sound bar. It's got a built-in subwoofer that gets the job done and the sound is nice and clear. It's a great upgrade to built-in speakers and a lot tidier than a wired home theater system. You get a selection of sound presets and (at least for me) three HDMI inputs along with an HDMI output for your TV. I had a little switchbox to deal with my multiple HDMI devices and my old TV's single HDMI input. There's also an optical port if that's your thing.It comes with a little remote that's kind of cool looking but a bit flimsy. Depending on your setup you can probably just cut it out of the equation unless you really need it. Also, it doesn't come with HDMI cables, so definitely be sure you've got some or bring some. The device is rather deep (or I guess wide depending on how you're looking at it) so be sure to check the dimensions in the product info. For me, this turned out to be fine. While there's a limit to how much you can put on top of this (the top of the device is actually glass!), I was able to put my TV on top so space-wise, I'm great. From a space-saving perspective, I'm actually really happy about this sound bar since the speakers are up front so anything on top won't block the sound. Just worked out great for me.One other thing to note, while most of my devices worked fine with the device, at least one, a Sony Blu-Ray player, showed a lot of interference. The manual recommends high speed cables and I can't vouch for some of these cables I'm using so I'm reserving judgment on that front until I've had a chance to get a new cable and test that out. Bear in mind, the Blu-Ray is on a shelf about six inches below the sound bar so there's the potential that the subwoofer is causing the issue (though the player is on the opposite side of where the subwoofer is).That said, compared to the cost of the Sonos system (which is a nice system, don't get me wrong), this is a nice system to put in place when your budget isn't quite so big or when you aren't looking for all the features of a system like that (between the Sonos Playbar and their subwoofer, you're looking at 4X the cost of this). Plus, for smaller rooms, this will likely be a better fit than something like that which is really made for larger rooms.For me the best part is simply the fact that I can finally get some great audio out of my setup when I'm watching TV or a movie in here. If you can afford it, I don't think you could go wrong by grabbing this. Don't expect it to be a 5.1 system, obviously. It's 2.1. But I wouldn't hold that against this device either. So much better than built-in speakers and so much more organized than setting up some sort of home theater system."],["Sony nailed it with this 2.1 channel sound bar! My 51\" inch plasma television, like most TV's, doesn't put out much sound right out of the box. This Sony HT-XT1 adds some much needed punch to it. This 51\" plasma is in a 15 X 15 room and I sit back a good 8 feet from it, so at times it can be hard to hear some movies and shows even with the volume at full blast. This Sony sound bar provides crystal clear sound and just the right amount of bass to not \"run\" you out of the room. I don't know how this sound bar would work in a much larger room: You may need to step up to a 5.1 sound system for that. However, for smaller to medium size rooms this Sony is more than adequate.In total, unboxing and hooking it up, took about 20 minutes. It's really easy to set-up(and use) and once set-up it looks very aesthetically pleasing, matching my Samsung plasma quite well! You don't have to worry about it taking up any space either because your television sits on it.... my tv needed a boost in height anyway! So, would you rather have that dismal 20 watts of speaker power coming from your standard television or 170 watts of Sony sound bar power eliciting powerful bass and very clear sound(voices now sound super clear)? Sony is known for making very high quality products and this is no exception. You really can't go wrong for the price versus other competing brands. This one will do me for years to come!!"],["Just picked this up yesterday.  The wife and I placed it under our Sony 50&#34; LED 3D Tv.

If you are planing to connect this for a large room, this will not do it for you. you are better off buying a full blown system.

I wish it had the 3D surround sound technologySometimes the streams will drop when using bluetooth connected to a phone (I streamed the sound of music videos from youtube and it kept cutting in and out).ConclusionI almost went with the wireless subwoofer and soundbar that Sony has but figured it would be overkill for my current setup.  If you are looking for something to enhance the quality of your television speakers, this bad boy is more than sufficient.  I use this for everything.  Gaming, movies, entertainment, etc.  Oh, it comes with  3 HDMI inputs and 1 HDMI out.  You connect the HDMI out *ARC* to the television (to one of the HDMI ports to your TV) you then use whatever port you connected from the ARC to your TV and the sound system does the rest.  Plug everything else into the HDMI ports of the sound system and BOOM!  You are in business.  Very easy to set up."],["Sound crystal clear , sleek  look"],["The sound is amazing.

I playback high quality music, video games and TV and it all sound excellent. The surround sound works very well. Rear sounds are projected nicely. The bass is a little weak, but I would expect this from a unit that doesn't have a dedicated bass.I have used the sound system with an iPhone 5 and it works fine over bluetooth.One thing to note if you have a smart TV. Use the ARC on the TV and the sound is not heard when switching between apps on the TV. The sound works fine while using any of the apps so I don't care that I don't hear the &#34;swoosh&#34; sounds when scrolling through apps.Also, if you have a computer attached using HDMI and you're using VLC for video playback, be sure to choose the Audio menu, Audio Device and select HDMI (Encoded Output) to achieve the proper surround sound."],["This is a new purchase and I am pretty much delighted with it apart from one issue as I mention at the end. Anyway I set it up with my PS4 and first checked out the sound from Man of Steel blu ray as loud as I dared on the Movie setting without upsetting the neighbors. It was so much better than my LED TV speakers, clear voices even with loud music in the background and the booming explosions sounded amazing. I then tried a Netflix film with Kill Bill and in this case the voices in some scenes sounded too heavy with bass, I found the voice setting on the remote and took it from 1 which is normal to 2 which is slightly voice enhanced and it sounded great for Kill Bill, will keep that setting for all movies. There is also a voice 3 for people that really have issues hearing voices over background noise.I then paired my iPhone and iPad with the sound bar which was incredibly easy. Music sounds really great after I tweaked the Treble, Bass and Sub Woofer Loudness through the Sony Song Pal app which I have downloaded to the devices. So I should set expectations in that the music isn't as stunningly good as using my high end headphones but I would have been surprised if it was. This after all is a pretty cheap sound bar but even so it is a very acceptable quality indeed.I have one issue to figure out since I bought this yesterday, I can't get sound from my TV channels from an inside antenna. The optical cable supplied does not appear to fit in the audio optical out on my new Samsung TV and using a HDMI cable as directed does not produce sound. Sure I will figure out after another play around but in the end I will be using this mostly for movies played on blu ray or Netflix through my PS4 and for music so if it never gets sorted that's acceptable."],["On the surface, I thought comparing theSony HT-XT1 2.1 Channel Sound Bar with Built-In Subwooferto any Bose product, including theBose Solo TV Sound Systemwould be ridiculous - but I was completely wrong. The Sony HT-XT1 really holds its own as a simple, compact, single unit 2.1 soundbar. I tried both the Bose and Sony in my master bedroom for about 2 weeks and was thoroughly impressed with the sound and build quality of the Sony soundbar.I am not an audiophile or tech junkie. I am sure that there are some differences in the technical specifications of the two units and what output they display on a spectrometer, but to the average layperson's ear - they both sound great. And hence lies the problem, if the cheaper Sony sounds just as good, albeit without as much muddled bass, as the Bose, does it make sense to buy the Bose Solo just for the brand name?The Sony packs an impressive 170 watts of power into a very small frame and delivers deep, rich and broad sound throughout the room without having to worry about wiring a multi-component 2.1 system or finding space for it in a small room, like a bedroom.As expected, the Sony includes Bluetooth connectivity, but it also adds NFC functionality which is nice for quick connecting your phone to stream music when as you approach. It includes one HDMI output and 3 HDMI inputs, which I think is too few and the units only flaw. If you have a Bluray player, streaming movie player, like anAmazon Fire TV, cable box, and game console, you are out of luck unless you buy a splitter.Having tested both units in my master bedroom, I can honestly say that the Sony HT-XT1, at $100 cheaper than the Bose Solo, is a great value and perfect purchase for a small to medium sized room."],["The Sony HT-XT1 is a great option for those of us who don't want the bulk, hassle, and expense of a receiver and multiple speakers. Because it fits under the TV, rather than in front of it, it doesn't block the TV and interfere with the remote control's line of sight, like traditional soundbars do.The sound is bold and full, and--this was very important to me--doesn't drown out the dialog track with extraneous background noise. There are actually 3 separate settings that help draw out the dialog track for hard-of-hearing people. There is also a night mode that promises clear sound at low volumes.Overall, this unit is very attractive, simple to set up, and its sound is a substantial upgrade from most TV speakers.Pros- Very attractive piano black finish, glass top, and understated display.- Unique design that fits under the TV.- DTS and Dolby Digital compatible.- Built-in subwoofers.- 3 HDMI inputs, plus S/PDIF.- Supports Audio Return Channel.- BlueTooth audio pairing with smartphones and tablets is simple and the sound is good.- Special settings for emphasizing dialog tracks.Cons- Holds maximum of 66 lbs, which limits most plasma TVs that will safely fit on top of it.- The remote is square with sharp edges, which makes it uncomfortable to hold. It hides most of its functions behind a silly slide-out door, and has black-on-black, some of which are tiny. It is not easy to use, though many people will use a universal remote instead.- It automatically shuts off after a certain period of no audio. This makes sense for power savings, but it confounds my Harmony universal remote."],["Pros:- Separate Bass and Treble controls- Near Field communications (NFC )- Good visual/industial design- Smaller and easier to accommodate than a sound bar space wise.- I love the compact, trick remote.Cons:- Bluetooh missing Apt-x codec.

The XT1 makes the best out of what it has.- Sony could've went with two woofers and two tweeters along with a sub in a case of this size instead of 2 midrange and two subswoofers in a case of this size.- Small sound chambers = limited low frequency response.  Physics are physics.This was purchased for use in a bedroom to replace a Samsung HW-E450 which died prematurely.  I am using the XT1 with a Samsung ES7100 TV, Samsung BD-E5900 Blu-Ray player, Samsung Galaxy player 3.6, Samsung Galaxy S4, and Samsung Galaxy Note 3.  The XT1 plays well with various Samsung devices.I must qualify that the E450 has more power, greater width (and stereo separation), had two tweeters, 4 midrange and a dedicated external subwoofer.  The E450 produced greater bass and more channel separation.  Yet the XT1 seems to be cleaner sounding for music.  I attribute this to the sound field options on the XT1.  The Samsung just seemed to not have any that work as well for music.  On the other hand, the E450 was just plain better for movies, period. There's no replacement for displacement and I would never consider this unit for the living room.  Get a soundbar with a subwoofer...better yet, get a proper receiver, front speakers, subwoofer, center and surrounds.  This unit is best utilized for smaller spaces.The XT1 is a visually pleasing unit with good flexibility (3 HDMI inputs, Bluetooth streaming, HDMI CEC, digital optical input, aux input) and decent sound.  It definitely isn't audiophile grade but one can look at it's size and price point and figure that out.

I needed more sound than the TV speakers.I started my journey with sound bars, and am really happy that I ended up here. I had no dissatisfaction with the sound capabilities of my newest sound bar but the format was the problem-- the fact that it sat in front of the TV gave me problems. It was ugly/obtrusive and caused my TV to not turn on/off in sync with the sound bar. Sometimes you don't know what you don't know until you experience it, and in this case I learned that I should've bought a system that goes UNDER the TV instead of in front of it. I will review this unit as its own device and at times in comparison to the sound bar style.Shape & SizeI was really interested in the style that sit directly under the TV, having first seen the Bose Solo TV Sound System. It makes sense to take advantage of the space under and behind the TV rather than pushing the TV back against the wall to fit a sound bar in front of it. Unboxing this unit, I was impressed with how thin it is top to bottom. The pictures don't do it justice. I was surprised by that, as well by the weight of the device. Its not heavy, but it is clearly solid. It's like the difference between a Japanese car and a German one-- there is durability here.AppearanceThe top of the unit is glass, which was also a pleasant surprise. Not only is it glass, there are a few buttons like ON/OFF and PAIR on it that are touch sensitive buttons under the glass. It's a very sleek, modern, well designed device that oozes of thoughtfulness. As well, the top won't scratch as you adjust the TV angle or clean it like the sound bars that I had did because ttheir tops were shiny black plastic.The appearance of the front is also upscale and clean looking. The LCD is behind what appears like a grate or metal mesh, the LCD completely disappearing when the unit is off. My previous sound bars had old style square LEDs that had words under each one and would flicker in an upward motion for turning up the volume and downward for lowering. It felt low tech but got the job done, but this device is clearly more modern and contributes to an overall sleek TV and sound system appearance.The remote control is so futuristic and simple it made me smirk with a smile for a second. Not only is it simple and as wide as a quarter, kind of like a magic wand for your sound system, it has a slide down feature that reveals more buttons! My Sony devices in the past have been notorious for having a cluster of buttons from top to bottom so it really pleases me that they're getting the idea and simplifying. Again, it looks futuristic, but it's also simplified and easy to use. Good points for the remote control functionality and design.InstallationInstalling the unit was quite easy-- at first I simply unplugged the optical audio from my old sound bar into this device. It worked great, and no manual reading was necessary. I did breeze the quick start guide and manual though, and realized that some extra functionality would happen if I plugged it in to my Sony TV with HDMI. I didn't realize this functionality existed before and in the end is one of the best conveniences of the unit. When I turn the TV on, the unit turns on because it senses it through the HDMI. IT also turns off when I turn the TV off, and the volume up/down happens when I use the Tivo remote for the TV. This is a fantastic simplification that isn't available on other brands and models. If you have a Sony TV already, this could be a deal maker. The previous sound bars that I had worked in reverse-- the sound bar would learn the on/off code to my TV, and come on at the same time.In comparison to the sound bars, the Sony is much more accurate and simple. The sound bars that I had would often get out of \"sync\" with the TV-- sometimes almost every time. I'd turn on and the TV wouldn't turn on (because the sound bar sat in FRONT of the TV), or I'd try to turn off and the sound bar would go off but the TV would not. I would end up having to hit the on/off switch 3 times or more to get them both off at the same time. I moved, re-aligned, tweaked and tested those sound bars, but in the end the simple fact that they were designed to sit in front of the TV instead of under it was what made them an annoyance for me.Features/FunctionalityThe back of this device will give you one idea of why it's a step above introductory devices or sound bars. It has a full slate of HDMI inputs, an optical audio input, and an HDMI output for the TV. Many introductory or small devices have only an optical audio in, or maybe RCA or component in. This one has a full slate of inputs more in line with what you find on a real home theater system with a dedicated receiver and separate speakers. It even has an analog in-- if you have a dedicated MP3 type device or other device that can output to a standard headphone jack style cable. The unit takes a standard two prong electrical jack.From a features perspective, the remote covers all of the functionality that you'd want to know about: sound modes, night mode (which my sound bar didn't have and I am glad this unit does have), the ability to equalize sound levels of an input (to stop LOUD COMMERCIALS), the ability to adjust how much bass you get overall and independent from the sound modes ( like movie, music, etc.) muting, volume, sound mode, menus for settings, etc. Under most daily activities you could probably use your TV remote and not need this remote.On a daily basis, the features and settings can really disappear and you can just use the TV with the sound system without needing to change things or intervene. That being the case, there is an app available, and it is mostly geared toward streaming music to the device via Bluetooth (from a phone, etc.) or selecting the input. I was disappointed that the mobile phone app didn't include more of the device settings like competitors apps do, but it wasn't a deal breaker. The Bluetooth topic is a good transition into sound.SoundI spent an extensive amount of time swapping back and forth between this device and my Yamaha YAS-103 Soundbar. I went through my whole catalog of music from one genre to another to get a good feel for how the Sony reproduces sound as compared to my sound bar. I could probably write a book of differences, but there are some basic summaries I can make if you are comparing to the particular sound bar I had, and general feedback about this Sony--(note, I did the best to put them both in standard mode, in other matching modes throughout comparison, realizing they are not identical devices and both are fully customizable)About the Sony-The Sony had the best overall balance of lows/mids/highs and needed the least adjustment going from one type of music to the next-The Sony always sounded stereo, but sometimes the mids would feel a little flat. At some points, I felt like I wanted to adjust the subwoofer crossover point on the Sony. I felt like it was reaching a little more than necessary to reproduce some bass in the subwoofer speakers. The crossover was set a bit too high for my personal preferences. In the end I turned it down a few notches.-TV voice was very easy to hear without having to turn the volume up very far-Sometimes with a complex mix of sounds & voice, the overall sound could get muddy or feel like the bass crossover point was set too high.In comparison, the Yamaha-Had some things it's really good at, and some things it really falls flat with. For example,-The Yamaha often sounded mono, but was surprisingly realistic at reproducing sounds like guitar, piano and voice even when not in voice optimization mode-The Yamaha had less bass overall, but was really expertly tuned to not force the speakers into doing anything they weren't capable of.-Sometimes the Yamaha mids were overpowered even when not on voice mode.-The overall range felt like less, and though the overall wattage is less, it didn't feel \"quieter\" than the Sony.As you can see, a lot of intricate details about the sound were a little difficult to parse out into clear conclusions about either device, but if you wanted some sound details, hopefully those contribute to your considerations.In the end, the Sony stays and the Yamaha goes. The Sony solves the annoyances that I had with the Yamaha, looks better, is easier to use and while I can't agree with the marketing of \"heart-pounding bass\" it is a very good, pleases my ears and makes my life easier.I will update the review if I experience different conclusions. If you have specific questions please feel free to post them below and I will respond to you ASAP."],["It setup very easily.  Basically just plugged in my input devices and the dim cable out to the TV.  The sound is decent.... Not great, but a vast improvement over the built in speakers."],["I've had the HT-XT1 for about 5 days and I love it so far.The most important thing I was looking for was a soundbar that integrated well with my Sony TV. That is, I didn't want to manage a 2nd remote control for the audio. The HT-XT1 fits the bill perfectly. I connected it by HDMI, and the soundbar powers on with my TV, gets controlled by my TV remote's volume, then powers back into standby when the TV is shut off. These are features of BraviaSync which all modern Sony TVs have. Additionally, you can view all the soundbar adjustments and setup options in the TV's own interface.Pros:Compact width (about 30&#34; across) &#8212;important since my TV just sits on a little table. Other soundbars in this price range measured about 40&#34; across.Very strong bass for not having a seperate subwoofer. I turned the sub volume down to 7.Great audio quality. It feels like I'm in a movie theatre. Voices are crisp.Cons:Since the TV sits on top of this and it has integrated subwoofers, would the sound vibrations eventually cause a TV to fail over time (ie, will soldering joints fail on the circuit boards)? I have no idea so it's not really a con, but I guess the years will tell.

I would have to say every review stating this is the best TV they have seen is 100% correct. The increase color range adds a whole new look and feel to your movies :)....  The picture has really smooth movements. The curve is just enough to add a nice feel to the screen without the picture feeling like it being squeezed in the middle. I really enjoy the clean look to the set it self, it really sets its self apart from any other TV you will see on the market.  SONY did a outstanding job on the design of this set.Pros:Everything about itReally easy to setup took maybe 5-10 minsThe passive 3D seems to have good depth to it, even the simulated 3D looks impressive. (both in movies/tv and video games)It has the ability for Audio return to your Home Theater Sound System for the television aps (HDMI audio return for the Sony Sync, or the Fiber for none Sony receivers).The Option for wired or Wireless network connectivity is nice.The ability to have the lighted Sony name plate perform different functions, off, interactive (only lights up when the TV receives commands from the remote or if the sleep timer is set), bright to dim.A wide range of adjustments you can do to customize how you want your picture to look.About every Application you can think of for the smart TV capability, one specific one I used so far was Hulu and it was like watching actual cable TV (the activation was simple).Con: the display does appear to be more reflective that my other screen...  But it is not too bad.  I think this set would have really benefited from satin finished screen.I can tell you your friends will want to come over to watch movies once they see this TV."],["The color and image quality is excellent. The Triluminous display lives up to it's promise with a wider color gamut that is easily obvious when compared to it's competition.Like all edge lit LED tv's I've seen, some light bleed/flashlighting can be seen on a black screen when no signal input is detected, luckily it's mitigated when signal detected and local dimming kicks in.This set, at least the one I got, has some of the best screen uniformity I've ever seen. That's a huge plus.The screen curvature is minimal and adds to the viewing experience, more immersion to what one is watching. There is no distortion whatsoever."],["I managed to see this television in person, and we were sold almost immediately. Really beautiful looking television with an excellent quality display. It is easy to use and very feature rich, from apps to 3D (passive). For those curious about the curve, it is not very dramatic, but it is nice how it reduces some glade from side viewing. In general it adds a neat dimension to the television and makes it stand out from the competition. The speakers on this unit are also quite excellent, among the best I have heard.The only real negative I can say is that the two side mounted feet may require a large entertainment center, assuming you do not plan on wall mounting. It is trivial to me, but others may find it problematic if they have limited space."],["Had this model for about 10 days now and truly love almost everything about it with the only significant flaw being some clouding due to set not having full array local dimming; see further noes below.  Unless you plan on sitting less than 6 feet from your set this model will be hard to tell apart from a UHDTV.  Love that because the 3-D is passive I can now use clip-on 3-D glasses (that also work at the local cineplex) over my prescription glasses.  Clip-on glasses aren't included but are under $5 a pair.This model has not had any significant professional reviews which is a shame.  Most comments that have been made only talk about the &#34;gimmick&#34; of the curved screen; but I see it only as a worthwhile enhancement, both to the designer looks of the set but more importantly to the image quality, including a perception of greater depth and in expanding the off-axis viewing angle.PROS:Great near plasma blacks and shadow detail.Best 3-D I've seen, uses passive tech, 4 pairs of glasses included.Even simulated 3-D is effective for some films, like for The Fifth Element, though I have no plans to use it further now that I satisfied my curiosity.Great sound from the side speakers, only beat by the best sound bars, and has subwoofer output if you want to beef up the sound.Immersive slightly curved screen that does not detract from the viewing experience.Beautiful set to look at.Nobody does deep, rich and natural color better than Sony.Stands attached from factory but easy to remove for wall mounting.CONS:Has two separate remotes but neither one is backlit.Skype camera not included.Very heavy and need at least 65&#34; stand to hold it.Screen is very reflective and this needs to be considered in placement.The one significant flaw is that this model suffers from some clouding when watching in dark environment; not though a fatal flaw because it can be calibrated out to a large degree and does not show with most program material.Still in process of tweaking my settings but will update the review once I'm comfortable with them.  One thing though that I would say is that the Resolution setting is a great enhancement that should not be turned off as some reviewers of similar Sony models have suggested.  Very useful in the range of 40 to 60, and seems to be one of the settings that helps with clouding.  Backlight seems to work best at about 6 in dark room and 9 or 10 (max) in a brighter room and for 3-D.This TV replaced a Panasonic model 65ST50 plasma and I don't regret it because for other than slightly poorer blacks on the Sony, nearly everything else is an improvement."],["This TV was better than expected. The picture is great and the color superb. The 3D is truly the best I have seen on TVs or at the movies. A truly remarkable set. I am 78 and I don't often write revues but this set blew me away."],["Starting with the good stuff - this TV is a beauty when off.  The subtle curve and deep black panel make it look like a nice piece of high-tech equipment in the home.And of course it looks even better when you turn it on: excellent detail, clarity, and best of all - the colors.  Accurate skin tone, and the colors can pop if you want them too.  Also, deep inky blacks with excellent contrast.  The curve isn't really noticeable while watching a movie or show, much in the same way a movie screen's curve disappears in the theater.If there's a gamer in the house, in Game Mode this TV is rated as one of the lowest input lag of any TV you can buy.  I haven't tried a 3D movie yet, but have been very impressed with the passive 3D on the Playstation 3 and PS4.But no TV is perfect, and this one's flaw seems to be inconsistent (non-uniform) backlighting.  Fortunately, local dimming and the LED Control setting can eliminate this issue during regular programming.  So even though solid white or color test screens might show some slightly non-uniform patches, these flaws aren't noticeable watching TV or movies.  And when the screen fades to black - it looks like the TV is turned off.  The main exception to this is a black screen with some content, like credits over black.  Some flash-lighting can been seen because of this TV's LED backlights.Other things to know - the screen is pretty reflective, and the curve can distort the refection.  So if there's a window or a lamp directly behind the viewer, the reflection might appear exaggerated, or disappear, because of the curve.  Also, this TV is best viewed straight on, because off-axis viewing distorts the colors and black levels a little bit.  Lastly, this sucker is over 100 pounds, so keep that in mind if you are mounting.So I knocked off one star for these issues, but the most important thing to note is watching movies and TV programs on this TV is a treat.  The colors and black levels are very impressive, and the backlight issue may or may not be noticeable or bother everyone."],["I was a bit hesitant at first about this TV because it was priced a bit high (relative to the Samsung counterpart), and not many reviews online.  But, I must say that the reviews I found were mainly positive, and I've been happy with Sony's TV products in the past.  So I took a chance, and I have to say, this TV is fantastic.  The picture quality is flawless.  The speakers are this TV are excellent, as it essentially has two sound bars along the edges.  Even the bass is pretty solid coming out of a TV.  But if you get this TV, I definitely recommend hooking it up to an actual A/V Receiver for the best sound quality.I've owned this TV for about 3 weeks now -- let's just say you'll start watching TV a lot more simply because the picture quality is mind blowing.  I owned a 5year old 47&#34; 1080p LG LCD before.  There's simply no comparison.One thing that I was skeptical about regarding this TV is the refresh rate of 120HZ.  I was hoping that given the price for this TV and the fact that it's a relatively new, high-end TV, the default refresh rate would be 240HZ.  But, I do not see any fuzz, whether I'm watching fast paced sports or movies.  Apparently 120HZ seems fine to me.The curved feature is also a great look - though I was skeptical about it when I ordered it online (without having seen it at any store).  If the budget is there, this TV is hands down one of the best that I've seen."],["Came across this TV recently in a local store. It was brilliant and captured my attention right away. This TV is definitely the new trend coming. Almost made the purchased that day for a TV in my family room. Luckily, my 3series BMW was too small to stuff this inside at the time. When I got home, I was shocked to find out my Sony KDL46HX820 that I purchased in January, 2012 started developing vertical lines. The next morning, the entire screen was covered with vertical lines. Contacted Sony and their representative return with a reply of a few possible solution, but none of them work.BTW this is part of their reply: &#34;Despite the precautions taken during the course of design and production, as well as quality assurance, no manufacturer can completely eliminate potential component failure. We can only hope that your faith in Sony products be restored.&#34;It is basically telling you that you're screwed, go get another Sony that will FAIL soon after the warranty ends. Overall, I would buy this TV if I am planning to throw this out after two years of use. Otherwise, I would look into some other brand. Everyone in my family has been a loyal fan dating back to my father's first radio cassette player. But sorry Sony we're moving away from your brand, and I'm also making a good effort to keep others informed before they have to feel my pain."],["This TV is a quality you can expect from Sony.Amazing image, easy to set up and great features. Built in wireless works very fast when streaming from the local hard drive or network. For the price its hard to buy better TV than that."],["awesome tv, but the interface is slow and buggy, which makes navigation cumbersome, looks amazing though specially 3d if the interface was smooth it would be perfect!"],["I had to write a review for this one to help bring the 5 star rating down a bit to a more realistic level. For the other 5 star ratings, nothing against your reviews. Glad you were able to luck out and get a great set. Mine however is a very mixed bag. The curved screen is cool and the viewing angles do appear to be improved. However, the screen uniformity is awful. I'm not the only one with the same issues. There are others (see avforum) who have had the same clouding and flashlighting issues I have experienced. The blacks are definitely not black on my set but rather deep treys at best. No amount of adjusting seems to help. Even after going through several phones calls and emails with Sony to improve, nothing helped the picture improve. Sony would not send a tech to look into the issues but rather had the response that the issues I am experiencing are common to LED TVs, and they therefore would not attempt to fix anything. This set is being returned to them for a full refund. Back to the hunt once more. So frustrating.I have also tried out the 65W850A, which had some problems in certain months of manufacturing and I got a few bad ones. I can say, however, that the picture on the 65W850A easily rivals this set, however, I prefer the S990 due to passive 3D. Still, with both having issues, I have not yet found the perfect set for me.Happy hunting. Again, if you can get a &#34;good one&#34; of these without all the clouding/uniformity issues like some of the other 5 stars on here, this really is a stellar TV. Unfortunately, buyer beware - you are rolling the dice."],["@DrZoidberg81 your stupid. This is a review of this TV. Not the TV you have from sony. Lol. If that's the case let me give you a review about the PlayStation 4. Any ways I have this TV, and it has the best picture quality of any lcd tv on the market. It has the best design I ve seen and it had good sound quality, even though I mainly listen to the Sony st7 sounds bar I have which is amazing. But I have an extended warranty through the nex so I don't have to deal with sony sorry ass customer services. But it's a must buy if your looking for a 65&#34; tv, and if you want to impress your neighbors."],["I ordered this TV open box from Wizard Electroland at a great price and the TV arrived in all original packaging and everything looked 100% brand new. I couldn't even tell the box had ever been opened.Personally I think the curved screen is great. The curve is very subtle and I can't imagine it would cause concern for most people. I don't see that the curved screen really improves anything on the viewing end. From straight on you couldn't even tell the screen is curved unless you already knew it was. From slight to moderate angled viewing it seems to help see the screen better, but at extreme angles I would say the curve making viewing more difficult. I love the curve mostly for aesthetic reasons. I find it makes the tv more unique looking and has a really classy, high-end look to it. I've already gotten numerous compliments from friends and family on it.The picture quality on the TV is outstanding. I'm completely blown away. So far I just did an eye-ball calibration on the set, but I plan to run Disney's WOW calibration to further dial it in. The blacks are very deep and the colors are bright! Skin tones seem to be very realistic. The input lag is amazingly low and the tv is wonderful for gaming. The passive 3D quality is also very good and from a 10 foot viewing distance I can't really notice a drop in resolution.I use a 7.2 home theater system so I haven't used the TV speakers much, but I did test them out just because I'd heard they were really good and I will say they are by far the best sounding stock speakers I've ever heard on a flat screen tv.The TV comes with 2 remotes, which is nice. 1 is a full size remote and the other is a much smaller, cut-down remote with only more basic buttons, but it's nice to have both options. The set also came with 4 sets of 3D glasses.Because the tv has 2 feet at the ends of it you'll need about a 65&#34; long or longer stand if you aren't planning on wall mounting. I wall mounted mine right off the bat, but this may be a frustration to some. I will add that the feet are really nice. They're made of metal and have a chrome finish and seem to support the TV really well. I've only had cheaper sets with plastic stands in the past.The screen is fairly glossy, but not as bad as others I've seen. If you're planning on having the tv in a brighter room with windows and doing a lot of day time viewing this may be a concern for some. I put the TV in a dark, basement theater room so this isn't a concern for me.The menu is set up well and the tv is very fast and responsive when selecting different menu options. There are a ton of different customization options and the LED light below the SONY logo can be turned completely off or set to only flash when receiving remote commandsI have only 1 gripe with this tv and it's a very small one. The tv does exhibit some flashlighting effect (over-brightness of the led backlighting in the corners) during really dark scenes. It's usually not bad at all and I don't mind it because 99% of the time it's just during credits or an occasional dark scene, but it is visible to me even with the backlighting turned down. None of my friends or family even noticed it until I pointed it out to them, but this could be a concern for picky home theater types.  If the screen goes completely black during a movie this tv seems to turn the backlights completely off (I first thought I'd bumped something the first couple times it happened and powered it off because my older tvs all leave them on when this happens). Now that I'm used to it I love it because the room truly goes fully dark when the movie intends darkness, but if there's anything visible during a black scene some flashlighting will be observed.Overall I love this TV and I highly recommend it especially now that the price has dropped!!! I've read a lot about people being hesitant to buy because they can't find the tv displayed anywhere and are concerned about the curved screen, but like I said above it's a very subtle curve and I can't imagine most people being too concerned with it. It's really nice!"],["good picture, fast set up, fast internetbut heavy 106 lbs, and very thick for a now T Vit is a good T V, but if you expecting it to wow, you will be disappoint.compare to my old 2010 58vt25 Panasonic(broked by my 3yrs old son)I like the Panasonic betterThe reason I bought this T V is: passive 3D, curved, testing out sony"],["We have upgraded from a 4 year old Toshiba LCD, which is still working great. We first tried Samsung 7100 and though the picture quality was good but it was not consistent as some movies seems to be washed out and required changes to the settings.  Also, the color depth and quality was not as good as my old Toshiba. I had to think twice before returning because the picture clarity and 3D were amazing but didn't like the idea of frequently changing the settings to the liking. With my old LCD, all I do is change the mode but there was ever a need to change the settings.  As we were happy with our old Toshiba, and based on the good reviews, we tried 7350 series. Though the ratings were good but we were not impressed especially when compared to 7100. Coincidentally, during that time, the price of this model came down by $1000, which was still a stretch but we went ahead for the following reasons -Curved LCD - we checked in person as well in a local store.Passive 3D &#8211; Watching active 3D for more than 2 hours caused strainSony picture quality &#8211; review ratings for the similar high end model were very good.It has been a day, and so far we are very much impressed with the TV. It is better than 7100 for sure, and Passive 3D is amazing - I did not find any difference in resolution  between this and Samsung's active 3D, and on the contrary Passive seems to be better as the images do pop out more and image does not seem to shrunk that much.I was little skeptical in the beginning, as there were not many reviews of this model, and whatever reviews that are available on the internet questioned the need for a curve TV. Curve in this TV is very minimal and gives a very good feel and appeal.  The only downside with this TV is the weight - it is very heavy but the build quality is unquestionably the best.I benefited from all the reviews so I hope this review would help folks who are interested at this TV. Also, I purchased this TV directly from Sony store as I got additional discount.I will update later if I find any issues and/or my impression changes.Good luck."],["Excellent hdtv.

In particular I liked the rich, clear bass and that was the result of having a reasonably large rear-facing woofer. Also, there is plenty of volume if you want to move this outdoors occasionally.EASY SETUP:  Setup was a snap.  If your router has a button labeled \"WPS\" you won't need a computer, iDevice, or special app.  Just plug in the speaker, wait a couple minutes for a little green light on the to stop flashing and go out,  push the button ON THE SPEAKER marked \"WPS, then go quick as a bunny (you have 90 seconds) to your router and push its WPS button.  That's it... it's done.  You'll probably want to have the speaker close to your router for that two-button setup and afterwards you can move it ALMOST anywhere within WiFi range and it will work fine.PLACEMENT LIMITATIONS:  That \"almost anywhere\" is the minor annoyance.  For example, it would be inconvenient to put this speaker on top of a book shelf in the corner of my office.  The speaker \"goes to sleep\" after 20 minutes of inactivity.  If you want to wake it up you have to press the power button, located on the top of the speaker, and wait about 30 seconds for it to reconnect to your network.  That means, at a minimum you need to touch the speaker every time you want to use it and also that you absolutely have to place it somewhere you can reach easily.  To me, the speaker would be perfect if it had an option that allowed it to stay on all the time.EASY UPDATES:  The good news is it is very easy to update the speaker firmware.  There's a green light (on top so you have to be able to see it) that goes on when there's an update available and a button to press to accept and install it.  Maybe Sony will read this review and consider providing an update that eliminates the \"go to sleep\" mode and allows the speaker to stay on all the time.  Also useful would be an update that allows the speaker to automatically accept and install updates since I can't think of any reason why someone would not want them installed.  Also having to look at the light is another factor that limits where you can put the speaker."],["Iphone users who upgrade their phones to ios 6.1.2 (March 2013) will discover that this device no longer works with your iPhone and after calling Sony's technical support, customer support, customer relations, and national customer relations, I've been told Sony doesn't have a solution (and doesn't know when it will be resolving the problem). I also had a problem with AirPlay draining my iPhone battery (even when I was not playing music) and decided it was better to remove the Sony software from my iPhone and just plugging it directly into the docking station... but now even this approach doesn't work.  I truly love Sony products, but this one doesn't measure up."],["This is a really great sounding iPod speaker dock. The sound is crisp and clear, even when you turn up the volume. This is also a great looking unit, very classy and it puts out great sound from thumping bass to high octave. The control buttons are conveniently located on the top, not the side and not the bottom, but on the top to make for ease of controlling on the unit. My other dock speaker has the controls on the lower side and they are a little hard to get to but his one, has the on/off, volume on the very top rim as well as the connectivity indicator lights. Another cool function of this first rate system is the docking station itself, it pops open and the dock slides out and can be pushed back in when not in use and it can be used without taking off the iPod case (brilliant).This is a really nice looking speaker with great sound. For those of you looking for a dock/stereo that puts out some great sound, this is it. I am totally into listening to Radio Classics on Sirius Radio, and man, this unit plays those old shows brilliantly with great clarity. I love it for music and the old radio shows that I love to listen to while I am working around the house. The classic radio shows can be a little hard to hear sometimes, but this speaker actually reduces the distortions and makes the shows a joy to listen to with crisp, clear sounds-very cool.The Sony RDPXA700iP also has it's own special app that includes an alarm with functions such as a dim feature that makes it nice to use at night. I have another dock that didn't really dim and made the alarm tricky to use. I had to face the iPod away from me to sleep because it was bright. Also included is a remote which allows one to control the speaker without using the dock. It's a small remote, but it does the trick and the wireless connectivity is cool. You can set this up in less than ten minutes. We've been listening to the music and recording ourselves with the iPod on the dock and having a blast. If you have an iPod, or for even better screen enjoyment, an iPad - you can watch movies and enjoy the excellent sound.I also like the audio in which lets me hook up my PC, and watch videos/listen to the music on my PC while listening to them on the speaker as well. The wireless feature also allows you to access your iTunes and play your content from your iPod wirelessly as well.All is all this is a wonderful and technologically advanced system with a lot of versatility for those who own iPods, iPhones and iPads. The way it sounds and the way it's made makes it way above the average dock/stereo."],["This Sony speaker dock works well when playing loud, highly compressed rock music. Sometimes, though, I have to hear a bit of the old Ludwig Van Beethoven. Classical music, or any music that is recorded at a rather low (uncompressed) level, or, shall I say, soft music, does not play well on this unit. When played at a low volume, soft music tends to wind up as static on the upper left speaker of this device. Turn up the volume and it seems to correct itself of this defect...but the neighbors and wife may tend to complain about the loudness level. In short, this speaker dock would be great for brain-damaged teens who listen to Van Halen at decibel levels which will cause a nuclear melt-down of one's tympanic membranes. If you, on the other hand, prefer Van Cliburn playing a quiet piano sonata, don't buy this device. I returned it. By the way, I tried it with several i-pods and an i-phone 5...they all sounded similar and had the same problem as described above. I physically docked all of them too...didn't even attempt to use the air-wave wi-fi doo-hickey fancy stuff. My little theory: spend hours getting that to work and be so elated when you succeed that you don't notice the actual music quality..."],["Let me start by saying that I have a Bose docking station, which I've used for many years.  I was looking for a second docking system, but wanted something besides Bose.  I did my homework on the internet, and discovered this Sony system.  It has great reviews, and Amazon as always has the best prices around!  This system actually sounds better than the Bose.  It has more treble and the bass is sufficiently deep.  In short, it is the best all-around docking system.  With a new iPod, I downloaded my music library, and I am set for musical enjoyment.  Thank you Amazon again for a great product and a great price!"],["The new generation of airplay devices have really improved and this unit definitely is super easy to set up compared to older models. Plug your phone in, download the app and the rest is easy. Great, full sound - exactly what you expect from Sony. The solid triangle body feels well made and definitely won't fall over or off a table or ledge. The ONLY thing I don't like is that the unit turns itself off after periods of non-use. That means I have to go over to it to turn it on before streaming music from my computer that is in a different room. That's a bummer. I'd rather it stay on.  I still give it five stars because the sound is so good and it's well made. Fortunately there is a remote and I've been using that since I have it on a high shelf to control volume.I'm hoping they send out an update to fix the power time-out - apparently it's set to realize this on it's own. I'll update if that ever happens."],["I received this fantastic speaker dock yesterday and I have been playing with it ever since. It is a very modern, unobtrusive, clean looking unit.Let me start by saying that I may be one of the least tech savvy people in America. I love my iPhone and appreciate that it is super easy to use. This Sony Dock is even easier.I unpacked it, plugged it in, and placed my phone on it. It notified me that I needed an app to use the dock. The free app downloaded rapidly and without incident using our podunk country WiFi.The dock opened soundlessly and my phone dropped right in.  I played with different types of music, from rock with lots of bass to my husband's favorite instrumental music and was amazed at the clarity, no matter what the volume. And it has VOLUME!!I was thrilled to find out that that my phone was charging while it was playing. (I SAID I'm not tech smart! LOL!)The unit also comes with a pretty basic remote that was also easy to use.The price is rather high, but the sound and ease of use makes it well worth it. This really is one of those rare products that deserve all five stars!"],["I have been doing some serious research on what speaker to buy.  Actually purchased a few and really tried to like them, but the sound on both just didn't please me.  Started search on what to buy next.  This speaker caught my eye and it seemed to have great reviews.  Price was a little more than I had planned on paying, but with more research, found a great price.  I have to say, this speaker sounds great.  One speaker I had, the bass was so heavy that you couldn't hear anything else.  It had such a muddy sound.  The other one had absolutely no bass.  This speaker has strong bass but it doesn't overtake the highs.  I'm so happy with my purchase."],["When you live in a world with hundreds of millions of iPhones, iPods, and iPads storing massive quantities of music not only on those devices but also in iCloud, it stands to reason that the companies that built the equipment for the LPs, CDs and cassettes would be looking for a way to get the sound away from those tiny little music machines and into something that can fill a room with deep and rich sound.The RDPXA700IP (does't that name just roll off your tongue?) is one of Sony's several attempts to grab a piece of the new industry standard. Too a large extent, Sony succeeds  Setup is easy, even though it has no LED interface like thePioneer X-SMC3-S Music Tap AirPlay Music System (Black), which is another excellent choice.The Sony sound is legendary, and this device will not disappoint you, dispute its compact size. It fills the room with clean and distortion-free music that will be more than acceptable in dorm rooms, living rooms and on patios. The Pioneer unit is larger but size does't guarantee richness.As an AirPlay device, you can play music from your iPhone, iPod, or iPhone without inserting the iOS device directly into the dock. Although it is technically compatible with iPad, the potential for damage to the port or the dock connector is much higher because of its scale.This would be a great gift for the college-bound grad or even Dad on Father's Day."],["We love our new RDP-XA700IP, and listen to it every day. It sounds fantastic.The style and form factor are great, and the sounds is superb. The iOS app to configure/manage it is kind of lame, but you don't really need it so that's fine. Make sure you read the instructions and set it up for network standby.  That way you can always turn it on with your iOS device, and don't have to touch the speaker.* Edit one year later *I can no longer recommend this device.  We pampered and gently used this device. However, after 13 months of use it stopped working.  It now only emits a screech when trying to airplay.  I attempted a factory reset, and now it is unable to connect to the network.  The D-Sappli application no longer works with the device.  Sony says I'm out of luck, and offers to exchange it for a price higher than the new devices are selling for."],["I have the RDPX500IP which is the same thing but without the airplay feature.This thing looks great and sounds great. I compared it to the Beats by Dre dock and a couple of the Bose docks and this one sounded the best. Clear highs and nice lows without sounding muddy or harsh. Are there better docs out there? Sure. The B&W; Zepplin and the Bang & Olufson docks sound and look way better but also cost 2-4x as much. Not worth it. This sony dock did the trick for me. Great sound and design at a great price."],["This speaker delivers excellent sound in a very reasonably sized package.  A melodic guitar solo sounded so real, I could hear every pluck of the strings.  This is the best-sounding iPhone dock speaker that I've ever had the pleasure of using.PROs+ Excellent sound quality.+ Reasonably small.+ Attractive design with retractable dock connector to keep things sleek.+ AirPlay audio is easy to setup and works well.CONs- Big external power brick.SETUPIf you are going to dock your Apple iPod/iPhone/iPad, setup is as simple as \"ejecting\" the hidden dock retractor and docking your device.  I tested with an iPhone 4 with the Apple bumper installed and the fit was excellent.  Many dock connectors are not compatible with the iPhone bumper but that is not the problem with this unit.The one-time setup of adding this to your wireless network for AirPlay was very easy.  I used the \"WPS\" feature of the speaker which allowed me to join the speaker to my secured Wifi network by just pushing a button on the speaker and then the matching WPS button on my wifi router.  I didn't have to do anything after that except to wait a minute or so.  You only have to do this setup once but I'm pleased to say that Sony made it very easy.  I think most people will be able to figure this out.SOUND QUALITYI was impressed with the quality of this speaker.  Highs were crisp, bass was strong and clear without being muddy.  As for volume, it is able to play painfully loud in a bedroom-sized room.  I think the sound quality is the biggest win with this product.  I enjoy listening to it every time I use it.D-Sappli iOS APPI downloaded Sony's free D-Sappli app from the Apple app store.  When my phone is docked, I can run this app and have my dock act like a semi-intelligent alarm clock.  You can setup a range of times for it to play (start time, end time, and list of songs).  You can also set it to perform a sleep function where it will play for 15+ minutes and then go silent.There is also an equalizer feature available that lets you choose from sound presets like \"Rock\".  It works well and may help you improve audio depending on your personal preferences.APPEARANCEThis unit has clean lines and a rounded triangular form.  It is mostly black with a small stainless-steel-look bezel on the top and a retractable dock connector.  The retractable connector allows it to look great even when you're not connecting your iPhone through the dock.  I was pleased with the appearance and would have no problem putting this in a prominent location.MISCELLANEOUSThe unit comes with an obligatory minuscule remote control that you will probably lose.  It also comes with a huge power brick that somewhat disappointed me.  I suppose you can hide the brick behind it but it is about the size of a brick for a small laptop.  The power brick is my only minor gripe about this speaker.An annoying feature of this unit is the auto-off feature that happens after 20 minutes of non-use.  I later learned that this can be avoided by configure the speaker to go into \"network standby\".  That made my enjoyment of this speaker so much higher!  I can't believe \"network standby\" isn't the default setting.SUMMARYIf you're ok with dropping nearly $400 on a speaker, this is definitely one to consider.  It undercuts the Bose SoundDock-10 and the B&W; Zeppelin by more than $100 yet still delivers excellent sound quality.  If the unit had bluetooth and a battery it would be close to the ultimate dock speaker."],["I originally purchased a RDP-X200IP on sale for $169.00 at Target. My wife and I were impressed by the overall sound. However, after reading some reviews and takinga close look at the specs that the RDPXA700IP had,I decided to return the 200IPand order the 700IP.The 700 IP has a richer sound, especially if you like the sound of \"rich\" bass.I turned the bass boost off on the 200ip because the bass sounded distorted. This is not case with the 700 IP.Also the 700 IP is very user friendly. I intalled the D-Sappli app which is the free wirelss app,and it works very well. One caveat here;thesound \"quality\" SEEMS to drop of just a little when the music is streamed wirelesslyversus when the ipod or phone is actually docked to the unit.I was fortunate enough to purchase the unit online for $264.00 tax and shipping.I would find it suprising if there is a better sounding dock remotely close to the price I paid.(costccentral.com-$254.00)In conclussion I have no regrets and anyone shopping the Bose Sound dock 10 for $500.00 should consider this unit."],["I've been listening to this speaker system for a few hours now, and I'm rather pleased. It's well designed speaker system that matches the aesthetics of your iDevice.Setup:The setup took less than 5 minutes. It does require the download of a Sony app called D-Sappli. Your iDevice must be connected to your WiFi network (if you're not using WPS, which no one seems like they use) and the app will transfer the WiFi's SSID from the iDevice while it's plugged into the dock. Enter your password, and you're done. It wasn't as clean as installing my Philips Airplay speakers, but painless nonetheless.Airplay works great. My WiFi network pretty much runs at full throttle all day long and there's no hiccups. I tried this off of two computers, an iPad and an iPod Touch.Aesthetics:There's a speaker dock that you can drop your iDevice into. It's \"hidden\" in the body of the dock so by pressing it in, it soft ejects out so you can drop your device in and play music. It will also charge your device, which is great. It's very minimalist.Sound:This Sony speaker dock can get pretty loud with no distortion. I ran this through the most bass-thumping music I had and it was flawless. Same with classical - I was able to feel the cello's vibrations. It was pretty slick.Other:The Sony RDPXA700iP comes with a remote that's pretty basic. You're able to control any of your audio sources (iPod, audio in, Airplay) and switch between them. On the back of the speaker dock itself, there's an Ethernet plug along with a line-in jack (no cable included in the box).The D-Sappli (who came up with this name?) app is pretty cool - it'll also function as an alarm and for your iDevice. It also allows for EQ control and more from the speaker to tweak your music.Overall this is a very impressive device, albeit pricy. But it's well worth it and makes for a great addition if you're invested in the Apple ecosystem."],["Excellent value,prompt delivery,as advertised!"],["It was everything i was expecting. Impressive sound, nice design, easy to use. My son is happy to have it for his birthday present."],["Right out of the box, this portable speaker dock from Sony impresses with its sleek, sturdy design. Once I plugged in my iPod I was further impressed by the unit's rich, room-filling sound. Considering the compact size the sound is comparable to that of a much larger stereo system, and it sounds good just about anywhere you choose to put it in a room. One small qualm I have with it is the apparent lack of any customizable equalizer settings, since the bass can get a bit \"boomy,\" but this is a relatively minor drawback and generally speaking the unit's tone is very impressive. In addition to playing your iPod or iPhone, the unit also offers the option to play directly off of iTunes from your computer via a wi-fi connection. Unfortunately I was unable to use this feature in my home, but it seems very appealing and I imagine it's a great function for a lot of people. If nothing else, the unit includes an 8\" output jack that could very easily be attached to one's computer and used simply as a very nice speaker system. Considering this versatile functionality, I find very little not to recommend about the Sony RD-PXA700iP."],["This is a very nice speaker, producing rich tones from your digital music.Like many speakers, it will also charge your iPod or iPhone, but the real difference maker is the Airplay technology, so that it can play music off a computer's iTunes, iPad, or iPod through a wireless network.When an iPod is placed on the charging tray, the remote control allows you to change songs and volume easily, and the remote is small so it takes up little space.One thing to be aware of is that older iPods may not work.  I tried an older wheel-based iPod (5th Gen) and it is not compatible, although an iPod classic is supposed to be.  Before you put down money, make sure your iPod is compatible, or else you will end up plugging it into the Input jack, which works great, but won't charge the MP3 player or allow use of the remote.All told this is a VERY nice speaker dock, and it will provide you with great sound."],["This unit must be heard to be believed. Its well-balanced sound (great highs and mids, superior tight bass) is better than units costing $100-300 more. I know, I have exhausted most of them (Bose, B&W;, Pioneer, as well as Big Jambox) over the past week. Wifi network setup could not have been easier. Airplay is clear and stable. It works great with my iPhone 5 (iOS 6) using a lightning adapter.  I even like the minimalist alarm feature on the App.1 big tip for folks who buy this...As another reviewer mentioned, this unit has a \"network standby\" feature that will allow airplay devices to wake the unit up after it goes to sleep. Just press and hold the power button for a few seconds.

Live view works well but is not easily seen in bright light....but the articulated screen does help in this.  The burst option is excellent giving up to 10fps BUT the time to write these to the memory card (even class 10) is a little slow & you cannot use the camera again until it has finished.

Being that I am just getting into it I didn't want to spend a fortune on a camera and equipment. So I did quite a bit of research on features I wanted, and features I could live without, as well as the price point I was comfortable with. I finally settled on the Canon T3. I t seemed like a good entry level camera that wouldn't break the bank. So, most of this review will be comparing the Sony Alpha SLT-A37K with the Canon T3 as that is what I am most familiar with and feature wise they are pretty close.If you are like me, then the advanced functions of an camera scare the crap out of you. Both the Canon and the Sony have a bevy of advanced functions, but to be honest if I looked at them funny I'd probably destroy half the universe so I'll leave them alone. Which brings us to the preset functions on each dial. For all intensive purposes both cameras are near identical in preset photo modes.Portrait, landscape, sport, etc. I tried my best to take comparative photo's with both cameras in as identical conditions as I could. The end results were mostly what I was expecting. For most modes the pictures between the two cameras were largely identical. However, the Sony had a slight edge when taking pictures in the \"Sport\" or fast moving mode. Not that the Canon was bad, but the Sony seemed to have just a touch more clarity and a degree or two of better constant focus. This was most noticeable when taking pictures of frisbee dogs in action, and even a tad more noticeable when accessing those pictures in a photo editing software.Another thing I noticed is when using a Class 4 memory card in the Sony the pictures had a much longer write time to the card than when using a Class 10 card. Granted, this is to be expected, but it was a considerable difference between the write speed of a Class 4 card in the Canon. Picture quality was unchanged, but with the slow down you are unable to get \"sequence\" shots as quick as you may like them.Both the Canon T3 and the Sony claim to record HD Video. In theory it's a great feature, but in my experience both cameras produced only passable in video quality. This could very well be a case of me not being familiar enough with the camera, settings, etc. The Canon had decent lighting, shake reduction, and frame rate - but the actual image quality was nothing to write home to mom about. The Sony on the other hand had good lighting, decent image quality but, even with the use of a tripod, had an annoying amount of camera shake during replay of the video. Software was able to correct some, but some remained as well.In terms of feel and build the Sony feels just a little heavier with battery, lens, memory card than the comparable setup with the Canon. Some equate weight to quality, but when you are lugging a camera around all day to take pictures sometimes that weight becomes more of a hindrance. Granted, there is not a huge degree of difference here.Battery life is hard to measure. In my totally \"un\"scientific experiment both candles were about equal. It did seem when taking sequence action shots that the Canon died a little more quickly but it was such a negligible difference it shouldn't impact most users.With allt hat said, which one is better? Honestly, I have no idea. They are both (in my opinion) really good entry level cameras. I think it comes down to price and which brand you prefer. At the time of this review the Canon T3 is a little cheaper than the Sony. Keep in mind if you are investing in a camera make sure to price out the lens and accessories you would want as well. In my humble opinion you can't go wrong with either camera. But, if you are looking for a camera that takes good to great video as well, you may be better served going a step up from both of the ones I mentioned in this review."],["Very nice camera. It is very accurate and light. It has a function so usefull: u can shoot at night without tripoid and the camera shoots three picture and process it to obtain a very nice picture."],["Bought as upgrade to a 330a, works like I expected. Love the lens! I don't understand why SONY is not more popular."],["I owned the Sony A200, then the Sony A700. So i wanted to get the A37, which is one ont the new line of Sony DSLR cameras.I chose the A37, over the A57 or A65 because it claimed to have the SAME sensor and the SAME image processor. At first i love its great image quality, no noise in low light. However the shutter botton felt so flimsy.I didn't like its shutter lag.[...]Once auto focus occurs, release time lag is the delay between fully pressing the shutter release and when the camera actually starts taking the picture. Long lag makes it harder to capture fast-moving objects.I don't know if this is because its poor focus performance, in both indoor and outdoor in a sunny day.Some reviwers have also complain about this too. So slow to focus.Battery is smaller than A200 ( which is an entry level camera too). The A200  focused faster than A37. So i was able to take pictures faster than with this one. With the A37 the time relay between shots was about 2-3 seconds. I don't know if i will switch to Canon or stick with Sony, but now i would better get the A65. If i would have the money i would get the A77 if was to get a Sony.When you turn the dial mode to either, P,A,S, or M. The camera tells you what all those modes are for. This is something i find innecessary. If you are getting this kind of camera you are suppoused to know what are all this modes for.It was so hard to make a decision, but i finally decided to return it.

Sony Alpha cameras can also use older Minolta A-Mount lenses. There are a ton of these old lenses out there so if you are just starting this won't break the bank5. Fast Auto focusing6. Built in autofocusing mechanism on the camera body7. Built in image stability (SuperSteadyShot) on the camera body instead of the lenses8. Able to take videos as wellCons:1. Noise on picture at higher ISO (usable but if you pixel-peep then you might be disappointed)2. Not a lot of support from local camera shops (atleast in my area they cater to Nikon's and Canon's mostly)3. Hot shoe on camera is not a common design so finding a hot shoe flash might be an issue for you.4. Poor Lowlight performance if you pixel-peep but the pictures are still usable."],["SO THE HOLIDAYS WERE HERE, AGAIN, IN ANOTHER NEW ENGLAND TOWN. LIVING WITH-OUT A DIGITAL CAMERA WAS PAINFUL AND SOME WHAT UNPREDICTABLE. AS I WENT TO SCHOOL AS A DARK ROOM SPECIALIST, BUT NEVER FINISHED MY DEGREE. I AM THANKFUL FOR HAVING THIS CAMERA FALL INTO MY HANDS... LOVE LOVE LOVE IT..Five stars for this wonderful device. Worth the money and the credit debt that i some how fell into because of this camera.Where do I start?"],["I am a owner or a Alpha A100, so when new travel plans were being made I objected to taking both a super-zoom camera and the DSLR for scenery shots.  The compromise was to get the A37 with the 18-135 zoom.  The video looks good compared to my Panasonic FZ35 video, plus there is no tendency to blow highlights in bright sun like with a smaller sensor.  The 18-135 zoom performs great with video and can barely be heard in playback. Some of my older Minolta lenses make quite a racket in comparison.  I am happy with the ISO 1600 results with this camera, and I find the ISO 3200 results to be less objectionable than my Sony A100's ISO 1600 results.  Hey the weight of the camera with the 18-135 is not to bad, especially compared to my A100 DSLR which feels too heavy after using the A37 for a while.  A key consideration when hauling a camera around all day.The LCD is just OK, its viewing angle is poor to the similar LCD (both size and resolution) of the A100.  However the tilt feature makes this mostly a non-issue.  The EVF is huge compared to the viewfinder of the A100, and is better suited for shooting in dim situations.  I bright sunlight, you need to press you eye firmly against the EVF to be able to see, it is noticeably dimmer than the optical viewfinders of other cameras.  The EVF will surprise you sometimes, because it is what you see is what you get.  I remember scratching my head at the blue outdoors scenery out a window when the main lighting was incandescent.  I thought for a second and realized that is exactly the result when I would take a picture with my DSLR, but not at all what I would see through the optical viewfinder.  This camera is 100% live view all of the time, and the shot to shot speed doesn't suffer for it one bit.The buffer size is small, like by old Sony A100, but I was surprised how fast the shot to shot speed was.  I was accidently in continuous mode and shot 3 frames in slightly more time than my old DSLR could take one picture.  Pretty quick in comparison."],["Took this camera on vacation to Disney World. The camera took amazing pictures. Everything from bright sun to night time fireworks came out perfect. You don't have to be a expert to use this camera  I used the auto setting and the pictures came out perfect. I love this camera and couldn't be more satisfied with it."],["The new Sony camera has so many really nice features. Like a computer with lenses in your hand. Am learning  all the ins and outs of it  but so far it has taken excellent pictures. A, very pleased."],["I have two of these cameras and I would not part with them for anything. Well almost anything. Lightning&#65279; fast focus, lightweight and compact body.

It's my first DSLR (DSLT). I have been  mostly using it for video. It takes great 1080p AVCHD video as well as any professional camcorder. I'm impressed with the built in stereo mic, but equally impressed with the stereo microphone input jack that allows me to connect a shotgun mic. It's small, lite and easy to handle. Even with a 200mm lense, a dual mount bracket, (shotgun mic.), light, and lens hood; it's still light enough to mount on a decent consumer tripod."],["I'm just testing it. But until now, this is the best camera ever. Great pictures, not too much weight. Y have the award of innovation in 2012. 200% recommended"],["I'm really enjoying this camera.  I upgraded from Nikon D40 which I had for over 5 years, so the differences are obvious.  Only thing that is a bit different and harder to get used to is the fact that through the eye hole you actually see a video and not a mirror image like I'm used to - BUT the benefit of that is that Sony lets you play with the different parameters (shutter speed, etc.) and actually shows you if you got it right before you snap a photo.  That's nice because previously I've had to take a few shots before being sure I got the shutter speed or aperture right.  Overall, I love it!"],["I really like this camera, though I don't have much to compare it too.  I have a nice sony cybershot and a couple old film SLR cameras.  My brother who had a canon 2Ti was pretty impressed with it and though it better than the canon, not better than his 5d mk 2, but that's not a real comparison.  Wish it had more custom function buttons and a better directional button for when choosing an AF point.  Seems sad that it's already discontinued but that's the world of technology.  The lack of an IR sensor for a wireless remote is also a big let down but one I can compromise on. ISO is great and in camera HDR processing is a plus.  The burst mode is pretty quick and produces decent pics.  It's a great intro camera I believe and happy I went with itupdate:  The battery life is a big let down, will be picking up another one.  Still really enjoy the 18-55 kit that came with mine.  Added a decent hoya circular polarizer and got rid of the skylight filter I had on it.  Also just picked up a tamron 70-300 and it is fantastic on this camera."],["I recently had the opportunity to test the Sony Alpha A37 (SLT-A37) with the Sony 18-55mm lens.  As an avid life-long Nikon Shooter, I welcomed the opportunity to try another \"non-pro\" brand, specifically the Sony Alpha series, which seems highly regarded by amateurs and even advanced amateurs.  My review and rating of the A37 is based on the camera within its own class as opposed to an unfair comparison to a Nikon D300s or D800 for example, which are priced much higher and target a different shooter group with different needs.  Please note Sony's designation of SLT indicates replacement of the optical viewfinder with an electronic one and relies upon a translucent mirror.  This is a major differentiation to DSLR's.The Sony Alpha A37 is best described as an advanced entry level DSLR camera. At $600 (I expect a minor 5% price drop in the future) with the Sony 18-55mm lens, it represents a great way for shooters to enter into the DSLR range or expand from lower ranked DSLR camera and is priced lowest in the Sony Alpha line.  But, as with most brands, you are committing to specific branded lenses; in this case, Sony and Minolta \"A-mount\" lenses.  This is not necessarily bad because you will save thousands of dollars when compared to Nikon or Canon.  I am not aware of any converters allowing use of Nikon or Canon branded lenses.  But, out of the box, you get everything you need including the 18-55mm lens, which would provide most people most of the focal length they need in day to day use, as well as on-camera flash, charger (wall type), battery, strap, and Sony Software. At the wide end of the included 18-55mm lens, the end most used by casual shooters, you have the ability to get creative out of the box- a big plus in today's economy.Highlights of the A-37 Feature Set-New 16.1 mp CMOS Sensor-100% viewfinder coverage-Intelligent pixel upscaling-ISO 100-16000-Onboard picture effects processing-1080p 24/60i HD AVCHD format video-Dedicated stereo microphone and mic input-7 frames per second burst rate (reduced 8.4mp resolution rate)-On camera stabilizationFor prior Sony A35 shooters, Dpreview notes: \"the changes are subtle - the A37 gains the A57's improved viewfinder optics, and it becomes the only SLT not to shoot 60p video - instead offering 60i and 24p as its highest frame rate options, both at 24Mbps. The A35's continuous shooting rates are unchanged, with the camera offering 7 frame-per-second bursts at reduced resolution (8.4MP) in a mainly automated mode.\"  I felt it important to include this information as I did not own any other Sony Alpha cameras for comparison.\"I tested the camera in controlled indoor conditions as I first test all my Nikon cameras prior to field use.  To say I was impressed would be an understatement. I found the camera very ergonomic and well balanced, thus easy to hold at about a combined 25 ounces with the 18-55 attached. Of course, it does not have the build quality of a Nikon D300s or D700.  But, that's not the point at a $1,200 to $2,200 difference.  Of particular note to existing Sony Alpha line shooters is the significant size difference between the much larger A57 ($800) and the A37.  This lends the A37 more ergonomic to women with smaller hands.  The manual controls on the camera, primarily within range of the right thumb when shooting, are mostly easily accessible and intuitive, providing a higher degree of non-menu driven manual exposure control.Impressive with this camera is the 100% electronic viewfinder coverage at 1.09 magnification, a differentiation among pros-level cameras as I know very few serious shooters willing to shoot with less than 100% viewfinder coverage, myself included. Live-view (no virtual horizon on this model), available on the Sony A37, is a much hyped feature.  However, as a portrait photographer, I never found practical use for it on any of my Nikons though landscape and macro shooters will undoubtedly use such a feature.  The camera's 15-point autofocus system is arranged towards the center in sharp comparison to my Nikon usage. The autofocus system can be set to single, continuous or automatic - a hybrid of the two that responds only when it senses subject movement.  Thanks to the design focusing is very fast, especially for an entry level camera at this price point.  On continuous autofocus, the A37 really shines. Image quality is superb with adequate detail in shadows. Of incredible importance, though understated in the literature is the RAW shooting ability of the camera that translates will with Adobe Camera Raw (ACR) if needed.  The A37's ISO 100-16,000 equivalent range is exceptional at lower ISO settings and still good OK at ISO 1600. At ISO 6400 detail becomes smudged and process-sharpened edges show as artifacts. ISO 12,800-16,000 do not have practical use in my opinion except for emergency situations with no other alternative.Another impressive feature that worked in my tests is the \"Steady Shot INSIDE\" (like Nikon VR or Canon IS on their respective lenses). Unlike the larger DLSR makers, Sony built stabilization inside the camera as opposed to lenses. This provides stabilization regardless of the lens type and ultimately at reduced cost. The A37 also incorporates Sony's proprietary Translucent Mirror Technology, eliminating the need to raise and lower the mirror, providing fast continuous shooting at speeds of up to 10 fps in Continuous Priority AE mode.  This speed really pushes Sony out ahead in its class and price range.Not impressive is the rear 2.7 inch screen at 230k resolution.  While most pro's don't rely on the rear screen to check exposure, most amateurs do. Such a small screen at this resolution does not provide a good method in this regard. But to be honest, even checking a Nikon rear screen in broad daylight can be difficult. Also not impressive, though not unexpected, is Sony's continued reliance on its proprietary hot shoe and memory cards. Not a big deal if you stay vested in the line/ brand.As for video performance, I will have to leave a detailed review to other reviewers since I rarely shoot video.In conclusion, the Sony A37 hits the mark for the intended audience.  It will provide good performance in typical shooting scenarios of amateurs. However, as you move into the creative realm of photography (think fashion and fine art), you will encounter some difficulty pushing the gear envelope. At higher ISO's you will experience significant noise and will need to move to prime or fast lenses and flash to get the ISO down. Frame rate bursts are reduced when shooting RAW and the rear screen leaves a lot to be desired in terms of resolution.  The camera also tends to underexpose, which is no big deal really- except to die hard exposure fanatics.  But once again, at this price point the camera is a very solid buy for amateurs and allows expansion into more advanced Sony Alpha cameras."],["I need a camera for low light and after reading many reviews, I was ready to purchase the Sony SLT-A37 but then I came across the following review. Although this is not my review, it is a review from a verified buyer on another site......someone who has purchased and used the camera, and therefore I think it is not out of place being presented along with rest of these reviews. The A37 he bought came with the 18-55mm zoom lens. Does anyone care to comment on his experience with this camera?Flawed GemThe Sony SLT-A37 has very good hardware and generally produces very good pictures. You can find several good reviews that present this and the camera's other strengths, such as its fast autofocus. I will instead mention an important shortcoming that you should know before you buy.In Program mode, the camera uses a minimum shutter speed of 1/60s and a maximum aperture of f/4.0 even in low light, even at the 18mm end of its kit lens, preferring to instead increase the ISO sensitivity instead. It is only after it reaches an ISO setting of 3200 that it reduces the shutter speed and opens the aperture further. This means that in low light it takes pictures at much higher ISO settings than it needs to and the pictures come out looking much worse than they need to. This also means that its in-body image stabilization provides no benefit and is only a marketing spec. There is no way to change or customize this behavior.You can try to overcome this limitation by shooting in Manual mode and selecting the shutter speed and aperture that is needed. However, then you will run into its second major limitation: there is no option for Auto ISO in Manual mode. That means you will have to select all settings manually for every shot, which is impractical if you plan to take more than a few, well composed pictures. After I encountered this limitation, I did some googling and apparently Sony is the only major camera maker that refuses to provide this simple feature. Nikon, Canon, Pentax, Olympus, etc all have this option in their DSLR or mirrorless offerings.Together, these limitations mean that this camera's performance in low light is simply unacceptable. Since this was the reason why I had bought it, I had to send it back. If low light performance is at all important for you, I suggest you look elsewhere. If you plan to shoot only in bright daylight, this camera will do a good job.No, I would not recommend this to a friend"],["Unfortunately for me, last week I mistakingly returned this outstanding entry level DSLR, model Alpha SLT-A37K, because I missed a critical setting in the manual and there was no one at the Big Box store to give me a walk-thru before I took it home. Add to that, the fact that I only had a few days to return it if I disliked it, and this greatly limited by ability to thoroughly learn and discover all of it's features. This camera has several options when it comes to the size of the focus area it uses on your subject and my test camera was apparently set to a very small focus area to allow blurring of the backgrounds, ideal for portraits. Had I realized this, I probably would have gotten excellent picture results and kept the camera. For this reason, I am upgrading my rating to 4 stars and encourage others who are looking for a really nice entry level DSLR to take a closer look at this Sony as its large CMOS sensor is great, especially in low light conditions. I apologize to anyone who read my earlier review and was put off by my misunderstanding of the camera's focus zones."],["Five years ago I sold my Sony DCS-F717 which was a great camera for an all in one and decided to get a DSLR.  I bought the A100 because of the built in image stabilization and the ability to use Minolta lenses. Five years ago it was easy to find Minolta lenses for very low prices as no one was sure Sony would put such a great effort into making an entire line of DSLR's. I started with a 50 mm f1.7. Then I found a 24-85 mm f3.5/4.5 which has become my favorite lens because it's very sharp, relatively light and offers good range. Then I found the 100 mm f2.8 Macro which is a superb lens and was top rated (same rating as the Leica) by Colorfoto (a German magazine) which ran a test on various macro lenses.All of these lenses only cost me a few hundred dollars so buying into the Minolta/Sony A-Mount system is a real bargain compared to Canon/Nikon lenses. I also have the Sony 75-300 mm f4.5/5.6 which is a copy of the Minolta lens. Over the course of the last five years I've discovered that the A100 is too large and heavy to drag around for casual shooting and it's low light performance was limited. Also it doesn't shoot video so I used a Sanyo Xacti HD-1010 as my video camera. I had to decide which was more important. Video with poor quality stills on the Sanyo or high quality stills but no video on the Sony.Recently I started investigating the options. After much research I was all set to buy the new Sony NEX F3. Then I went to look at it and immediately I struggled to read the tiny font and icons. Just about everyone will eventually suffer from Presbyopia which a difficulty to focus on close up objects. This can be easily corrected with reading glasses but I don't want to carry around a set of glasses to take photos. Moreover it means constantly looking up to see distant objects in focus. That's when I decided I still wanted a camera with a viewfinder. But I was still attracted to the size of the Nex which I could use if I bought the optional viewfinder. When shooting videos I loved the accessory microphone input on the Sanyo. Unfortunately the Nex cameras require you to buy one specific Sony microphone. Also NEX cameras use a new E mount lens which means you need an adapter to use A mount lenses. So by the time you buy the viewfinder, the microphone and the mount adapter you've spent twice the price of the camera. Way more than was in my budget. My goal was to sell the A100 and the Sanyo and use the proceeds to buy a new camera.Enter the Sony A37 with Single lens Translucent technology.This is really a huge advance over using a camera with a flip up mirror which was invented in 1949. For the first time Sony has also included all of the features of the higher end cameras in their entry level A37. The A37 is a NEX-F3 in an Alpha SLT format.The size of the A37 is perfect for me. The grip on the A37 has been improved with a deeper groove for your fingers. I tried out the A57. It's much bigger and heavier than the A37. I have to grip really hard to hold it one handed (just like I did with the A100.)  The A37 is much lighter and smaller which means that it fits perfectly in a small camera bag together with a couple of spare lenses. The camera and the 18-55 mm lens weighs just a pound and a half.I mostly use the EVF (which includes diopter correction) but when I need the LCD I have no issues at all with it. Of course, I don't review photos on it. No camera LCD is good enough to reliably do that. The tilt mechanism makes it easy to compose shots that require you to hold the camera above or below you. If you don't use the EVF as your primary composing tool then I would suggest you look at the NEX F3 as it's an otherwise great camera that just lacks the things I want such a built in EVF and support for A mount lenses without an adapter.For $600 my new A37 does everything I want it to do. Great images and videos are just as good as more expensive cameras. I only shoot mp4 videos so the lack of 1080p AVCHD won't be missed. Standard h264 mp4 video is so much easier to edit than AVCHD.The A37 has the 3rd generation of the Bionz processor which is also used in all of the current generation of  SLT and NEX cameras including the flagship model the A77.This new processor allows for better low light shot with an ISO range from 100 to 16,000.In addition the new processor makes possible continuous 15 point phase detection auto focus, 5.5 fps shooting at full resolution and full HD video recording.Together with a 16mp sensor and a good lens such as the 18-55 you have everything you need to take great photos. Features such as clear image zoom that can digitally extend the range of any lens and a viewfinder with 100% coverage are wonderful.Anyone can operate this camera which now has two auto settings; intelligent auto and superior auto which makes it possible for even a beginner to take great photos.Let me know if you have questions and thanks for watching.I'm not a beginner. I've been a photographer for 4 decades and this is the best camera I've ever owned. The A37 is a major upgrade from my previous camera both in image quality and in handling.The 3 things to consider are the processor, the image sensor and the lens. I own 3 Minolta lenses and 2 Sony lenses. They are all good to excellent and that includes the 18-55 'kit' lens. With a new 3rd generation Bionz processor, a 16mp sensor and the 18-55 lens you will have everything you need to take excellent photos.The specs are awesome because this is one awesome camera. Sure Sony has to offer some 'step up' features in other models but they are really nothing essential.You will also have spent less which you can use to buy accessories such as an extra battery, a fast SDHC card and some great used Minolta lenses.These reviews are helpful; [...] Rated Essential.[...]First place.[...] 'I know it seems like I'm \"Mr. Sony is perfect\" but honestly there is very little not to like about this camera at its price point.

The extra $100 for the longer lens is well worth it.  I will probably never need to buy another lens.  Takes outstanding videos.  Better user interface than Canon."],["I own the A100 and A700 from Sony and have found them to be worthwhile cameras with pros and cons like any other brand. Initially I was quite hesitant about getting one of their new mirrorless offerings.Camera came a day later than I expected but hey it was the midst of the holiday season, so no big thing. These comments are not intended to be very technical/professional  but from the viewpoint of a slightly above average user.1. The relatively small size and weight (compared to the A100 and the A700) were a surpise despite the fact that several reviewers mentioned how compact it was. This is a big plus for me since I am getting old and carrying anything the size and weight of an A700 gets to be a burden. The difference in weight may not seem much but to someone with arthritis it is a benefit.I thought about the NEx series and similar from Nikon but I really didn't want to get into changing lens mounts.2. The convenience of built in movie mode cannot be understated. It was no fun carrying around an A700 and a PS to take movies. While certainly not the best movie camera it is heads and shoulders above my trusty PS and the convenience over-rides any loss in quality.3. Image quality is at least equal to the A700 in my opinion. I know this is very subjective and highly dependent on non-camera body factors such as lens and subject etc. But for whatever it's worth I think the A37 offers the same quality photos as the A700.4. There is no doubt the A37 has far more menu choices and modes than the A700 and its generation. The one I found most interesting was the auto panoramic mode. It does work and the stitch quality may not completely please the purist but for most cases it beats the dickens out of manual panorama photography.Besides that I found it to be fairly forgiving since a tripod is not a must have for this to work.5. Burst mode is obviously significantly faster than the older generation of cameras but this is expected. This will be a major plus when I try to shoot pics of my grandkids.6. Battery life is not spectacular but from the relatively small battery on the average I get an estimated 350+ shots. I would say not bad at all.7. The 135mm lens the kit came with for $593 lives uo to the high ratings almost all the reviewers indicated.8. In my opinion it handles low lighting with a bit more ease and accuracy than the A700. Keep in kind I have only had it for  a few weeks.9. I would give the built in flash the edge over the A700 built in flash. More even lighting and seems a tad more powerful. Again, subjective rating not scientifically measured.10. Having the memory card and the battery in one compartment like many other brands makes more sense. I always had to fumble a tad with the A100 and A700 with the double compartments for battery and card.11. The buffer seems to be quite efficient since you can shoot quite a bit before the camera slows down. I would recommend using Class 10 memory cards anyhow. Why spend so much and then use the cheapest memory cards.Cons1. The menu system is confusing at times. However that may be somewhat due to my reluctance to read thru the manual.2. For such a small battery it certainly takes a long time to charge (250 minutes)! My Toshiba Thrive Tablet with a larger wattage takes half that time.3. The LCD viewing screen does not provde an accurate enough preview of your shots. The color seems off and overexposed. Others have berated Sony about this.4. Not sure this is a criticism but the A700 shots with several megapixels less in resolution have larger files sizes than the A37 files. Is this the result of higher JPG compression and a subsequent loss of quality? I don't know. But it does seem curious. Perhaps it is due to more efficient JPG compression software.That's all for now. Maybe I'll update this review after I've ben using it for six months."],["What to say in this review is something that I've had to struggle with a bit.  This camera is my first real entry into the somewhat overwhelming world of Digital Single Lens Reflex (DSLR) cameras, and certainly an invitation to spend much, much more on accessories and other items that are needed just to get started.  Just to get started with this camera, I wound up ordering a Sony PRO-HG Duo HX 16 GB Memory Stick, and later ordered a Sony Media Memory Stick PRO-HG Duo and SDHC/SDXC USB Reader/Writer (MRWF3) to use with that just to make it easy to read the memory stick on any computer I wished.  (While my Sony Vaio laptop reads the Sony Memory Stick PRO cards natively, the other PC's in my home don't, so once I gifted my beloved Sony DSC-HX1 (Sony Cybershot DSC-HX1 9.1MP 20x Optical Zoom Digital Camera with Super Steady Shot Image Stabilization and 3.0 Inch LCD) camera over to my daughter and gave her the card reader that I had with the same card that had been used with it, I was left needing another reader...)I should note that I really didn't have to buy the Memory Stick PRO Duo card to go with this Alpha A37 as Sony opted to build in support for both SDHC and Memory Stick Pro Duo format.  That seems to be a concession to those among us that decry Sony's \"proprietary\" formats.  Of course Sony's documentation that comes with the camera and/or the marketing materials on the package for the camera seem to strongly suggest/recommend that the Memory Stick Pro Duo card be selected over the SDHC format \"for better performance\" with shooting video and the like.  Whether that is an absolute necessity is something that I think each user would determine, with the likely answer being \"No\" for most users.Beyond the memory stick, there was also the necessity (for me at least) of obtaining a case or camera bag for this piece of expensive electronics.  While I could have obtained a less expensive and more generic, and likely just as useful and protective, camera bag, I opted to go with a Sony LCS-AMA/B Digital SLR Carrying Case for Sony Alpha Digital SLR Camera (Sony LCS-AMA/B Digital SLR Carrying Case for Sony Alpha Digital SLR Camera), at least initially.  I'll wind up doing a separate review of that item (which I generally like), but will mention a few things here as this seems a good place to discuss accessories for this particular camera.  That bag is nice, but I found myself a bit frustrated with it in that there is not much extra space in that bag.  Once the A37 is inserted in the bag, there's no room for any additional lenses, and the side pockets on that case/bag have very little room within them as well (barely room to store the USB cable that comes with the camera, along with the USB card reader mentioned above).  Sadly there's absolutely no room to store the documentation for the camera there, so if I want to refer back to those materials later, I'm stuck bringing up a copy (if I can find it) of a .pdf on my smart phone or other similar device.  While that works, I kind of like the idea of having the documentation available, especially I am admittedly a total novice at the use of DSLRs.As I circle back to that (my status as a DSLR newbie), I'll clarify a bit and say that I have plenty of experience with nicer point-and-shoot cameras, especially high zoom beasts like the Sony DSC-HX1, or the Nikon Coolpix P100 (Nikon Coolpix P100 10 MP Digital Camera with 26x Optical Vibration Reduction (VR) Zoom and 3-Inch LCD (Black)) that Amazon so nicely sold me a few years back.  Add in a Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX30V (Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX30V 18.2 MP Exmor R CMOS Digital Camera with 20x Optical Zoom and 3.0-inch LCD (Black) (2012 Model)) and the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH20K (Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH20K 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 8x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Black)) that I had purchased for my then fiance (now wife), and you'd find I can work my way around a nice camera, but again, SLRs, and especially DSLRs are different beasts.Prior to working with those previously mentioned point-and-shoot cameras, the last \"good\" camera (besides a Polaroid Spectra Instant camera) I had was an old 35MM SLR that my father had obtained for me at one of the many yard sales he had gone to.  That camera came into my hands back in 1990's, and was in need of serious cleaning at the point I got it.  It was taken to a camera repair shop and was \"rebuilt\" as best it could be, but it had already suffered some of the effects of its age and neglect, or perhaps the extra lens that I had purchased for it had, but either way, I was left intriqued by the idea of a nice SLR but unwilling to invest the kind of money into my photography habit that owning an SLR would have necessitated at that time.  Here I am, some years later, and I'm finally getting into the hobby a bit more and am really looking forward to using this Sony A37 much, much more in the future, as I definitely will be adding some additional lenses (my Amazon Wishlist is already well stocked with a couple of lenses that I'd like to add soon) to my collection.The 18-55mm lens that this camera comes with is a decent lens, at least for starters, and my initial experience with it fits very nicely with a discussion about DSLRs that has been taking place at one of my favorite internet hang-outs.  There-in, or somewhere mentioned there-in, was a note about how we've progressed fairly well past the times when the \"starter\" lens that was included with DSLRs were quickly cast aside because they weren't that useful.  Apparently, at least according to the well schooled person making the argument, the camera manufacturers have realized they need to package a reasonably useful lens with their entry level offerings.  I think that's a very valid point to make, and am glad to benefit from that thought myself.  Given the cost of some of these lenses (for example, the Sony SAL18250 Alpha DT 18-250mm f/3.5-6.3 High Magnification Zoom Lens w/Lens Hood (Sony SAL18250 Alpha DT 18-250mm f/3.5-6.3 High Magnification Zoom Lens w/Lens Hood); the Sony DT 18-70mm f/3.5-5.6 Aspherical ED Standard Zoom Lens for Sony Alpha Digital SLR Camera (Sony DT 18-200mm f/3.5-6.3 Aspherical ED High Magnification Zoom Lens for Sony Alpha Digital SLR Camera); or the current object of my desires the Sony 75-300mm f/4.5-5.6 Compact Super Telephoto Zoom Lens for Sony Alpha Digital SLR Camera (Sony 75-300mm f/4.5-5.6 Compact Super Telephoto Zoom Lens for Sony Alpha Digital SLR Camera)), it could get expensive rather quickly to be buying a new lens just because you are not thrilled with the lens that the camera came with.Besides the lenses, there are also accessories like flash attachements and the like that should be considered and can add to the expenses (some of those items are also populating my Wish List currently ;-) )  Oh, I shouldn't forget nice books like David Busch's Sony Alpha SLT-A55/A33 Guide to Digital Photography (David Busch's Sony Alpha SLT-A55/A33 Guide to Digital Photography), which I hope to see updated for the A37 model as that author's books seem to be very highly regarded.In terms of use of this camera, I had some initial trepidation in getting started with this camera just because it feels like there are so many options, modes, and possible variables that are involved in using this camera to get a good photo.  Once I got past some of my initial confusion of the controls of this camera when compared to the Sony and Nikon point-and-shoot high-zoom cameras that I'd been more used to (for example, where the \"on-off\" switch is on this camera, the point-and-shoot models offer the wide/tall zoom control), I found the use of this very nice camera to be fairly much second nature.  Gently rotate the lens to zoom out/in, and then depending on the settings let the camera do most of the work for me automatically, or rotate the control knob to select another mode that offers the user the kind of control they might be looking for with this type of camera.I've uploaded a sample image that is shown with the maximum zoom when using the 18-55mm lens, as well as the same basic photo without the zoom, just so readers here can compare the image results.  My own opinion is that the image quality in the photos I've been able to take with this camera are very, very nice.  While I'd like to do more side-by-side comparisons of this camera with either of the aforementioned point-and-shoot cameras, until I pick up a few more lenses, I don't think it would be a fair comparison given the zoom range offered by my other available options.  Additionally, I've uploaded some images that show the camera in the aforementioned case, as well as showing the camera with the LCD display on the back shown in various orientations.The Manufacturer's Product description covers all of the technical details of this fine piece of electronics and includes all of the keywords that might be looked for when researching DSLRs.  I don't want to waste the reader's time here with a repeat of those specifications and features.  I would point out one potential missing function that Sony had included in the DSC-HX30v that I had recently reviewed and that is the GPS and Compass feature that helps keep track of where images were captured at.  Honestly, I can't speak to other DSLRs that might include that functionality or how much more expensive it might make a camera, I would just offer the point that it has been a more useful feature to see added to cameras.One final thought here, and that's of the feeling that there will be, sadly for me, times when I won't be able to make use of this nice camera where I wish I could.  Sadly many of the concerts that I like to attend and shoot pictures at disallow the use of \"professional\" style cameras -- a label they loosely define as any camera that offers lenses that can be replaced, e.g., SLR or DSLR type cameras.  That frustrates and saddens me as I'd love to be able to use this camera as an all the time, any where and every where, camera, but instead it seems to be more destined for me to use more for portraits, or perhaps in outings to the zoo or museums (where photography is allowed).Note that I did later purchase one of these (Sony ACC-AMFM11 Accessory Kit (Includes NP-FM500H Rechargeable Battery Pack and LCS-SC11 Case) for the Sony Alpha Digital SLR) bags to use with this camera, rather than the aforementioned case.  I like this case a little better for my uses since it offers the room to carry along an alternate lens and also offers more room for carrying around the battery charger and keeping everything all together.==Updated to add: looking back over the photos my wife and I took with this camera on a trip we took over the past weekend, I'd have to say I was impressed with the Auto Portrait Framing feature.  (See the specifications above for more details)  I took a few photos of my wife and her daughter and someone graciously volunteered to take a picture of all 3 of us as well.  The camera's Auto Portrait Framing feature engaged and with each of the photos we had taken, the camera automatically added an extra photo that framed the primary subjects of those photos.  On a couple of the photos that meant that I was clipped off (cropped) on the side a bit, but still, you could easily see how the camera was applying the logic of figuring out what the subject was and automatically generating a portrait of them to go along with the original shoot.  Very neat.Also updated to add: I see someone else noticed one of the issues that I came to notice, the autofocus feature during video recordings which creates (motor) noise that is picked up by the microphone.  That can be rectified by adding on an external microphone, but that becomes yet another accessory that would have to be added to the list of things to purchase with this camera.  Admittedly, if someone is spending the kind of money that a good DSLR costs, they may not notice that additional cost that much, but it would tend to push me much more in the direction of looking for a nice bundle that included not only the camera and starter lens, but an additional battery, the external microphone, an alternate lens, etc."],["Sorry this is not a scientific report like most of the great reviews on here.....Bought this camera for its sweep panorama abilities and low light hand held abilities.. Having a Sony DSC-HX9V and a Sony DSC-HX7V .....many of the same advanced features that are on these point & shoots are on the A37.......especially in camera HDR...  Plus just I wanted to see what gives with Sony DSLR's these days.....I went to Sedona for two weeks in December...sun and then some snow...lots and lots of beautiful long lasting sunsets. I felt like this little A37 DSLR gave me a great new amount of versatility due to many of its point & shoot special features except it would be put down on a large sensor this time instead of the small sensors that are on all point & shoots...Though I brought with me a few Nikon D2Xs's (and other NIKON DSLR's), a Canon 40D with the f1.2 50mm lens,  I ended up using this Sony nearly all the time.Manually cleaning the sensor on this camera is the simplest of any DSLR I have ever had.I used a Polaroid filter quite a bit but you have to be careful when doing a panorama sweep with one attached since it will give you an uneven blue sky.Fuji and Canon have quite a few bridge cameras out right now but I would argue this camera is light and priced in the bridge camera range re the Fuji HS50EXR.I would buy this Sony A37 instead of the Fuji or Canon bridge cameras and with the 18-55mm kit lens....the 18mm to 150mm (I think that is the mm of the next kit camera lens on this model) is a lot more money but probably more versatile...EBAY has a bus load of Minolta lenses and so does KEH.com...I guess you have to be careful about the Minolta lenses a bit to make sure you don't get one that grinds?  Not sure but I think there might be some issues with some Minolta AF lenses being used on some of the Sony bodies...I would have to google that information but this might be a precautionary note.  Also they are selling lenses for the SONY NEX  and calling them ALPHA lenses as well but of course those don't fit the SONY DSLR line...so be careful about that as well...I was thinking about buying cine lens made by Rokinon/Samyang lens and getting an external mic for doing video.  Anybody do this yet?The fact is that bridge cameras still use a small sensor compared to a true DSLR like this Sony so that is another reason to consider this camera before you buy a bridge camera.The only MAJOR gripe I would have with the Sony A37 is that the flip out LCD does not articulate to the side at all and you wonder WHY a company would go through the trouble of putting a partially articulating LCD on a camera after all these years!!  Just do it right the first time!!!! I guess it is better to have the A37's partially articulating LCD than none....I guess the problem is when you have full articulation it takes away some space on the left back hand side of the camera for some buttons for quick accessing certain features...The other issue I have with this A37 camera (not a gripe since it might just be \"me\"} is dealing with a circle or spot when the camera is pointed towards the sun...you can expect some flare but more like a spear of light rather than a circle.  I was able to mitigate this by angling the camera but it was unusual to get a perfect circle in the camera center rather than an angled spike of light....don't know if this has something to do with my technique, the kit lens, or the new translucent light transmission used in this camera and/or a combination of all three?  I might be the only one to have had this center circle spot flare?  I had never seen this type of sun glare resulting in a centered circle in any camera I have ever used. Has anybody else experienced this type of circle or spot caused by sun glare on this camera?  I contacted Sony about this flare spot issue and they had me send some samples which I did but they never got back to me so I just gave up.The battery life on this camera is excellent. You can buy cheap 3rd party batteries and chargers either here on Amazon or on EBAY....In short, this camera feels like a Fuji, Panasonic, or Canon bridge camera but it is a true DSLR.  Plus this Sony A37 has all kinds of cool features you would find in the Sony point & shoot line.Though some people on here say this is a good beginner DSLR model, that is nonsense.  This is a fun camera to augment my much heavier and more complex Nikons DSLR's.The whole thing is the image you have in your mind to catch......and if you have a camera that is fun to use and can do things your much more expensive cameras might not be able to do, then why not sling one of these along as well?You are not out a lot of cash...you might not EVER buy another Sony DSLR (in my case I just have mostly Nikon lenses and only have the Canon DSLR due to the fact Nikon does not make an F1.2 50mm auto focus lens). I can still use T-mount lenses on this Sony A37.The U.S. Air Force used to have small jet trainer named the T37 that was even used as an attack aircraft not just a trainer and it was called the A37!!  This little Sony A37 is a big surprise and no wonder this site gave its highest rating.Again...you might be a Nikon or Canon only person and don't want to start down some new mount (actually old mount) path. I considered that as well as I pondered this camera and then thought..what the heck...why not? It had all the fun features on those two Sony point & shoots that I love.This A37 camera will go with me everywhere from now on since it gives me a whole new array of tools that I would not have without some effort on my tried and true giant B52 battleship sized Nikons.This A37 can do fast moving sports/action photos as well....though I prefer to use my Nikon D2HS's, D1H's, and D1's for that kind of action.  BUT that being said, this SONY A37 does great with my granddaughter's softball league games...both the day and night games..The images I took in Sedona and around Flagstaff and Winslow and Tuba City came out great with the A37 ....I used it in conjunction with my Nikons so this is not an either/or proposition.  The A37 is just another tool in the holster you can pull out when you don't want to go to the tripod.....in camera HDR...in camera automatically stitched panoramas...hand held low light ease of use.Give it chance if you think your photography needs these tricks available to you at times...This Sony A37 will bail you out..It is fun to use as well.If you are in the photojournalist school of taking images....this camera will play right into that non formal style of shooting...it's like a point & shoot (re all the cool Sony features) except it has a nice usable viewfinder and big sensor..  Lots of NIKON and CANON people secretly would LOVE to give these Sony DSLR's a chance so here is your chance without draining the checking account...Have some fun and buy an A37!!!  Sony has scrambled and scrambled to create some nifty DSLR's and you can look at this A37 as sort of a Whitman's Sampler chocolate box...They have done some really nice things here ...I decided to give them a chance on their DSLR line up and don't regret a second of it...."],["Camera has all I want as a amateur trying to take better photo's and occansionally capture a digital movie. The view finder and back display are graining but then again this didn't cost anywhere near the price of a pro comera would"],["I was unable to find this model locally, often finding it's siblings (A65 and A57), so I took a chance and ordered this based off what I saw from these two other models.  I am satisfied with this camera so far, however I've only had it about a week so I have not had a chance to put it through it's paces.  I was concerned about the grip, but this has not been a big issue for me even with my large hands.  I do prefer to the grip of the A57 and A65 more, however I appreciate the smaller size of this model.  I previously used micro four thirds equipment, so I am used to smaller equipment, this is not much bigger then my old Panasonic G1, however the lens mount sits farther out from the camera making the overall package bulkier.  I like that the sensor used in this camera is the same one used in other more advanced models, I am a skilled photographer and I do not use many of the automated modes, scenes, etc.  I'm not opposed to these, but I find that they often change settings that I can change myself since I am knowledgeable in how these affect the end result.  I primarily shoot using Aperture or Shutter priority, or manual mode.  I would like to have seen a couple custom modes to set up some different white balance settings, color modes, etc. But these are fairly easy to set up on the fly.  There is a dedicated depth of field button on the front of the camera next to the lens which is a welcome feature for an entry level camera.  There is also a button with a question mark on it on the back, when pushed it offers tips on taking pictures, I wish this was user definable, I don't need a how-to manual, but I would like a button to access the quality settings.  The screen on the back of the camera is ok as far as the resolution for composing the shot, but the viewing angles are horrible, anything other then straight on viewing makes it difficult to see, not usually an issue for me as I use the viewfinder predominantly, but it would have been nice to have a little better screen.  I am still undecided on this camera, I like the potential of this camera, however it has a lot of gimmicks that I will not find useful (panoramic, 3D, scenes, etc.) and admittedly I am not the target consumer for this camera, it is geared towards a new photographer that does not know much about the basics but still wants to take nice looking pictures, which I'm sure it can handle.  I find that investing in camera bodies is a waste of money, and from that stand point this offers the same image quality that one can get from Sony's higher end models at a significant savings.  I do not like the kit lens (18-55mm), it is mediocre in it's clarity and is too dark to be all that useful to me, I would have loved to be able to buy this camera bundled with the Sony 35mm F1.8 lens as this will be the lens I purchase to use primarily on this camera.  This camera offers a lot of bang for the buck, in addition to some cheap gimmicks it also throws in some features which will be useful to advanced photographers looking to upgrade on the cheap.To recap:Pros:High image quality for the moneyCompactComfortable grip and well laid out buttons (I don't smash buttons accidentally when shooting)A dedicated depth of field buttonSupport for Minolta lenses manufactured from the mid 1980's onPlug for an external micPlug for a remote shutter releaseSupport for two different kinds of memory (SD card and Sony memory stick)Cons:No decent lens offered with the kitLots of gimmick featuresQuestion mark button cannot be reprogrammedNo extra grip offered (a battery grip would be nice to have the option of adding)Viewing angles for rear screen are poorProprietary hot shoe (Not a big deal to me, but worth noting)UPDATE 2/18/2013I've shot with this camera much more and I can say I'm happier with it now then when I originally wrote my review.  The thing that stands out to me is that even at higher ISO's, the images are still quite usable.  I previously used a handful of micro 4/3 cameras, and while I loved the size and especially the Panasonic 20mm lens, I found the images good but lacking.  This is not the case with this camera, I feel like the images are pro quality, even if the camera is not.  I have become used to the controls and don't find myself as encumbered by them, I still wish I could do something else with the question mark button and custom settings modes would be great to allow for switching to a set of commonly used parameters quickly, but overall I am happy with my purchase.  Another thing to note is that I have added a couple older Minolta lenses to my kit and these work quite well.  They use the older \"screw drive\" focus mechanism, but this does not seem to make them any slower or otherwise hinder their use, and surprisingly they are no noisier then the kit lens with it's built in motor.  I am still impressed that this camera has the built in motor for these older screw focus lenses, this is something other manufacturers dropped in their cameras and therefore reduced the compatibility.  As far as I'm aware, any Minolta lens with mount onto this thing and work without any major compromises, which is great because there is a lot of good old glass out there that can be had at a bargain price!"],["this camera is amazing, it takes great pictures, and i love the effects that u can take when shooting as JEG, the raw format availability makes this camera a good choice."],["So, I decided to purchase the a37 because of its wonderful dimunitive size.  I mean its advertised that it has the same sensor, advertised that the Bionz engine is the same as the a77 and the only thing it seems to fault on is the lower rear screen and speed buffers and speed of fast shooting.  I am here to tell you with the same Sony 35mm f1.8 Alpha lens, it is NOT EQUAL in speed of focus and function based on my night time shooting.  Look, I am a HUGE Sony fanboy and I was willing to sacrifice the rear screen as well for the size.  BUT, once you've gotten use to 950K screen resolution and you go down to 230K, FORGET ABOUT IT.  So dim and viewing angles are SO POOR, you wonder WHY Sony even put the tilt screen on it.  YOU CANT see it in the other angles!  Then there is the viewfinder which the reviews and specs say its the exact same one as the a57, advertising the TrueView, something, well I had read on Cnet that she thought the view finder looked dim and SURE ENOUGH...IT IS NOT Bright as the a57!  This is huge for me to get over. Also, NO horizontal or verticle axis balance meter and that is another HUGE deal.  If you've gotten use to it in the a57 it takes the guess work out of if your pictures are balanced and most of mine I had to adjust afterwards but you never can really be sure IMO.  Ok, so back to the focusing.  IT WAS NOT GOOD compared to the a57.  Daytime, NO problem, my daytime pics looked GREAT as usual but I am into nighttime photography and IMO, it did not focus OVER HALF the time.  It would hunt and just be all off!  I HATE that I have to write this but IF you decided you dig the SLT Sony's PLEASE, upgrade to the a57 and you will be set!  It's got to be something they did in memory or something to cheapen the product.  If you read all the reviews from the a57, they all say ITS QUICK as hell, SNAPPY, FAST to focus.  I think sure they say its the same Bionz engine but if the fast frame shooting is lower by many frames and supposedly everything is the same, WHY is it slower?  Could it be to save the battery, voltage has been reduced and that's why focusing was way down?  Could that be the reason why the viewfinder is noticeably dimmer? Build wise, its SOLID, but again, that rear LCD screen can not be dismissed.  ITS AWFUL!  and you know how on the a57, you can even flip the screen completely around so that the back of the screen is solid black plastic, well you can't do that on the a37.  Yes I also know the argument that you don't need to be looking at the screen to compose or check for pics but I am telling you, it sure IS NICE to have and the cheapness when I compare it to my a57 is IMO, I can't live with.  Again, if it were just that I would be ok, but I don't know in seconds or official conditions as to why I sense it is slower but IT IS SLOWER ANd I CANNOT see any reason for you to chose this over the a57!  It's not worth the $100 savings.  Performance and speed is essential to me.  Now, I guess, if your just going to sit around taking pics of wall flowers...I guess this works and FYI, the a57 is not that bad in size and weight.  It's just I was an idiot and am searching for the holy grail of SIZE but ease of lens.  I LOVE SONY but this product shot too low and is a disservice to the lineup."],["This Camera! This Camera!

The lens case looks luxurious and feels supple and soft, with an elastic drawstring, and decent padding along its sides and base. And, the lens hood is constructed well and screws on securely.Then comes the lens itself, which feels as solid as a tank (and weighs about half as much).

I mapped mine to Depth Of Field preview - moving this function to a much more natural access location.Alternatives considered:##################While deciding on this lens, I toyed with the idea of buying theSony Zeiss SAL1635Zinstead.However, I ultimately decided on the SAL2470Z for the following reasons:1) it is the closest to what might be considered a walkabout lens in the Zeiss stable.2) at the telephoto end, it can be paired with the highly rated SAL70200G, without any overlap, or gaps, in focal lengths.3) at the wide end, it can be paired with the excellentRokinon FE14M-S 14/2.8.I even considered theSony SAL2875(a rebadgedTamron A09M). I shortlisted this lens because of its lower weight (by about a pound) which puts it squarely in comfortable walkabout territory, and because of the much cited kurt munger review on its image quality.I chose to discount the Tamron early in the process as it is not compatible with the A99's AF-D - a must-have feature, in my opinion.In the end, I chose the SAL2470Z because of:1) its superior build quality - I expect this lens to outlast many bodies.2) its Super Sonic Wave Motor (SSM) focus mechanism - which is scary silent, making it great for video.3) its better optical quality as evidenced by other reviewers and bloggers.4) its speed - many reviewers considered the SAL2875 to be more of an f4 than an f2.8.I also discounted the weight because good, fast glass is heavy.So far, I could not be happier with my decision.Conclusion:########IMHO this is definitely the lens to get for the A99.When combined with the superb SAL50F14, and with the mind blowing ISO range of the A99, the SAL2470Z's constant f2.8 makes low-light captures (almost!) easy.I worried about the weight of this lens - and in many ways my fears were justified.No two ways about it, this is a heavy lens, and I can feel it after about half a day's worth of shooting.

I could tell it would get annoying over a day's shooting especially out and about and around such as when sightseeing and traveling.The Tamron is lighter and the pictures are almost as good.  Secondly the Zeiss did not feel as high quality as I expected.  The weight insinuates high quality but it wasn't super tight.  There was a little play in it.  I have Nikkor lenses and have had Minolta lenses.  Both feel much more precise and smooth in operation.  My Nikkor and Minolotas are 5 years and more older - maybe quality's gone down on them too lately.  I noticed the Sony A57 body is nowhere near high-quality in feel as My Nikon, Canons, and Minolta cameras but that's another review.  The Zeiss while good to very good quality did not have as high a quality feel to it.I returned this lens.  I don't begrudge someone who wants to get the very best photos and carry it around.  For me the tradeoff of weight and less than top-shelf quality didn't outweigh the Tamron's."],["I purchased this along with a Sony A99 body when I decided to switch from Canon to Sony. I haven't looked back since (see my review on theSony Alpha SLT-A99V Full-Frame 24.3 MP SLR Digital Camera with 3-Inch LED - Body Only (Black)). One of the major draws for me to switch to the Sony system was the ability to have access to the Zeiss glass with autofocus capabilities.  Add to that the fact that there is in-camera-body image stabilization, and I now have a laser sharp, image stabilized 24-70 f/2.8 (something that Canon does not currently offer).  After significant debate, and finally pulling the trigger, I switched to Sony with the idea that I would be able to work my way up to getting the Zeiss lens.  However, after trying this in the local camera shop, I couldn't resist the temptation and decided to make this my first/primary Sony lens. I don't regret the decision in the slightest.Please note that much of my review uses the Canon 24-70 f/2.8 L (Mark I) for comparison.  All observations are based on my experiences with that lens, and were limited to my own copy. Your copy may perform differently than mine did.Sharpness/Focus/Bokeh:One of my biggest frustrations when shooting with my Canon 24-70mm f/2.8L on a 7D was the inconsistences with focusing (lots of front AND back focusing issues), and the softness that I would get when shooting wide open.  Considering that this was one of Canon's flagship lenses and crop sensor cameras, I was very disappointed, to say the least. With the Zeiss 24-70 f/2.8, I don't have any of these issues.  Coupled with the A99s fantastic autofocus, this lens nails the shot nearly every time.  Additionally, when focusing manually, you can just \"grab and go\" and dial in your focus as needed, if needed.  What's more, the items in focus (both auto and manual) are extremely, overwhelmingly sharp.  I literally never knew a zoom could have such sharpness.  It truly does produce that \"3D\" effect that I've always read about with some great lenses ( i.e. Leica anything, Canon 85mm L, etc) that I thought was only attainable with prime lenses.  What's more, the sharpness is consistent at the different focal lengths and various apertures.  Certainly, the image stabilization helps in this regard, but it only serves to accentuate how sharp this lens actually is. Obviously, the depth of field at 2.8 is extremely narrow, so it is important to take care to monitor how this affects your shot if you're shooting wide open (focus zoom on the A99 can help here).  The bokeh is very beautiful, albeit different than what I've seen on other lenses.  I believe this has to do with the number of blades, however I'm not positive.  I shot a maternity shoot this past weekend, and I was definitely able to achieve a beautiful, dreamy quality when desired.  I've always been a sucker for narrow depth of field shots, so bokeh is definitely important to me.Contrast/Color:Like the sharpness and focus, this lens exceeds expectations in the contrast and color department.  For contrast, a properly exposed scene shows a great contrast in your mid tones, helping to heighten all of the subtle details in a scene.  In the realm of color, this may be the area where I'm most impressed.  I shoot in RAW, and the images straight out of camera have some of the most vibrant and beautiful colors I could have ever hoped for.  The reds are particularly beautifully rendered (all of this is assuming proper white balance, of course).  I often found with my Canon 24-70 that the contrast and color were lacking definition, clarity and vibrance, which led to more time spent fixing things in post (and less time shooting).  Coming from that, it's been an immense pleasure coming to this lens, and I actually find myself picking up my camera that much more often.Distortion/Chromatic Aberration/Vignetting:This lens does, like most zooms, show some minor distortion and slight vignetting at its widest focal length when used on a full sensor camera.  I personally like the look that wide angle distortion can allow if I'm shooting a close subject (vs a distant landscape); however, in the event that I'm shooting a distant landscape, everything is easily corrected in post.  One note on this, however, is that there is currently no lens profile directly through Adobe for this lens with the A99.  There is a website out there that offers a profile, which works reasonably well, and only requires minor tweaking.  As for shooting at the more normal/telephoto focal lengths, this lens is spot on with corner to corner luminance, and a complete lack of any focal length/barrel distortion. As for Chromatic Aberration, it's practically non-existent.  The Canon 24-70 has a reputation for poor CA performance, and I found that to be the case.  Again, very nice to move to a tool that performs flawlessly in this regard.Build Quality/Operation/Other:As mentioned in several other reviews, this thing is built like a tank. The amount of glass, coupled with the construction, feels professional, rugged, and it showcases the engineering that Zeiss is known for.  In my opinion, it balances very well on the A99, and feels very good in my hands (admittedly, I have very large hands, and I could see how this would be on the large side for a smaller person).  However, all of that glass comes with a price: the lens is heavy, without a doubt.  As I mentioned, I'm 6'4\", with large hands and arms, so holding this lens isn't too much of a chore for me, but I could see how it would be cumbersomely heavy for a smaller shooter. Comparing this to the Canon 24-70, it seems to be around the same weight, however it seems more compact, therefore feeling more dense, comparatively.  As for the operation, the zoom is smooth, yet sturdy, and the focus ring is precise and easy to use.  The focus selector switch isn't the easiest to operate without removing my eye from the camera, as it's placed further up on the lens than where I would intuitively reach for it.  Additionally, the lens hood is very well built and small in profile.  This was always something that I didn't like about the Canon: the imposing lens hood made me very self conscious when shooting street photography.  That being said, I do notice greater instances of flare with this hood, though they are rare.Price/Value:This lens is expensive.  Actually, let me rephrase that: this lens is VERY expensive.  But I'm sure you probably already knew that before reading this review.  So the question becomes: does it present a good value?  Am I getting something that is actually worth all of that money?  Do my children REALLY need to go to college?  My answer to all three of those questions is a resounding yes (though I'll let you figure out the last one).  Of course, the reality is that it actually depends on a variety of factors.  Since the definition of value is \"what we get for the cost,\" you really need to assess your own needs before you determine if you are getting something that is worth the price. For me, I look at this lens as an investment in my business.  While I view the slightly better quality vs another lens as something that will help me stand out from my competition, others may not see the quality differences as enough to justify the additional cost.  Every situation is different.For me, in the end, the stellar optics and build quality are second to none, and I honestly feel that the lens is worth its weight in gold (which, since we've already established that the lens is heavy, it is clearly worth a LOT of gold)."],["The bottom line is if you do photography as a hobby then maybe a tamrom 17-50 will be better for you or a 28-70. The difference in image quality is not that different depending on the situation. I find the image quality of the cz to be about 25% to 30% better but what your really paying for is the rugged mostly metal body and ssm motor. I have already had to return my tamron 3 times with issues that had nothing to do with image quality. This cz lens has cause me to get a cz 135 and now I am saving up for the 85mm and may even get the 50mm. When I do a event my pictures come out almost perfect so there is very little to do when converting to jpeg in lightroom 4. Time is money so it will pay for it self so its worth the price. I here sigma is good but I have never owned one so I cant comment on it. The one thing I dont like abot the lens is the rubber grip that collects dust and rubs on my jeans when hanging from the strap. I also don't like that its a external and not internal zoom."],["A truly &#34;excellent&#34; lens at all focal lengths.  It is my go-to lens for just about every occasion.  That excellence does, however, come with the a price:  weight."],["Great lens.  My pictures come out fantastic.  However, there are two things you need to consider.  One is a zeiss prime can be better in some situations (i.e. sal24f20 or sal135f18).  Two is the camera you are using (not good with the SLTs).  I do not believe any of the non-full frame cameras from sony can handle low light ACTION situations (poor noise reduction at high iso).  Even the A77 performs poorly.  This may change when the rumored A99 FF comes out later this year.  Though the A77 has autofocus micro adjustments, others like the A55 does not.  The autofocus may be a little behind or in front of your subject without the micro adjustment feature.  At times I feel this lens cannot be fully utilized in certain situations until Sony comes out with the next fullframe camera (so the lens is too much for the body to handle).  I have not tried with the A850 or A900."],["Perfect, very sharp lens with beauty bokeh. With my Sony A900 it is best duet I have ever seen. Fast focusing, very good work in every situations."],["I've been pinching pennies until they screamed  to get this lens and it just arrived.First impression: This is a massive piece of metal and glass. The illustration do not do it justice. It tips the scales at two pounds and it totally changes the balance of the camera. Long, fat and heavy, I had to shift my grip on the A77.The zoom is smooth and firm, no creep. Focus is sharp and reasonably fast. I have only shot about 60 frames so far, mostly landscapes with a polarizing warming filter.Shots so far have been clear, clean and crisp. I'm really enjoying having a slightly wider bottom than the Tamron 28-70. 4mm makes a huge difference in a crop sensor sometimes."],["One of the best things buying a Sony DSLRs is the option of buying a Carl Zeiss lens.  I bought a Sony A77 recently (luckily I found one) and without any hesitation bought a 24-70mm f/2.8 ZA lens.  I use this to shoot models.  This is a true classic Zeiss lens in that it's very well-made (in today's standards) and it is heavy at 1kg or about 2.2 lbs. (the way it's supposed to be for a fast f/2.8 lens).  This feels like a Zeiss 120mm Makro-Planar lens for Hasselblad which I like a lot.  This lens takes breathtaking pictures; no, \"photographs.\"  Personally, I think the price is a bargain at $1,650.  The zoom ring is nice and tight, the SSM is incredible with almost no detectable sound when it focuses, you have to use it to appreciate it.  On my A77, this lens focuses automatically without you having to depress the shutter half way down.  Just point the camera at various objects and distances and you'll put this lens to work and will see how amazingly sweet this lens is.  If you don't have the budget, wait until you have the budget.  This lens is worth the extra money.  Take care of it and you can use it for life.  It's almost sacred to me.  I love it."],["I love this lens! It hasn't come off my camera since I got it. It's sharp as a tack, the focal range is right about what you'd need 98% of the time, and it's sharp enough that you can still use it all the way down to 2.8. My only gripe is the weight, but that's a small price to pay for the quality of this thing."],["I will say that this is the ONE lens you'll need especially if you're a portrait photographer.  If you're on this page, surely you already know the legacy of Carl Zeiss lenses as far as construction and of course quality.  Fortunately for Sony Alpha users, these Carl Zeiss lenses are the answer to Canon's L series and Nikon's G/Nikkor lenses. I'm personally using this with the Alpha 700 so I don't get that true 24mm but I do get a longer reach beyond 70mm because of the crop factor.  Despite that, this is on my camera 90% of the time [when wider angle needed, I'll go with my previous favorite, Tamron's 17-50mm 2.8 lens].The construction quality like I mentioned is second to none.  This lens definitely has a good weight to it so beware if you're shooting for longer periods of time.  The vertical grip is a match though to help balance this lens for a long day's shoot.  The body and even lens hood is made of metal so it's definitely durable.  One gripe is the ribbed focusing and zoom rings which can catch dirt/dust time to time.The image quality produced from this lens is wonderful as expected.  For me, had no problem in sharpness edge to edge and with an aperture of 2.8, it does fairly well in low light matched with a high ISO.  It does have pin cushion syndrome in wide angle but otherwise not too much of a bother.  Focusing is fast and quiet and accurate [I personally set my a700 to focus only in the center point so I can predict the focusing 99% of the time].I don't know what else to say other than yes the price tag is BIG but as many said: Invest in glass than the camera body.  Camera bodies will be out in 12-18 months from the time you purchase your DSLR so don't rely on getting the latest bodies unless you have cash.  Lenses though are different and are refreshed not so often.  When the best comes, it's the best for a long time to come and this lens will be here for quite awhile.For my work, please visit:[...]blog:[...]Thanks!JJ"],["I bought this lens as an upgrade from the SAL-1680Z, which I gave to my wife.  Compared to the 16-80, this lens is slightly sharper, with slightly better color, slightly better flare control,  no vignetting, and no distortion (although it's not as wide as the other Zeiss' 16mm).  The SSM focus is faster and quieter, and the build quality is better overall.  How do I know this?  Because sand got kicked into the 16-80 and it pretty much ruined it (Sony wanted $550 to repair it, our local guy is doing it for $170).  Meanwhile, the 24-70 just got back from a very sandy trip to the desert, as seen in my attached pictures, and still works great.  Sand was everywhere; on the lens, in the camera bag, in the air -- the camera and lens even took a tumble off the tripod and survived just fine.  That tells me the tolerances are tighter.As far as image quality goes, the difference between the two lenses is only marginal.  I do like the faster 2.8, which came in very handy in a no-flash situation at a dark concert.  Another significant advantage for the 24-70 is the rich bokeh, which rivals any prime lens. However, for landscapes and in bright settings, the cheaper lens will perform almost as well.The downsides to this lens are of course its very high cost, its weight (a sacrifice for quality) and its sheer size.  I don't look forward to hauling this baby on my next trek in the mountains. The 16-80 is a great travel lens because it's relatively lightweight and small, with a great range.  The 24-70 is less versatile, heavier and much larger.  Yes, you will get the best pictures possible on a Sony camera with this lens, and that's why I bought it, but for the money, the 16-80 is just as good, if not better (just buy the insurance)."],["Couple this witha Sony a900 and you will have a system you won't believe. I researched this lens for a long time. There are several indepth technical reviews on the net that can describe this lens better than I can. I can say that it produces extremely sharp images with great contrast. With it's large maximum aperature it makes focusing and composition a pleasure. It is a big lens but carrying around a few extra  ounces is well worth it. If you are serious about photography and can afford the price buy it."],["It is sharp, heavy, beautiful, and fulfills any needs of a photographer. Highly recommend it.

Zoom and manual focus seems very good.My 6,000x4,000 pixel still images are flawless and sharp with the FF sensor. AF is fast and smooth but quite noisy during video recordings; the AF motor is loud when using onboard mic or even my Sony shotgun mic mounted directly on camera. If clean audio is critical, I recommend manual focus to eliminate AF motor noise. The zoom ring is a bit stiff and doesn't always make for graceful smooth zooms; this may improve when I get used to it.The only drawback for me is that the Sony G-series 70-300 zoom lens may have been a more useful investment because of the additional zoom capacity at half the price. I doubt the image quality would much different, especially for video which only captures 2MP of the 24GB FF sensor.But I would highly recommend the lens if you have the money and 24-70 zoom is acceptable.  2.8 f-stop is nice.

This is totally false. Satisfying and great photos were taken with gear in the past that would be junk today. Great award winning photos are being taken with so so lenses and amateur cameras today. Digital imaging has also improved image quality as well.With that in mind, is it worth it to spend $1600 on a lens when there are many excellent alternatives made by Tamron, Sony, Sigma, as well as many used Minolta lenses for much less money? Some of those old Minolta lenses are quite good too.If you are not a pro making a living from your images (or a life long photo taking fanatic) save $1000-1400+ dollars and look at the broader range of lenses minus the little blue Zeiss logo."],["Well worth the money, this glass is amazing!

I also shoot for a studio in Chicago and whenever I pull this lens out with my A99, the other photographers are immediately demoralized and ALWAYS ask if they can try it.

Shooting with Sony sets me apart from the competition, but having this lens in my kit takes things to a whole nother level."],["This lens was a replacement for a Sigma 28-70 2.8 EX DG lens. That lens was a replacement for a Minolta variable aperture crappo lens I bought back in the 80s. The Sigma was fine, but the zoom ring rotated opposite to every other lens I've ever owned and it was never as sharp and the focus never as accurate as I had hoped for.I've owned this lens now for about four months and I have only one bad thing to say. For most of you, this will be meaningless, but for those shooters who use full-frame format cameras, you should know this lens will vignette at the corners with a filter attached.If you use a UV/Haze filter for \"protection,\" you may notice some small vignette at the corners at 24mm. I never have a filter attached unless it's a polarizer and since a UV filter is thinner than the rotating ring of a CPL filter, the UV ring may not intrude upon the image. If you stack a CPL onto the UV filter, I would say you will have a great deal of vignette at 24mm and maybe some around 30mm.Other than that, the lens is amazing. Super sharp all the way to the corners and the focus is very, very fast and accurate. I used this lens for a time on a Konica Minolta 7D (6 megapixels) and it was great, but when I finally upgraded to a Sony a900 I was treated to a feast of sharpness and clarity.Sure, it's big and it's heavy. And expensive. These are small penalties for what you get in return. If you want better image quality, you'd have to carry three or four prime lenses with a net weight gain in your camera bag.Oh, one other thing: The zoom ring rubber grip is very pretty, but the knurling is so fine that it's hard to feel exactly where you are grabbing the lens. I prefer the old Minolta grips with the deep grooves that were also angled relative to the lens barrel because they were so easy to feel with your fingertips."],["This is the best lens that Sony/Zeiss have offered thus far, even more versatile than theSony SAL-85F14Z 85mm f1.4 Carl Zeiss Planar T Coated Telephoto Lens for Sony Alpha Digital SLR CameraandSony SAL-135F18Z 135mm f/1.8 Carl Zeiss Sonnar T Telephoto Lens for Sony Alpha Digital SLR Camera, which are incredible lenses.  I have compared this Sony/Zeiss 24-70mm f/2.8 lens to the legendary Minolta 28-70mm f/2.8 G lens using the Imatest lens test software.  At an aperture of f2.8, the Minolta 28-70 lens at 28mm focal length and the Zeiss 24-70 lens at 24mm focal length are equally sharp in the center, but the Zeiss lens is sharper at the corners.  The Zeiss 24-70 lens does exhibit a minor amount of chromatic aberration but to no serious extent.  It also exhibits moderate barrel distortion at 24mm, as do its Canon and Nikon 24-70 counterparts.  The barrel distortion is more pronounced with a full frame sensor than with a half frame sensor.Sony and Zeiss have a very useful partnership going, which I hope will result in a greater variety of lenses in the future.  Recently, Sony and Zeiss have introduced aSony SAL1635Z 16-35mm f/2.8 ZA Lensthat improves upon the rare and coveted Minolta 17-35mm f3.5 G lens.Two minor complaints about this lens are the following.  First, like the other Sony/Zeiss lenses, it is rather heavy, but I suppose that good glass is heavy.  Second, it zooms by elongating externally unlike the Minolta 28-70mm f/2.8 G lens.  However, the Canon and Nikon 24-70 lenses elongate in a similar manner, so perhaps this feature is a compromise that one must accept in exchange for sharpness at f2.8.Reviews of the Sony/Zeiss 24-70 lens may be found at the Photozone and lemondedelaphoto web sites.  The latter site is French but web pages may be translated via Google."],["the lens will last several Sony camera bodies too!  its heavy though. Tack sharp...just look a 100% crop!! the focusing is super quick and silent, useful for videoing!"],["A gallon of milk weighs between 8.5 and 8.8 pounds depending on the percentage of fat. Compare that to 3 pounds, 13 ounces. That's the total weight of this lens on my Sony A57 camera, including the A57 strap, its battery, and a memory card. That's exactly 2 pounds heavier than the DSLR camera kit it replaced, an Olympus E-510--also with strap, battery, and memory card. So even though I really heard, processed, and took into consideration what people said about the weight of this Zeiss lens, I was still ever so slightly surprised to experience its feel in my hands. For about 5 minutes I even wondered if I'd made a mistake. Thankfully, I hadn't; this was a wise buy for my purposes.I'm not a professional photographer, but I'm a very experienced amateur. In light of that, I was called upon to act as the impromptu photographer at one wedding and the videographer at three weddings.I bought this lens to be the only lens for my Sony A57, reasoning that I could justify its expense because with a lens of this quality (1) my photos would be far nicer than with the kit lens; (2) I could take better advantage of the full HD video of which my camera is capable; (3) the total cost would be comparable to buying a DSLR with kit lens AND a decent digital video camera, while taking better video than that video camera would, and better photos than that camera would; and (4) it would hopefully outlast the camera and be used on new Sony cameras over the next couple of decades--or longer. That last point is still a hope, and impossible to verify until quite a lot of time passes, obviously, but the other points have borne themselves out.With this lens I often get stellar photos. The video is likewise excellent, although especially in quiet environments the camera's microphone does pick up the sound of the lens refocusing. I was marginally disappointed by this, thinking that the focusing would be whisper quiet. It is indeed nearly noiseless to the ear while in use--but the built in microphone is closer than one's ear. Naturally, a shotgun mic or a lapel mic setup could solve this problem; for me, though, it's just not a big enough problem to warrant going to the extra expense and bother of enacting either solution. And if what I've seen about the A57 on YouTube and elsewhere is accurate, the kit lens sounds louder--although I have not verified this in person.To end where I began, my camera with this lens is objectively a lot heavier than the camera kit it replaced--more than double the weight. But I'm a grown man, so carrying around something that weighs less than a half gallon of milk is not a ridiculous proposition. You know you're carrying it, but in my final analysis, the benefits outweigh (sorry for the pun; I couldn't help myself!) that one drawback.I've several times used it to--on a single day--take hundreds of photos and a half hour or more of video. Not once have I thought the camera was too bulky or heavy even after carrying it around for a number of hours--especially upon review of the photos and video I've captured. In fact, the lens weight eliminates a bit of hand shake, which is especially noticeable in the smoother handheld video footage. Maybe the weight isn't a net drawback after all."],["Lens preforms excellent, I purchased for my A580 and have been very happy with the results!I would definitely recommend For any serious photo enthusiasts.

Honestly, you half-shutter press and it's just THERE.  Initial inspection of test shots indicates its sharper too.  I will probably do a full focus test with a nice chart to see if I need to dial in my AF module...but that's as much to verify I haven't mucked with the camera too much as with the lens.Included hood has a nice soft velvety flocking texture on the inside surfaces of the lens hood.

On the A55 it's fat enough I can't even put the camera 'down' and get it to rest flat on the table, it projects below the bottom plane of the body.  Simple enough to fix...guess I sense a body upgrade in my future. :-)  If you are into underwater photography and have Ikelite housing, this lens is just barely too fat to fit the port body - the MF/AF/focus lock button sticks out too far for comfortable insertion, and I can't imagine rigging a zoom ring coupling of my own (even a rubber band belt would probably be too thick).The lens does extend with zooming but doesn't seem to with focusing, so it will 'bellows' air into it and as it isn't dust/moisture sealed will have to watch it in adverse conditions for particulate ingress."],["I've had this lens for three years now.  It will equal or out perform many good prime lenses.  As you'd expect, it will not outperform the Zeiss primes, based on my experience with the Zeiss 135 and 85, which are outside its focal length range anyway.  (I also have the Zeiss 24mm F2, but I haven't used it enough yet to say.)  If you have a full frame (FF) camera and can afford this lens, you simply must have it.  It is superb in color, resolution, CA, flare control, and bokeh.  I have 10 FF lenses, but this lens lives on my A99 camera and is always my walk-around choice.  In that role, the only downsides are size and weight, which come with the territory for f2.8 FF zooms.I sold my Hasselblad film equipment when I bought my first Sony DSLR.  I invested in some FF lenses because I thought I'd eventually go FF.  One of the primary reasons I went with Sony instead of Canon or Nikon was this lens.  I had used Carl Zeiss lenses with Hasselblad, and I knew they were the best (only challenged by the Leica M lenses, which were in a totally different category anyway).  People love to criticize Sony for not having a big enough lens lineup.  Just having this lens does an awful lot to take the teeth out of that argument.  (I'll admit I'd like a CZ 50mm and 35mm -- I'm not buying the 35G because I'm not sure it would be enough better than the 24-70 to justify the investment.)One advantage of Sony cameras is that you don't have to pay for in-lens stabilization again and again.  If you see Zeiss lenses costing more on Canon, for example, that is why.  (Canon does not have this lens.)If you do not have an FF camera and have no plan to get one, you may want to consider just going with the 16-50mm F2.8, at less than half the price.  I had that lens before I sold it with my A77.  The 16-50 is essentially the equivalent zoom range for APS-C, and I believe it is the best bargain in lenses anywhere.  When I pointed this out to Gary Friedman, he said he'd already reached the same conclusion.  (Gary is THE Sony camera guru.)  An advantage of the 16-50 is the size and weight, plus, for most people, it is a better APS-C zoom range.  Outside of being able to do FF, the only area in which the 24-70 optically outperforms the 16-50 is in geometric distortion.  The 16-50 has significant distortion, but the A77 will remove it.  The problem is that the A77 only outputs a jpeg when it does lens correction (Sony giveth and Sony taketh away).  DxO software is a great way to take it out of RAW images.Of course, even if you don't have an FF camera, you may want to start investing in lenses to prepare to go FF.  Remember this:  camera bodies are not a good investment, but high-end lenses are.  This lens hasn't gone up in a while and it may be due for an increase.  I'd be willing to bet it'll never go down.  The only improvement possibility is weather sealing.This lens is the centerpiece of my lens collection, which includes 3 other Zeiss lenses and 2 G lenses.  If I were starting over and could afford it, I'd buy this lens first and build around it.  If I wanted to ease into FF gently, I'd probably start with old Minolta lenses; as soon as I could afford it, though, I'd get this lens.  It is the gold standard of DSLR zooms.  If you're going to spend big bucks on FF lenses, this is where you start."],["What a pleasure creating with this bad mama jama. my photos have never been more tack sharp.everything about this lens is perfect.

I know, very stupid thing to do - I should not have been doing this in my hands but with it set on a table.  It was not a long fall, not landing on concrete, the kind of drop you've had happen with your cell phone without breaking anything.  I picked the camera up, all looked okay - whew!  But then I looked at the LCD display on the back - and it was cracked - before I'd taken one pic!  I know, this was my fault.  I'm writing this up to say, be very, very careful with this camera.  It is awesome, and very fragile.  The built in viewfinder, the pop up flash and the screen on the back are all built assuming you're going to be very, very careful.  I wish the LCD screen was covered in Gorilla glass or something else - it is so exposed on the back that if you bump it hard it's going to break.  I think there is a likelihood that with a small camera like this, it is going to get dropped, banged or crammed in a  purse or bag and the back screen is its greatest vulnerability.  A tougher back screen and this is a 5 star camera."],["I will not go into the technical details of the camera. Professional reviewers did and will review it much better than me. All I can say is that for such a small camera, and from a still-photo perspective, there is almost nothing you cannot adjust. The photo quality is amazing even at high ISO. The viewfinder and tilting screen are more than rare in such cameras. My only take, and it is not worth taking out a star, is the size. I have a Canon PowerShot S120 and it is \"pocketable.\" I am a big guy, and I can still cannot fit it in my pocket. It is still small enough though and truly worth buying."],["You can imagine camera manufacturers trying their best to squeeze every possible feature into a compact camera body while still keeping it priced reasonably. In my opinion, Sony has innovated the most and made the third iteration of the RX100 the best of the three, as well as when compared to the competition.I have both the original RX100 and the RX100M3. I bought the first model right away when it came out a couple of years ago. It is still an excellent prosumer camera in 2014 with a good, basic feature set.I did not buy the RX100M2 because I felt it did not have enough additional useful features to justify the added cost. Visually, the protruding multi-function hot-shoe also made the camera less aesthetically pleasing.I bought the RX100M3 because of the following reasons:1. The excellent Zeiss lens offering a wider wide angle (24mm) and much larger aperture (f/1.8 to 2.8) while trading off a smaller zoom range (24 to 70mm vs. 28 to 100mm), when compared to the original RX100. I use the wide end of a zoom lens much more often, and frequently in low light, so this lens is more suitable and useful for me than the one on the original RX100. For shooting in the bright outdoors, the M3 has a built-in 3-stop neutral density filter that helps to keep the aperture from stopping down for a pleasing blurred background effect.2. The built-in, pop-up Electronic ViewFinder (EVF) which allows picture-taking the traditional way (up against the eye/body for more steadiness), is useful, unobtrusive, and more convenient than an external one. It is also a necessity when the shooting environment is the sunny and bright outdoors, where the LCD screen cannot be seen clearly. An external EVF is available for the RX100M2, but beside additional bulk, it costs $450 extra. The built-in EVF is great not just for composing a shot but also for checking exposure after a shot (or a video) is taken. You can't appreciate this feature enough until you find how frustrating it is trying to compose/check a shot under a bright sun, looking at a dim and washed out LCD screen.3. An even more versatile tilt screen. The RX100M3 now allows you to take pictures from a low position, above the crowd, and of yourself. Without the protruding hot-shoe of the RX100M2, it was then possible to design the M3 screen to tilt up 180 degrees for taking selfies (self-portraits). You may be surprised how much you will use this feature now that it is possible. No need to risk asking strangers to take pictures for you anymore when you want to be included in a travel scene.4. Last but not least, the RX100M3 is a vastly better video shooter compared to the two previous models. The new BIONZ X image processor permits full-sensor readout and XAVC S compression (requires SDXC memory card class 10) for excellent quality video comparable to the Sony RX10 bridge/superzoom camera. Video frame rates now include 24p, 30p, 60p, and 120p (@720p).The RX100 series cameras utilize a 1-inch image sensor in a compact body while most point-and-shoot cameras use 1/2.3 inch sensors. A larger sensor can gather more light so its image quality tends to be better than a small sensor. But compared to 1/2.3 inch sensor cameras, a 1-inch sensor camera's lens size needs to be physically bigger and its zoom range much smaller, given a limited camera size. With these constraints, I deem it a wonder that Sony can come up with the RX100 series camera with so many features while keeping it very compact. Sony also makes cameras in the Compact System Camera (CSC) category that feature an even larger sensor (APS-C) and interchangeable lens capability, but they are not \"pocketable\" and an equivalent 24-70mm Zeiss lens costs $1,200 alone.While I have other cameras, the Sony RX100M3 IS the one that I carry with me all of the time. I suggest using Sony's well-designed LCJ-RXF jacket (ever-ready) case to carry around your RX100M3. It allows the camera to be well protected until the moment you want to use it."],["I waited patiently for 2 months to receive what is now the third version of the RX100.  I read everything about it that I could ahead of time and recognize that this is a camera enthusiasts dream.  All of the other reviews focus on the positives of the camera so no need to repeat that except to say that the build quality is excellent, the software nearly perfect and the image quality just stellar for its size.  It's a technological marvel.But, after using the camera for just a brief time, I realized that I just cannot live with the immensely small (2.9x) zoom.  It's even less than the last version.  As good as this camera is and as spectacular as the image quality ends up being, the camera is just not practical for me without more optical zoom.  It barely zooms which essentially means you have to be right up on your subject which, for me, means missing out on many shots.I get that Sony made tradeoffs to get such stellar picture quality in such a form factor and my hats off to them for their remarkable advances.  But, for me, I realized after using the camera briefly that I'd happily trade slightly less quality for much longer range.  Most compact cameras nowadays have outstanding picture quality at longer distances.I'm sure many will be extremely happy with this camera, and there's a lot to like about it, but it's just not for me."],["It's similar to the RX 100 that I've been using, except that the lens is faster and wider. But the real killer feature is the viewfinder. It's bright, sharp and easy to use. The photographic quality is outstanding. The lens doesn't go out as far as the previous versions, but at 20 megapixels it doesn't matter. You can crop the image and have plenty of resolution. You'll love the way you can flip the screen to do a selfie -- if you're so inclined. Get an extra battery -- just in case."],["Expectation:The camera should be compact so it can go anywhere, focus quickly, focus accurately, and take sharp/high quality photos that are rich in color. As an added bonus, it should take high quality video and do well in low light without a flash.With that expectation in mind, the following pros and cons were found while shooting extra fine jpeg images and AVCHD 60p 28M(PS) videos.Pros:1) Compact enough to go everywhere.2) Takes excellent photos in low light without a flash.3) Takes beautiful macro shots that are rich in detail.4) Focuses very quickly.5) The background can be forced out-of-focus to create a professional looking effect.6) Takes high quality video at 1080p.7) Easily takes panoramic shots.8) Zooming in and out is nearly silent.9) The screen flips up for self-portraits.10) The \"Fn\" button brings up a highly customizable quick menu.11) Several buttons including the control ring can be customized.Cons:1) The \"Wide\" \"Focus Area\" setting frequently results in the image, especially the center, being out-of-focus. Half pressing the shutter button will correct the issue... sometimes.2) \"Intelligent Auto\" shooting mode is not a dependable mode to leave the camera in.a. It ALWAYS uses the \"Wide\" \"Focus Area\" in this mode (see con #1).b. Scene recognition frequently selects the wrong scene. Taking an image of a car passing at 25 miles per hour results in a blurred streak.3) When the \"Center\" \"Focus Area\" setting is selected, images still lack sharpness when compared to a Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 from 2009.4) Colors are dull, especially when compared to images taken by a Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 from 2009.5) Auto white balance (AWB) sometimes produces shots that are too warm.a. If two shots are taken back-to-back sometimes one will be warm and the other accurate.6) In a space the size of a living room, using a flash at distance frequently results in overexposure.7) When shooting handheld, it's difficult to maintain the proper grip and use the control ring due to the size of the camera and lack of an actual grip.8) The screen is cluttered with an excessive amount of icons that cannot be individually shown/hidden. Given that individual icon control is unavailable, the following seem like unnecessary icons for these reasons:a. Infrequently changes: image ratio, number of megapixels, video formatb. Simply unneeded: SteadyShotSummary:There are several pros when it comes to the RX100 III but they seem to center around physical camera interaction and less frequent uses such as, low light and video. When it comes to daylight photos, which is a very frequent camera use, the bottom line is that pictures are not sharp enough or rich enough in color. Furthermore, you need to be ready to take a picture at a moment's notice and that requires a high quality and dependable automatic shooting mode that is lacking in this camera."],["Other reviewers covered the technical prowess of this camera well. It certainly lives up to its reputation. The main reason I consider this camera to be a winner is its photo quality.. even on automatic settings. I've historically been stuck between larger cameras that shot great pictures but were cumbersome to carry around and pocket-able cameras that shot underwhelming photos. This camera seems to have struck the perfect balance between quality and form.It is worth noting, as another reviewer mentioned, that the zoom is down to 24-70. IMO this is absolutely fine because most of my photos are scene-based or easily close enough for 70 to be sufficient. Perhaps less suitable if you're bird watching."],["I've owned the Mark I and Mark II. This is an expensive but compelling upgrade. If you are considering this camera I would really only look at the Mark I (Because it's small and cheap) or the Mark III. The Mark III is in a different league than the other models. It does great video with a modern codec, has a built in ND and a view finder, all super helpful when shooting video. For most uses I think the faster 24-70 equivalent lens will be more practical. The 24mm is much better for landscapes and gives you just enough for portraits. it's amazing what a difference that 4mm makes. Although the Mark III is technically bigger than the Mark II I have them both side by side and in practical use it's not noticeable at all. The removal of the hotshoe also streamlines that camera quite a bit. The Mark I is far more pocketable and if you're a casual shooter that wants a great camera that is super portable it might be a better choice. If you're an enthusiast or pro that wants the best of all worlds though I think the Mark III is simply without peer."],["So I've had a chance to use this camera for a couple of days now in NYC and I do really like it.  I'm not listing all the pros because they are listed in the product description.  The portraits and city landscape pictures I took came out great.  Don't expect to zoom in on a far away subject.  This is the camera's limitation.  For a night out with friends specially in bars and restaurants, this is a perfect camera to bring.  I prefer to use the PASM modes because the superior and intelligent auto modes wasn't working for me.  This is why I took half a star because I couldn't really just point and shoot.I don't regret buying this camera because this is the best pocket camera right now.  I just wish that the Panasonic lx8 is available now so I can at least compare.I own a micro four thirds Panasonic gx7.  I thought I can replace it with the rx100iii.  I will be keeping my micro four thirds camera."],["This is a great camera so far but the pop up flash seems so fragile.  Word of warning the glass on the LCD viewfinder is VERY SOFT it scratches very easily make sure to get a protective layer on top of it as soon as you get it unboxed!  I have carried my iphone in my purser for months and it does not have a scratch on it.  However after one day of being in my purse (without keys) it is all scratched up.  (By the way if you are thinking I should have bought a case I did but ADORAMA cameras did not send it to me and still hasn't 10 days later.  I am going to have to buy in a box and mortar store)  I would rate it 5 stars because the pics are amazing but for so much money I am worried it will break soon.  Plus I am a little peeved that someone in the camera forum says that if you call sony and ask about the camera and express doubt they will offer you a 125$ accessory bonus if you buy the camera then.  I would have liked free 125$ worth of accessories!("],["Had the original 100, and this is a step up in all ways except zoom length.  As with my first one... Extraordinarily sharp, clear, detailed and saturated photos, faster shot to shot and better low light performance.  Little heavier, little thicker, very well made.  I would easily have given up the EVF for a touchscreen... I suspect Sony knows that by now, and i have no doubt it sill be on the next model.  Cons: The flash is now a manually actuated pop up, even when forced &#34;on&#34; in the menu, which seems dumb... and not well thought out, especially since the menu hasn't changed.  Why have a forced flash menu option when you have to manually pop it up?  Form factor still REQUIRES the addition of the rubber grip, or you WILL drop it.  How Sony got that one wrong is a true mystery.  That being said, yes... I ditched my Nikon D7000 and lenses and could not be more happy, not to be lugging it all around.  Under almost every circumstance, you cannot tell the difference between the DSLR shots and the Sony.  I have been a photographer for 40 years, and this is the first real game changer that made me ditch all the gear... Its just not necessary any more.  I fully understand that this is a subjective review, not technical.  If you need that, there are many technical online reviews that come to the same conclusion.  You will not be disappointed."],["Wonderful Tiny camera.  The perfect go every where camera when you just don't have room for your DLSR, or I suppose for some a replacement for a DLSR.  Although not perfect by a long ways, limited focal length range, no hot shoe, feeble flash, it does have a lot going for it.  Two gripes:  $800 camera, and no neck strap??  Come Sony, that's just silly.  The supplied charger is also an oversight.  The ACCTRBX is the charger that should have been supplied.  The one that comes with the camera needs a cord to an outlet or a USB.  The ACCTRBX can also plug into the wall with no cord as an option, eliminating one more thing to pack for a trip.  Just figure on adding the ACTRBX and LCJ-RXF Sony case and you will have a stunning, but $1,000 point and shoot camera, that makes better images than just about anything short of a FX DLSR.  I am comparing the images to my Nikon D800, not a huge difference, and the Sony is going to get more use."],["As a big Sony fan and owner of the RX100M2, I was happy to see some features I wanted incorporated into the M3 which was the tipping point to me forking out my dough and buying this. Alas, I am disappointed.This camera does take excellent pictures and the F2.8 does well in low light situation when zoom all the way out. The ability to take 3:2 is new and the camera seems to process the picture lot faster. There are now new options for video recording format. Battery wise, it's near identical and the difference is non meaningful.  Size and weight between the M2 and M3, it's near identical. Both use the same battery and battery charger.The M3 EVF feature was one I was really looking forward to, but it's a big disappointment. Previously with my M2, I had an external EVF hooked up to it which works well but made the camera harder to carry. When you slide up the EVF the camera will automatically turn on, and when your done, you push it down and the camera lens retract and turn off. Sounds good? Not really. What Sony did not mention is that when using the EVF, not only do you have to pop it up, but you have to pull the EVF towards you to adjust the diopter EVERYTIME, else it will be out of focus. Can you imagine how inconvenience this will be? Sony should have put a small diopter dial. The other problem is that the EVF is so small it is very hard to make out any of the letters/numbers. In other words, I find the EVF practically useless..Another thing I came to dislike is the zoom. Initially I thought I would be okay with the 24mm-70mm but now I wonder why Sony didn't keep the M2's 28mm to 105mm and make it an F2.8.I'm still contemplating on keeping this camera and not sure. If you have a RX100 I would suggest the M3 is a worthy upgrade. But from M2 to M3 I'm not so sure.."],["I'll start off with the good.  I owned the Fuji x100s for about a year before I sold it.  Not becuase I didn't like it, because I did, but because it was simply too big to fit in my pocket and its weird in camera rendering to skin tones when the iso increased.  I also still own a Nikon D800 and D600 but needed something for every day photo's with family and just for fun.  This camera on paper is perfect.  Size, large aperture, 24-70mm equivalent, image stabalized AND has a revolutionary built in EVF.  When it arrived the first thing I noticed was how compact it really is.  It is a tiny camera even if the previous generations are small as well.  It seems very solid (except the popout flash which feels like I'm going to break it every time I push it back in) for being so small but at the same time there is so much packed into a tiny space I'm constantly worried I'm going to break something.  I guess that's what I get when I go from 2 full frame DSLR's to a pocket cam for travel.  Nonetheless this is a technological marvel.  My favorite feature, that incredible rotating LCD.  Awesome.  I shoot weddings with pro-level DSLR's and I can't tell you how much I appreciate the rotating LCD!  The fact I can flip it around 180 degress to take a picture with my wife and then rotate it to 45 degrees down to shoot over my head is so useful I can't recommend it enough.  We've taken more pics together since getting this camera than in the past year simply because it is easy to do.  The viewfinder is very neat but to be honest I haven't found a situation where I've wanted to use it yet (that doesn't mean that I won't but I haven't as of yet).  The image quality, in terms of focus and clarity, is excellent.  The low light results have been reasonably good up to about 1600 iso and I allow it to go up to 3200 iso sometimes if I really need a shot.  This is impressive for a camera with a sensor this small.  Now I have to mention my number one issue with this camera and the reason it gets a 4 instead of a 5 from me.....Auto White Balance.  I don't know why but every sony camera I've ever used has substantially cooler white balance than any other brand I've used.  This comes across as a slightly blue and green tint in photos.  Maybe the average consumer won't notice but I look at images all the time when I edit for weddings and these colors are off.  I know I can set multiple manual white balances with this camera but my purpose in getting this was to have a small camera for everyday use that I can shoot JPEG's with in aperture priority and have no editing to do in post.  The Auto White Balancing is, in my opinion, terrible.  My old fuji rendered significantly more accurate colors straight out of camera.  I plan to play around with the camera to see if I can globally adjust the auto white balance to a level I'm comfortable with.  If sony reads these I would encourage them to examine their AWB outputs vs the competition and release a firmware update that at least offers a second \"auto\" setting to warm up the tones across the board.  I hate to harp so much on this as the camera itself is excellent.  Hopefully I can find a way to make it work as I don't want to return the camera.  If you have a lot of experience with these cameras and know of a solution for me, I am open to input from the community as well!  The only other con to this camera is the On/Off button.  I don't know why they insisted on this being a button.  A switch would have made this a non-issue.  I accidentally turn this thing on frequently while sliding it into my pocket.  This is a scary thing to do as the lens shoots out as soon as the power goes on.  When this happens you are greeted with the unpleasant sound of the motor griding to push the lens out through your pocket.  I have to be very careful when holding the camera as you barely have to press the button to activate the power.In conclusion, fantastic small camera with some small issues.  Definitely the best pocket camera out there.  If you prefer cool tones in your images this is a no brainer.  If you prefer more realistic tones, I'll post an update if I find a way to get this thing to warm up.UPDATE: So if you don't mind shooting in the Auto modes then there is a pretty good solution.  If you click down on the rear dial it brings up a simple settings menu.  On that menu is a temperature adjustment that lets you warm up the image to your liking.  The downside is that it resets everytime you turn the camer off.  Also, that simple menu is only available under the auto modes and does not activate under the A,S or M modes.  For me, this is a good enough answer as my usage of this camera is primarily in auto mode (if I want a highly technical photo I'll probably use my D800).  No doubt this camera can do great things and has very versatile raw files but I have no desire to edit these files and it is meant to be a quick fix when I want a picture:)  I'm still not giving it 5 stars because the power button is way to easy to activate and that annoys me to no end.  Despite my feelings about the AWB and power button, this is the absolute best pocketable camera on the market by a landslide.  Nothing on the market comes close to the image quality that can still fit in your pocket.  It will not disapoint in that regard.So all said, this camera is awesome (don't sweat the small stuff).  Sony has leapfrogged the competition and I don't see any of the competitors beating this camera unless the Fuji X30 gets a 1\" sensor as well at Photokina this year and is able to maintain the size and speed of the rx100 iii.  I honestly doubt that will happen though.  Sony's improvements have been pretty awesome and I can't wait to see what they do when they have mastered their lens element fusing technique used in the rx100 iii.  Perhaps an even faster lens in the same size or maybe even an APSC sensor in a pocketable body!  Wouldn't that be awesome!  If you want a portable camera that won't let you down, this is the only game in town right now."],["Recently I went on a week-long college tour with my daughter. The RX100M3 was the perfect camera to bring along.I didn't even consider taking my D800. Even without its grip and with a 50mm prime, it was too big, too heavy, and too 'there' all the time. I adore the D800, but this was an on-your-feet, strolling in and out of buildings, across quads, and past athletic fields for hours at a time kind of day.So I bought the RX100M3. Fits right in my pants pocket. Not jeans, but khakis. I'd forget it was there, until I wanted a shot. Then I'd pull it out, get the shot, and tuck it away again.Plenty of battery life, so I had enough juice for multiple college visits in one day. Including the 'scene setter' shots of the towns they were located in.At the end of the day, the image quality was excellent. Just plain excellent. It handled a variety of mixed-lighting shots, landscapes, lecture halls, dorm rooms, architecture, and interiors.My D800 would probably have done better. But for a level playing field I would have had to bring the 24-70mm...which would have excelled. But then? The trips would have been more about the camera than the schools....and that was not what I wanted.Very happy with this little travel companion."],["I have owned this camera for a week or so, and find that the pictures I have taken come out in sharp focus, with excellent metering. I think the camera works very well as an advanced, big sensor and fast lens point and shoot.A few things to watch out for... the battery door is somewhat flimsy and will not tolerate too much rough handling. Amazing how every single camera manufacturer competes to build the thinnest door possible. The rotary dial controlling most functions appears to be OK, but is probably built to last around 3 years of heavy use and no more. The viewfinder is a great touch but here again, even though it is well built, it appears quite delicate and unlikely to tolerate rough handling. The back screen does not click back into place when you're done tilting it. I would have liked to see it click back and not just depend on friction to hold it in place. Not sure if frequent use will make the whole thing loose.Bottom line, great and expensive camera, you gotta treat it gently."],["Oh my - this camera is AMAZING.  I was a bit weary spending so much money on a &#34;pocket camera&#34; but this feature-packed camera takes better pictures than my Canon SLR that cost much more.

Its amazing they could improve on an already excellent camera, but Sony pulled it off. Personally, I am not a fan of Sony products, but they got me sold on the RX100 line. The M3 is pretty dang close to perfection. Adding a 180 degree tiltable screen, built in EVF, and 1.8-2.8 24-70mm lens really sealed the deal (and is worth the upgrade if you have one of the previous models). I gladly forked over my $800 for this bad boy. Don't forget to get the Sony protective case. Its saved my RX100M2 a many times and I'm sure it will protect my M3 as well (must buy the newer model as the previous cases are a bit too small to cover this one). Had to buy it from Crutchfield as it was backordered on here on the release date. Get these while they're hot b/c its the best pocketable camera ever made, by anyone.***Note: This is the PERFECT backup camera to my D600 with 24-70 F2.8. Since this is like 1/5 the size of that setup, I am more comfortable carrying this almost anywhere. I can get 95% the same pics during the daytime and 85% in challenging light. How awesome is that!?!"],["I loved the first RX100 until, the night of my daughter's birth, it decided not to open the camera lens, had some motor malfunction, and kept saying 'Turn power off then on&#34;.

As an avid user of DSLRs in the past, I was tired of walking around with a 5 lb weight around my neck while trying to enjoy the sights.  I have to say that the size and quality of this camera allows it to be part of my everyday routine.  Keys, Cellphone, Camera, Wallet... everything fits in my pocket and is now a necessity before leaving the house.  For my trip and during my normal routine, I take many more photos than usual resulting in many more great photos that would have never been taken without it.  No, it is not as good of an image as a DSLR, but it is dramatically better than your usual point and shoot.  I am satisfied with the quality of the 20 Megapixel images and the response time of the photos.  The wide aperture makes fantastic night shots which were impressive for my NYC fireworks display.All in all, there is one major reason for giving this 5 stars... it is a fantastic (almost DSLR quality) camera that you can fit in your pocket."],["Everylasting good"],["Have been through a dozen different digital cameras since 1999 - from DSLRs to pocket cameras. The RX100M3 strikes the best balance between portability and image quality yet. I noticed that my photo directories were becoming filled with mostly images from my Smartphone, just because I always have it with me.  I wanted a camera I could have with me as much as my phone, but could capture images my phone never could. The RX100M3 is the answer. A note about taking an $800 camera everywhere - get a Pelican 1010 and a tiny Joby tripod. I stash these in my backpack, my tennis bag, my carryon - the M3 goes everywhere with me.  Another note - you won't be able to use XAVC S video mode (including 720p slow-motion) without an SDXC card.  If you buy even a 95MB/s Class 10 32GB, it's not an SDXC. Have to go to 64GB. Not sure why Sony requires SDXC vs SDHC, but I made the mistake of getting a 32GB SDHC card and had to buy a 64GB SDXC."],["An excellent camera just got significantly better. This little jewel now sports SONYs magnificent electronic viewfinder, allowing you to see much better in bright sunlight. The LCD screen is also very good and has a &#34;Sunny Day&#34; mode, but pictures are meant to be framed through a viewfinder, and not at arm's length. This is still, and even more the best pocketable camera made by anyone. Another big new feature is the f2.8 at the long end, and if you have any of the bigger SONYs like my a7R, this new camera has a menu system that's just about the same, including that wonderful customizable Fn button. If you need a small take it with me all the time camera, there's nothing even close. Don't tell me you have a camera in your cell phone; you don't."],["I have been waiting over a month for this camera and I am excited to say, \"I LOVE IT!\". Best quality I've seen on a COMPACT CAMERA. Even on some DSLRs I've tested out. I have been bouncing back ENDLESSLY between getting a Sony A7/r, an a6000, an RX1/r (yikes!), or this camera. Keep in mind that I am not a professional photographer. On we go...Since I'm upgrading from my iPhone, I didn't want anything too big or too drastic of a change. For me, I knew I would get frustrated with having to decide what kind of lens I want, bringing the lenses, etc. But I kind of wanted that same high quality look to the pictures I was taking...something you can no doubt get with a DSLR at half the price of this camera. So it's really up to your affordability and what you're willing to sacrifice in terms of the ability to change lenses or the ability to have something compact. If you want something a bit of both, I recommend getting the a6000. A camera I was very close to getting until I found out about the RX100M3. The a6000 is the same price as the M3 INCLUDING the lens. Some notes:WiFi: I used the WiFi a LOT with this camera. I used it while I waited in line at Disneyland and during down time at sporting events. I uploaded them quickly onto my Instagram/Flickr account. It's pretty easy to set up...just make sure to read the instructions carefully. You can select the pictures you want to send to your phone/iPad and it only takes a few seconds.VIEWFINDER/LCD: One of the only reasons I bought this camera over the previous RX100 models and the RX1/r is because the viewfinder is built in instead of buying an extra $400 accessory. The viewfinder is clear and almost exactly what you see when you take the picture. I kind of wish you were able to pull out the viewfinder a bit more because my cheek touches the screen and so my makeup ends up getting on it. BUT I was still able to see the LCD screen in broad daylight with no problem. So those of you who want the cheaper RX100s and don't really need a viewfinder...by all means get the previous models. It's not that different in terms of picture quality. And the LCD is almost perfect. I just wish it was touchscreen so I can easily navigate through the different tabs on the menu screen. But other than that, I love that you can flip it 180 degrees for selfies ;)MENU: As I said in the previous paragraph, I wish I was able to touch where I want to go instead of constantly clicking through the different tabs. But the menu is pretty self-explanatory.FLASH: The pop-up flash is useful instead of buying a flash like you have to do with the previous models . Haven't found a flaw with it yet.BATTERY: Taking about 50-100 shots a day and the battery was still halfway-3/4 full. I did notice that it drained the battery significantly if I did continuous action shots.HANDLING: There is no grip on this camera, so it might be hard for people with larger hands to hold this. Sony sells an attachment grip (really a sticker) that you can put on the front. It's about $15. But I'm kind of iffy on sticking something on an $800 camera. The weight of this camera is heavier than a usual compact, but I like that. Its a good balance for my hands. Sony does sell a leather jacket case for this camera for a whopping $85. Unfortunately, you can't use both the attachment grip and the case with this camera.QUALITY: I think I've already established how great the quality is on this camera. It's comparable, if not better, than some DSLRs out there. At 20.1 megapixels, this thing is a monster. In a good way.In the end, this camera gives me everything I want and more. Ever since I've had an iPhone, I've rarely used a REAL camera...besides my GoPro (is that considered real?). And I didn't want to lug around a huge DSLR either. Now that I have this camera, I know I'll be taking this everywhere I go. I'd recommend this to anyone whether they're a beginner or not. I know some people who already have DSLRs that will purchase this as a second camera because it's so compact yet the picture quality isn't sacrificed. If you're somewhat of a beginner like me and love to learn about how things work, definitely read up on apertures, shutter speeds, ISO, etc. You'll love your camera a lot more. Anyways, can't wait to start scrap booking! :)Side note: If you plan on taking video with this camera, you have to get the 64GB Sony memory card because it records in XAVC S format. They normally retail for about $145, but I was able to get it for half off for $73. On the box: \"Use SDXC card of Class 10 or faster to take movies in XAVC S format.\"Let me know if you have any questions!"],["I bought the RX100 Mark I as my first &#34;real&#34; camera when it came out, and I was already blown away. I decided to sell the old one to get this new model, and it was definitely worth it.I won't try to list all the great things about it, since the rest of the internet has done a good job with that. I'm sure I could think of some very minor annoyances to mention, but to be honest this revision literally has everything I could ask for and more.It also *looks* beautiful, which is more than can be said for some other cameras competing on size."],["I will not bore everyone with specs and details that have already been shared in previous reviews.  Shooting experience with this pint size powerhouse is a pleasure, however, I will say that you have to know what you are doing to get the full potential of the camera unleashed.  This is not a traditional point and shoot so it is not as easy to operate (it is highly customizable).  The camera is built like a tank and is glorious to look at and the beauty if it all is people think you are just using a normal point and shoot camera, but it soooo much more than that.  I played around a lot with the camera and uncovered some cool features that I was not expecting so I was pleasantly surprised.  One of them is &#34;Eye Tracking&#34;, this technology locates the eye of a subject that is nearest the camera and uses it as the focus point so that your portrait pictures are sharp.  You enable it by pressing the center button on the camera when focusing on a person.  Another bonus feature for me was the flash, this new implementation allows you to bounce the flash all the way vertical so that you get softer light on your subject vs. pointing it directly at your subject.  The other feature I was not aware of is the focus tracking, to enable it you have to be in continuous focus mode (AFC) and then you can select Lock on AF which will then follow your subject if they move...VERY helpful for little kids that are moving...love it!I am literally blown away by the image quality on this camera.  I own another Sony DSLT with some nice glass and this rivals the picture quality on that.So here are some pros and cons:Pros:Image Quality is AMAZING!Build QualityPop-Up EVF (Did not think I would use it but in sunlight it is so useful and I found myself using it more than the LCD)Flash BounceFocusing ModesLow Light CapabilitesZeiss Glass is SUPERBConsFocal Length (Perhaps a tad too short for some people, but works for me)Minimum Focal Length - Wish that you could get in closer!Slippery Body (Get a grip for sure!)"],["Summary of my thoughts: a good \"palm sized\" camera that outperforms a smartphone but is still some distance from an interchangeable lens camera.Everyone buys a camera because they have a \"use case,\" that is one or more set of needs they'd like to have met.  I use a range of cameras, from the one in my iPhone 5s to a Leica MP film camera with a collection of prime lenses and a medium format \"folder\" camera, the Fujifilm GF670.  I am a serious amateur with a passion for shooting black and white film (which I then scan, post-process, and print or post).Though my Leica has set the benchmark for me in terms of image quality when shooting film, I enjoy the convenience of small digital cameras, particularly the one in my iPhone 5s.  I can capture an image, process it in Snapseed (convert to BW, add a touch of \"grain,\" juice up the contrast a bit), and upload it to Instagram \"in a heart beat.\"  But the iPhone lacks the ability to provide any real shallow depth of field, which I enjoy for portraits and to give images that \"3D\" appearance.  Its zoom is digital and its low light performance . . . well, it's great for a phone.I also own a Lumix GH1 with the 20mm \"pancake lens\" with a fast f 1.7 aperture.  It's marvelous . . . but not really \"palm sized\".  And fitting a zoom on it, makes it even larger.So, my dream \"palm sized\" camera is one that provides a meaningful level of shallow depth of field, functions well in low light, has some optical zoom capability, and can fit in the palm of my hand.The Sony RX100M III does MOST of these things . . . it fits perfectly in the palm of my hand, has a moderate zoom, does very well in low light, and has an acceptable though not outstanding shallow depth of field capability.  While the lens IS an  f1.8 aperture (and that get's the heart racing if you're an old film buff like me), it's mated to a 1 inch sensor, which is a long way from a full frame sensor.  So while the low light capture capability is nice, the shallow depth of field?  Meh.  Unimpressive.  Once you begin moving towards 50mm field of view, the aperture has dropped to nearly f 2.8 on a 1 inch sensor and \"subject isolation\" is scant to non-existent.You might ask: why not get an Sony RX1 or RX1r?  Besides the fact that it's nearly 4X the price, it doesn't zoom.  And don't give me the \"zoom with my feet\" lecture . . . I own a collection of Leica primes and I get that part really well.  It's just I'm getting a bit lazy in my \"old age\" and prefer more \"reach\" to the optics :-)I'm not a purist who shoots only RAW.  When I really get fixated on information density in an image, I shoot an ISO 50 speed film in my medium format camera and scan it to get a 500 Gb file.  Lots of data . . . but I'm not a pixel peeper so if the jpeg output of my digital camera is decent, I'm happy.  And the jpeg output of the Sony RX100M III is excellent.And for the black and white film purists out there, fasten your seat belt: the high contrast monochrome setting on the Sony will knock your socks off!  I'm tempted to call the Sony RX100M III a \"Mini Monochrom\", Leica's $8,000 black and white only digital camera.  There are two other monochrome settings to use as well but I am having lots of fun with the high contrast setting.  Is the sensor really as good as Leica's?  No, of course not.  But it is VERY good for the size and price.The zoom range is nice: 24-70mm.  To be honest, I'd like it to reach 100mm like the earlier models but then I'm not ready to trade the smaller aperture for that ;-)A couple of other features I enjoy: you can shoot video in black and white . . . but I should point out that the sound of zoom \"motor\" is audible in the recording.  Second, there is a built in ND (neutral density) filter that is automatically \"turned on\" if, like me, you are seeking to shoot with the lens \"wide open\" in sun light.  When using the Aperture priority mode (and auto ISO), the camera will step down the ISO and increase the shutter speed to accommodate a wide open lens.  But if that is not enough, it will engage the ND filter to enable you to \"open up the lens.\"  This is a very nice feature.Finally, the built in WiFi transfer is serviceable for iOS devices.  I don't fault Sony that Apple doesn't support NFC but the interface on Sony's iOS app is pretty weak.  That being said, I now routinely transfer images from my camera to my iPhone or iPad.  If anyone's having trouble with the process, ask a question on this \"review\" and I'll be happy to take you through the precise sequence that works nearly 100% of the time.  (Rube Goldberg was Sony's software consultant).So if you have a use case that is similar to mine, I'd recommend the camera.  Or you can wait about 3-5 years or so and Sony will put a full frame sensor in an $800 palm size camera, with a zoom and a fast lens.  And I'll own one :-D"],["5 stars because this small camera is the best in its class (DP Review gives it their coveted Gold Award). This camera will NOT replace a high quality DSLR camera, but then again, you cannot put a high quality DSLR in your pocket.  The lens is fast for this class of camera, and the EVF makes the camera eminently useable ... composing your photo holding a compact camera at arms-length to see the rear LCD screen in distracting sunlight glare gets old really fast.  This Sony has a hidden attraction: putting the camera into Manual mode allows you to create a new exposure mode: a &#34;Shutter-Aperture-Priority&#34; mode a-la-Pentax, which can come in handy - even my Canon DSLR can't to THAT.  If you like to hike with your compact camera, consider taking along a monopod that can double as a hiking stick. The increased stability provided with the monopod can make your pix just a tad more crisp.  This camera does not have a touch-sensitive screen but I don't really need that. Verdict: Quality photographs from a &#34;pocketable&#34;, well-built camera. Well done Sony."],["HARDWAREYou'll still get better performance from a top-of-the-line mirrorless camera or DSLR, but those aren't nearly as portable, and they're certainly not small enough to carry in your pocket. The RX100 is plenty capable, but its greatest strength is its size. While heavier than many other point-and-shoots, it's not much larger. Its powerful 24-70mm f/1.8-2.8 Vario-Sonnar T* zoom lens does make it quite a bit thicker than your run-of-the-mill compact, but assuming you can deal with a moderate bulge, it can fit in a pants pocket.You'll more likely be dangling the RX100 III from your wrist, using the included band, or from a third-party neck strap (the requisite adapters are in the box). Despite its small size, however, the camera offers all of the necessary buttons and dials, including a dedicated mode dial, a video record button, a scroll wheel (for adjusting aperture and/or shutter speed) and a button for accessing the integrated WiFi mode, which lets you transmit images from the camera directly to a smartphone or a tablet.This time around, the greatest engineering feat is the pop-up electronic viewfinder. It's located at the far-left corner, and extends up about one inch when in use. The clever design includes a slide-out magnifier, complete with a diopter adjustment dial. The camera powers on as soon as you extend the EVF using the release switch on the left side of the housing, though it also turns off when you push it back down. Like most other EVFs, there's a proximity sensor that activates the finder and disables the LCD when you raise it to your eye. Of course, grazing the viewfinder with a finger or other appendage has the same effect, but you can simply push it back into the housing to eliminate the issue.Because the EVF takes up quite a bit of space within the housing, Sony had to move the pop-up flash a bit to the right. It's now centered just above the lens, though it extends far enough to reach beyond the zoom, even at the widest focal length. Given that the flash has now taken over the real estate previously allocated to the full-size hot shoe, that component is a casualty of the RX100's redesign, though (as mentioned earlier) with the exception of perhaps a few hardcore shooters, it likely won't be missed.USER INTERFACEFor a spell, Sony began including touchscreens with its mirrorless cameras, such as the NEX-5N, but newer models, including the Alpha 6000 and flagship A7s don't offer that feature. All three RX100 models also lack touch functionality, including this year's iteration, which may be a disappointment to some. On the other hand, no touchscreen means Sony needed to include a range of dedicated controls and dials, which ultimately work to improve the experience. The trade-off, of course, is that you can't tap to focus, which many shooters have come to count on when capturing video.The user interface hasn't changed much since the original RX100. The menu layout is more or less identical, though there have been some slight cosmetic tweaks. The quick-access menu has been refined -- it's a bit more straightforward to use now -- but indicators and the camera's general workflow are consistent with past models. Like with the RX100 II, you can transfer images over WiFi using Sony's PlayMemories Mobile app for smartphones and tablets, but unlike competing products, you can't control the camera remotely.PERFORMANCE AND BATTERY LIFEThe first model in this series was lauded for its incredibly fast focusing, and the RX100 III performs just as you'd expect. It focuses very quickly, and it's accurate nearly all of the time. Focus hunting is perceptible, particularly with dim subjects when you're not using the AF-assist light, but if you miss a shot due to speed, the camera probably won't be to blame. Granted, it's not the fastest gun in the West, but it's definitely one of the best in its class. As with any compact camera with a power zoom lens, it takes a second or two to get the camera powered on and ready to capture its first shot. If you're anticipating an upcoming capture, it's best to leave the RX100 powered on -- once the camera's standing by, shutter lag is barely noticeable.As for battery life, I took the RX100 on vacation and managed to get through three days of exploring without charging up. On average, I probably used the camera for a few hours each day, so if you tend to capture hundreds of shots and dozens of video clips during each day of touring, you'll need to charge up overnight. During that period, I was able to snap more than 500 stills and 13 minutes of 1080p/60 video, which was captured with the high-bit rate (and processor-intensive) XAVC S codec.IMAGE QUALITYSince we're already on the topic of video, I'll start with some analysis there. The XAVC S codec available with Sony's latest cameras is a significant step up from AVCHD. Video looks great on the camera, of course, but when evaluating footage on a laptop, it's hard to believe this level of quality came from a camera you can slip in your pocket. The new f/1.8-2.8 lens also deserves some of the credit, I'm sure, but the improvement is clear. The one con is that you'll need to use a file converter to edit and output your footage using a computer. I used Pavtube ($35), which worked very well.Unfortunately, once you convert footage and upload it to the web (with further compression), you lose a lot of that captured detail. The resulting clips, as you'll see in the footage reel above, look better than what you'd shoot with some other compact cameras, but unless you're maintaining that high 50 Mbps bit rate, you'll notice some degradation for sure. In the reel above, exposure was spot-on, and the RX100's integrated optical image stabilization helped keep things steady, even as I moved around.WRAP-UPWhen Sony launched its first RX100 back in 2012, we were very impressed. The camera offered tremendous functionality in a pocketable package. Then, when the RX100 II came around last year, Sony added WiFi along with a full-size hot shoe (which can accommodate high-end audio gear, among other accessories), besting the original model. This year's iteration is by far the most capable yet, with a superior lens, XAVC S encoding and a unique pop-up EVF. At $800, it's a significant investment, particularly within the point-and-shoot category, but if you need a ton of power in your pocket and you don't mind paying for it, you can't do any better than this."],["WHERE I'M COMING FROMI would describe myself as an advanced beginner and (I confess) a pixel peeper. I was looking for a small camera that I can tuck into my purse when it's not practical to bring my Canon 70D for everyday still shots. I had picked up a used Canon PowerShot SX260 compact camera for this purpose; however, certain manual features (for example, focusing manually, setting a specific focus point, or locking exposure to recompose a silhouette) were not intuitive, slow to implement, or nonexistent, and I quickly got frustrated. I gave the SX260 to my husband, closed my eyes and took a deep breath, and wrote the hefty check for the RX100 III.FIRST IMPRESSIONSWhat I lost in the telephoto reach of the SX260 I gained in other technical aspects that are important to me at this time. Right out of the box, I could pop into aperture mode (for example), spin a dial to change aperture, press a button to set exposure compensation, and, using another button, quickly access other functions such as ISO, drive and focus mode, and white balance. When I wanted quick access to a function that wasn't on the Fn screen, I just replaced one of Sony's choices with one of my own. When I wanted a super-quick way to set a specific focus point, I just set a custom key to pop me right into the Flexible Spot focus area mode (how cool is that, for a compact camera?). This camera really seems like a full-fledged dSLR, in miniature.IMAGE QUALITYI mostly shoot raw. This camera's .ARW files are recognized in Lightroom with the 5.5 update. I tried the RAW + JPG setting to compare the two formats; I'm impressed with the quality of the JPGs that come straight out of the camera.I don't have a particularly steady hand, and I'm finding that I end up with more keepers using this camera than the 70D in similar situations, maybe because of its lighter weight and brighter lens. Even shots I took from the back of a motorcycle, at speed, came out surprisingly crisp.My aim here is not to compare camera specs but to offer my impression of overall image quality and the ease with which I can obtain an image that pleases me, no matter which camera I'm using. I've spent countless hours viewing my images at 100% and beating myself up over shots that I missed because I moved, or focused on the wrong thing, or couldn't get the camera to do what I wanted at that moment. The point is that I'm pleased with the results I'm getting with this little camera, and now that I'm getting more consistent results I can stop obsessing over the technical aspects of my gear and concentrate on what I think making photographs is all about--composition, mood, and lighting. I'm excited!OTHER RANDOM OBSERVATIONS- The documentation for this camera is pretty sparse, but I've picked up some great tips from helpful contributors on various user forums.- Personally, I don't mind that this camera &#34;only&#34; reaches a zoom of 70mm. I think it will make me a better photographer in the long run. In the meantime, I can crop in Lightroom if I missed an opportunity to get up close. I don't print larger than 8x10 prints, so cropping won't be a problem for me.- I had gotten used to the touchscreen on my dDLR, but I don't miss having a touchscreen on the RX100 because accessing functions is speedy enough with the Fn button.- I love the viewfinder and the control ring around the lens. I think these features help me hold the camera much steadier than having it positioned out at arm's length in front of me, like I was doing with the SX260.- I like that the flash tilts so it can be bounced off of the ceiling instead of pointed directly at one's hapless subjects. It's a bit odd that the camera lacks a mechanism to hold the flash in a desired position, however. This makes it seem like a happy accident for Sony rather than a deliberate feature.Hope this helps someone with similar expectations and shooting style make their purchase decision."],["This camera is simply the most amazing little camera every made. I shoot with a Fujifilm X-T1 and a 23mm, 10-24mm, 35mm and 55-200mm. That's a lot to carry around. I've been reading the reviews of this camera, and a few of my friends have them. I finally decided to join the party and I am not disappointed. This camera takes amazing photos. Just amazing.

It is charging as I am writing this so I will let you know how my first pictures turn out.  Great service, Amazon."],["I'm now on my third DSC-RX 100 version: the Mk III. I also own a Canon 5D Mk III and a Leica M9, but the great truism is that your photo is only as good as the camera you happen to have with you. Hence a lot of photos today are taken using smartphones and every one of them is better than the photo you would never have taken if you didn't have a camera in hand!The RX 100 is arguably the best compact camera on the market, on balance. And the Mk III outshines its predecessors in the following ways:* The effective image quality is improved. It uses exactly the same sensor as the Mk II but it has a stop or more advantage as you zoom in and that simply means that a photo that would have been captured at, say, 400 ISO is now captured at 200 ISO. (The lower the ISO the less noise). Richard from Boston, respectfully: all three versions have the same F1.8 lens at the widest focal length. It is as you zoom that the maximum F stop decreases: from F4.9 in the prior versions at 100mm (35mm equivalent) focal length, to F2.8 in the current version but at a maximum focal length of only 70mm.* The zoom range is reduced but extended at the wide angle end: 24mm-70mm (35mm equivalent) from 28mm-100mm in the prior versions. This is a big plus for me but maybe less so for others. I used to use Panasonic/Leica LX compacts (same friggin' camera but you pay at least 2X for the Leica label and Leica's product design - the plastic casing - is more than 2x better than Panasonic's) that had a 24mm-90mm (F1.4-F2.8) lens and I really missed the 24mm widest angle when I moved to Sony. So, why did it take so long for Sony to catch up with Panasonic? Fact is, Sony's sensor is much, much bigger than Panasonic's. This translates to superior performance, but makes it much harder to make bright zoom lenses for such a compact camera. (Consider how large lenses are on a DSLR.)* The EVF is fantastic. I've been using SLRs for 50 years, literally, and the greatest advantage to a viewfinder in my opinion is that it anchors the camera to your face and you end up with a more stable camera and a lower required shutter speed which translates into a lower ISO and better image quality.  This EVF is 'only' 1.44 megapixels, versus 2.44 in their higher end cameras, but both look absolutely 'real' (as if you were looking through an optical viewfinder for the most part with the larger pixel space simply 'looking' larger through the view finder.)Other advantages include a better menu structure and a dedicated flash on button - which is a big deal from my POV. Also a rear screen that can flip up completely for selfies.Any way you look at it, the Sony RX-100 is a fantastic camera in any version, but the Mk III is the most impressive.Bravo, Sony!PS: all there versions have a pivoting flash that allows one to bounce the flash off a ceiling. The results are so much better than direct flash. It really delivers vastly superior flash photos assuming you have fairly light and low ceilings. (Only really works in landscape orientation where the flash pivots up. The Mk III pivot also goes much further (beyond straight up), and the only downside of the whole line is the flash time which is on the slow side."],["Great camera. I have both the original and the new one. Viewfinder is very good quality but LCD is so good I only need it 10 to 15 percent of the time. Smaller zoom range has not been an issue for my applications. My only complaint is not as much easy focus control. You can get there but it is a bit of work."],["If you want a good point and shoot then this is a waste of money. This camera takes great pictures but you have to manually adjust the setting and know what you're doing.For full auto it's not worth it and you can get similar quality for the fraction of the cost.The size is compact, it's feature rich, and the pictures can be great. However on full auto the camera often focuses on the wrong subject, the white balance is not always good indoors, and the pictures aren't impressive.."],["I bought this camera because of its faster lens (f/1.8 to f2.8), which means, to me,  more light entering onto the cameras sensor which, in turn, means to me slightly better images than previous models. Which translate to a shallower depth of field available.  And that's exactly what I like and want in this model, and precisely why I bought it, even though I also have the previous M2 model.  One thing I want to note here before I go on.  The Aperture seems to move quite fast from 1.8 to 2.8 thru the smaller zoom range.  In that, a case could be made that this lens is more of a steady 2.8 thru out the zoom range.So then what exactly did I get with this upgrade from my M2 to my new M3?  Well, you've got the newer Bionz X processer.  The new 180 degree LCD (for Selfies if you are so inclined).  The pop-up EVF (which is an innovation in and of itself, and a help with image stabilization when pressed against my face).  Zebra pattern and focus peaking which is available on my RX10 and now the M3.I feel the 24mm-70mm lens (though not the same reach as my previous M2 model - 28-100mm) is a good walk-around lens. And since I have been using this same zoom range for a long time on my DSLRs, I feel very comfortable with this zoom range in a very capable and now compact camera.  When I use this for portraits at the long end of 70mm I expect to shoot mostly 1/2 to 3/4 body shots to full body shots.  As opposed to the previous models zoom range of 28-100mm where I used it up to head and shoulder shots at the long end.This camera has the same  Bionz X processor that Sony has in their A7 line of cameras (one of which, the A7R, that I have).  That was another plus for me in buying this camera.  As far as image stabilization, it is important to compact cameras today and thus, to me.  And I find that holding the camera up to my face while using the EVF gives me the 'feel' of a more stabilized shot.  And my pictures look better to me.  This is important to me because now that I am in my 60's, try as I might, holding the M2 or my smartphone without an EVF - is not as steady as I'd like it to be or as I remember it was when I was younger.  And I need image stabilization in lower light.  And this EVF on my new compact M3 seems to provide that for me.  The only 'unofficial' (perhaps non-technical) test I could do with this camera was to zoom it out to 70mm, and hold the shutter half-way to see how much 'lock' I had on the image.  Then I tried it with my M2.  My observation was that I did see an improved difference with the M3.There is a slight difference in camera size from the previous model (which I also have).  The thickness of this model is about 2mm more.  And the weight is about 8 to 9 grams more.  What this also means in terms of fitting a leather case to it is that my previous models Sony leather case will not fit this camera.  You're going to need the Sony LCJRXF/B Premium Jacket Case (Black).  This new case will fit all previous models as well as this model.  Just as the Sony LCJRXC/B Premium Jacket Case (Black) would only fit the M2 as well as the M1.  Some people think that the case for the M2 will also fit the M3.  It will not.  I have tried it.  I also recommend the custom camera grip by Richard Franiec (camera accessories by Richard Franiec).  This goes for about 35$ and is worth its weight in gold - to me.  It is far better than the Sony grip that I used on the M2 for 15$. Its made of metal (anodized aluminium) is sleek looking, feels good quality and solid, and gives you a good grip on the camera while still maintaining the cameras pocketability (because it doesn't protrude past the lens assembly).  Of course with the camera grip added, the M3 will not fit in the Sony Leather  camera case.  So it is either one or the other. So to get around this I ordered another OP/TECH USA Soft Pouch Digital D-Micro (Black) for my M3 which I also have for the M2.  And it fits great.If my review was any help with your decision to purchase, and I hope I was of some help, kindly choose 'Yes' in the comments section below.  Thank You.  Richard"],["...in fact, despite the fact the RX100M3 actually fits comfortably in a pants pocket, jacket pocket, or shirt pocket, its one of the best cameras anyone has made at any size.  I'm a landscape photographer, and the superb pop-up eyepiece viewfinder puts this pocket camera in a class by itself. It virtually eliminates the difficulties associated with shooting outdoors in bright light while relying on a flat display screen. Combined with Sony's new processor, which is virtually identical to that on Sony's excellent RX10 and A6000 cameras, and coupled with a new highly efficient (f1.8-2.8) lens, this little widget's relatively large sensor produces shockingly sharp images with unsurpassed color realism. The image stabilization is so good I find I can get finely focused hand-held shots even at shutter speeds as low as 1/15.  The smooth motorized zoom on the 24-70mm lens is great for stills and ideal for movies. I often shoot in manual mode, and using the large, easy to handle ring on the lens to adjust aperture (while the viewfinder displays the precise results in real time) is simply a joy: the experience is so intuitive. I bought the first generation RX100 when it was released and though image quality was impressive I found myself wishing it had an electronic eyepiece viewfinder (like the A77 and A99's I was using at the time.)  That wish has been fulfilled with the third-generation RX100M3.  My highly valued iPhone 5s (a capable camera to be sure) is getting increasingly nervous the longer I write, so I'll quit now."],["Today's compact cameras offer (almost) no advantage over the smartphone cameras. SLR cameras and the new generation mirrorless cameras (such as Sony NEX) do provide better quality but are too large and heavy to schlepp around unobtrusively. The RX100 is a camera that is pocketable while giving a dramatic quality advantage over an iPhone 5s. Its beats the larger NEX camera in nearly every aspect. And it is equal or better than bulky SLR cameras (unless you need a true zoom capability).Amazon sent my pre-ordered RX100-3 just in time before leaving on a vacation to Spain. This offered a great opportunity to test my brand-new camera under many different conditions: in dark churches, bright beaches, city panoramas, pictures in musea, selfies, concert videos, etc. After shooting over 700 pictures I am more enthusiastic about this camera than any camera I have owned until now. The pictures are very good. The RX100-3 seems to do most everything right. On top of that, it feels great in the hand as its made of high-quality materials.It shoots razor sharp pictures that are a feast for the eye. The quality difference is immediately apparent when viewed on an retina-display iPad. Thanks to the large 1\" image sensor and F1.8 lens it can crank up the ISO without introducing noise, resulting in spectacular low-light capabilities. I hardly used the flash as there is little need with such great hardware. In bright sunlight the built-in ND filter allows to perform some background defocussing.The built-in viewfinder is unique and turns out to be very useful in practice, especially if you need reading glasses such as myself. Popping it out automatically switches the camera on, popping it back in switches it off again. The regular LCD screen can be tilted 180 degrees to shoot selfies, which is a nice touch. Apropos touch: the LCD screen is not. All controls are with tiny buttons, making for s steep learning curve given the many options of the camera. Sometimes I accidentally pushed one of those buttons, and it turns out to be hard to quickly recover from that. This camera is not for you if you are easily intimidated by options and buttons, or prefer a zen/Apple style minimal user interface. To make things worse, the built-in help feature is borderline useless. One has to consult the paper manual to understand what the DRO1 or HDR3 is, and what the sweet spot for each is.The easy to grip ring around the lens controls the zoom, focus or exposure (depending on the shooting mode). Compared to the RX100-2, the ring operation is much faster, allowing for smooth zooming. The default 24mm is nicely wide-angle, great for most shots. In some situations a slight zoom in is better to prevent the unavoidable distortion from becoming noticeable. Maximum zoom is only 70mm, which makes this camera no suitable for birdwatchers. I do not mind as most of my shots did not require zoom. I enabled the digital zoom to get a little more zoom range. Given the super high resolution the penalty is not too bad.It is strange that all expensive cameras lack GPS geotagging and easy connectivity. The good news is that the RX100-3 has a built in wifi which avoids messing with adapters and wires.  I used it many times to send pictures to my smartphone and iPad. That still requires a bit too many button clicks, but it does work well and does not depend on external wifi network.I did not have the time to read the manual, but I discovered a few other interesting features in the past 2 weeks of shooting:- It has a built-in 'beautification' tool for those hedonistic selfies: skin smoothing, eye-widening, teeth whitening and more. It worked remarkable well even though it seems a bit of a marketing gimmick.- Sweep panorama pictures can be shot either horizontally or vertically. I found the vertical sweep panorama to be an excellent way to get a wide-angle view without much distortion. All panoramas are shot at 1/500s.- I still need to figure out when to use 'intelligent auto' and when 'superior auto'. If seems that superior auto is more creative with HDR (multi-exposure) in high contrast situations.- The built-in flash can be aimed upward to the ceiling, resulting in a softer effect.- The viewfinder can show an artificial horizon that helps shooting straight pictures.- Digital zoom has 3 modes: 'off', 'clearimage', and 'on', where 'clearimage' seems to cleverly adjust zoom range to avoid too much resolution loss. (I have not read the manual yet ;)- Battery life turns out to be quite good. I short over 200 pictures on a day and still had 20% battery left.- The camera has a tendency to focus on the front object and defocus the background in auto-mode. That is great for portraits, but not always what is intended. Forcing a larger depth-of focus seems to require using the A or S modes instead.The RX100-3 is probably the best portable camera currently on the market."],["amazing camera with fantastic features and great photos!"],["I've owned both the RX100 and RX100M II. The RX100M III is a major improvement over previous versions.To highlight some improvements and changes:1) The Wi-Fi/Smart Remote app works betterWhen you power cycle the camera after turning on Wi-Fi, the Wi-Fi is already enabled. In other words, you can turn the cam off, then back on, and the Wi-Fi is connected and ready to go.Depending on your shooting mode, you now have the ability to change certain settings via the Wi-Fi such as exposure.The overall connection is much, much better. With the RX100M II, the connection constantly drops, lags, disconnects, etc. There is still some of the with the M III, but not nearly as bad.2) Better VideoDealing with AVCHD/.mts files is a pain. The XAVC/.mp4 format is amazing and allows recording at 50mbps. The quality is out of this world.3) More stabilization optionsThey've included a new &#34;Intelligent Active&#34; mode which has a pretty big crop factor. I don't recommend using it unless you have to (such as riding a bike on gravel). I suggest using Standard mode or leaving it off if possible, allowing for the least amount of crop and better quality. Noise levels on Active and Inteliigent Active are noticeably high.4) Better exposure/metering and focusingThe problem with the RX100M II is that it has problems with focusing on the foreground. You had to go into macro mode, which is a pain and not suitable for video. It also has problems with exposure and brightening subjects that are against bright lights. The RX100 MII improves on all of these issues.I highly recommend this camera for video. It's hands down the best handheld camera for video in this price range.Suggestions to Sony:A backlight compensation function to further improve brightening subjects that are against lights. I still found shots that would be ruined because the camera would darken a subject in the foreground to highlight everything in the background. Very annoying!"],["This is simply the best pocket camera there is right now. As a pro photographer and having used a previous generation RX100 I have to say this latest version is simply amazing. I only just received it so bear in mind this is a first impression review.PROS:- The 24/70 lens with f1.8/2.8 max aperture is outstanding (a very nice upgrade from the last two RX100 models)- Very good high iso performance for a camera this size- Quick start time- Full hd video with really good image stabilization- NFC/Wifi (actually quite useful if you want to quickly post a nice quality pic to instagram)- The new customizable FN menu is very convenient- Built-in ND filter- USB charging (one less charger to keep track of, yes!)- Flip screen (with selfie mode)- Amazing camera that actually fits in my pocket (I pretty much take it everywhere)- Sony fixed the image/video browsing from the previous versions, they can be seen together instead of having to load a still or video folder to see each type of in playback mode.But nobody's perfect! There are a few minor CONS, some which already existed in the previous models and some which hopefully can be fixed via a BIOS update (one can always hope!)- Closing the view finder shuts down the camera, which doesn't make sense. Either disable this or make it an option in settings.- The screen is not touch-screen. I mean at this point almost everything is touch screen, this just seems like a strange oversight in such an amazing camera. This is especially missed when zooming in/out during playback. Not an absolute must have but would be nice.- Picture effects cannot be disabled. Some are actually useful (high contrast mono for example) while others are completely useless. But since you can't select which picture effects are enabled you have to scroll through all the options every time. (previous RX100 also had this annoying problem). It's a pretty minor issue though.- I wish the NFC/Wifi connect was faster, it&#8217;s not slow but one would hope could be made faster. I guess the connection time is mostly taken by having the phone change wifi settings, not sure if there ever could be a way around that.And a suggestion for the next generation:- Camera size: while it&#8217;s amazing sony was able to fit such a good lens in such a small package (and it does fit in my pockets), each version of this camera has increased very slightly in size and weight. I hope the next version could be downsized a bit - slimmer would be nice to be more easily be pocketable. Or maybe offer two versions, the standard one with all the bells and whistles and an &#34;rx100 mini&#34; version (no flip screen and no viewfinder) with a slimmer profile?"],["I hesitated at the RX100 and RX100 MKII because of the 28mm lens. I was excited for the Canon G1X MKII until I heard just before it launched, the Sony RX100 MKIII was coming out. I'm glad I waitedI would have bought the RX100 MKIII even without the built in EVF which by the way is amazing not pixelated at all like the Sony A7r. I'm not going to go into the entire specs as you know if your reading this what i'm talking out, however, this camera I've been waiting for since the Panasonic LX3.This is a 3 to 5 year one to beat on upgrade in my opinion. Well done Sony!"],["This is a great 1&#34; sensor camera.  Small enough to put in your pocket, yet much better results than cameras in this size class.Things I love about this new revision:-Excellent and very useful EVF.  Slides back into Camera when not in use-Screen can go 180 for self-portraits or to monitor when using video-Normal Burst Mode shoots good qualityImprovements from the Mark II except for the following:1) Hot Shoe detachment has been removed. This is a big disadvantage when using the camera for video.  I was unable to attach a microphone or light units easily because of this.  Sony should integrate the flash into the body (Like the panasonic LF1) and return the Hot Shoe.2) Lens aperture has been improved, but you lose some telephoto range.  While this isn't a huge disadvantage for everyday shooting, it is when you consider you can't remove the lens on this camera.Things I would like to see:i) For the amount of money your paying for this camera, it would be a much better value if they changed the lens to a 5x version with either 24-120 or 28-140mm equivalent. There is Sony's Clearzoom that gives you an extra 2x of reach, but I wouldn't go beyond that and use the digital zoom because the image suffers too much.ii) It would be nice if it was touchscreeniii)No GPS functionsDon't let this cameras small size fool you. It's a great backup/B Camera that I would consider a professional instrument.  I hope Sony addresses some of these issues with the Mark IV or creates a spin-off like the RX100 IC in which you can change out the lenses.  I'd love to be able to have a Prime Lens, 28-140 and telephoto I could install.  The Nikon 1 V3 is doing this already, but the price is too much right now."],["Great image quality in both low light and outdoors. Both construction and design are both tops The new DSP and sensor are amazing togeather and allow for all the new formats for video as well as real burst shooting of photos in both RAW and JPEG. Virtually no shutter lag (.8 seconds) as in most pocket sized point & shoot models. Everything that displays on the rear LCD screen is also displayed in the EVF and the 3&#34; LCD shuts off automatically when your face touches the screen when using the EVF as well. I highly recommend getting the MAGfilter circular polarizing filter to eliminate reflected harsh light and the protective case only adds a few MM to the overall size so it's still a pocketable camera.only slightly thicker than an Iphone and still protected from dings, dents and scratches.. One drawback is the thin wriststrap but if you get the case, you can install a really fine wrist strap from Joby that will secure both the camera to the case and also securely to your wrist. Sony supplies small loops for the securing of the case to the camera and the metal stays on the case can support a good JOBY wrist strap (almost a &#34;must have&#34; if you have large hands and fingers).This model comes in second to the $7000 Leica for quality and performance in the point & shoot category at 1/10th the price. I got this camera to replace the old Nikon S-8300 for my wife and she's thrilled with the performance and features."],["Met all of my expectations that I had read about beforehand. Image quality is very good. Operational controls are mostly intuitive. Love the size (that's why I bought it). Slips easily into my pocket. The viewfinder is very sharp. The only thing I wish it had is a  larger zoom capability."],["PROs and CONsPROs:-Excellent image quality. The new lens is noticeably sharper than the previous lens. Detail capture is very good. Slight tendency to overexpose. Colors are a bit neutral but mostly accurate in its default setting. Comparable performance to APS-C up to ISO800. Usable through ISO3200, especially if you process RAW. ISO performance about this same as its predecessor. Possibly slightly worse at high ISO than the Canon G1X Mark II but not that far off.-Good performance. Autofocus speed and accuracy seems to have improved on this model. The AF system does a better job of attempting to lock on to a subject in dim conditions. Image stabilization works well.-Great looking video. About the best you're going to find from a compact camera.-Pop up EVF is sharp and bright, and has a decent refresh rate even in low light conditions.-LCD is bright and clear.CONs-Camera shuts off after EVF is put away.-Manual flash button in an awkward position and can sometimes be hard to push.-Still no textured area on the front of the camera for a more secure grip. Come on Sony! Although the previous add on grip fits just fine on the RX100 III. You should not order this camera without it (I think it's about $10-$15 extra).-Menu is a little convoluted.In summary, this is a great update to this line of cameras. It still offers the best mix of high image/video quality for such a small package. Despite the quirks I just mentioned, the camera is generally pretty enjoyable to shoot with and the photos/video give similarly priced APS-C cameras a run for their money at the low and mid range ISOs people use most. If you have the original RX100, should you upgrade? Yes, absolutely. If you have the RX100 II? Well, the lens isn't as sharp but still pretty good. Low light performance is exactly the same. But perhaps you like the longer lens and the hotshoe of the Mark II and don't care about the EVF...then it might be worthwhile to skip a generation. Is the RX100 III worth the extra money? I think it is."],["This is the camera I have been waiting a looooong time for.I am a professional photographer who does a lot of work overseas. So I find myself traveling with all of my camera gear packed into my Thinktank rolling bag and always have liked to have a small fast camera to use in case I saw something I wanted to shoot. Be it something that just peaked my interest or even if I was on a flight where the flight attendant decided to strip naked, swig a bottle of champagne, and then deploy the emergency shoot and run away (no that has not really happened on any flights I've been on, but, you know, it could).I wanted to be able to make a picture of something if I needed/wanted to without having to drag my roller out of the overhead and pull a camera out or feeling like the image quality would suffer because of the compromise of having a smaller point and shoot camera. But every other P/S camera I have used over the years left me feeling just that way... it was an image quality compromise either because the sensor was not very good or because the lens was slow, or the camera was painfully laggy.So I usually ended up carrying one of my Canon 5d mkIII bodies over my shoulder with the 24-70 on it... which is also not an ideal solution because you have to take it through security and try to keep it from swinging around while carrying bags, etc... then you have to find somewhere to put it once you get on your flight.Then I saw this camera... and fell in love with it. The image quality is amazing. It has a sharp and fast Zeiss lens 24-70 f1.8-2.8, fast and accurate autofocus, great fps rate (if you need it), and absolutely knockout image quality. I actually used this to shoot some work for a client (alongside my regular pro gear) and a liked a couple of the images so much that they made it into the edit and it is hard to tell the difference between the images shot with pro dslr's and the RX-100M III.This is also the perfect vacation camera or for trips with the kids where I don't want to lug my work gear. It is small and light but is good enough to shoot just about anything that they end up doing on a daytrip/vacation.I have been very pleased with the battery life on this camera. It seems to go an awfully long time for such a small battery.I also like how easy it is to operate settings like exposure compensation, flash modes, etc. on this camera. It takes seconds and minimal button pushing to reach most of the features one regularly accesses on a small camera like this. Sony really thought this through when designing it.I can't say enough about how good the image quality is. I have not shot the camera in jpg mode, only in raw, but in some very tricky lighting situations (kids in mid-day sun wearing hats on carnival rides) where you would expect a point-and-shoot to stumble, the Sony produces an image with more than enough latitude to burn and dodge a bit to end up with an amazing image. Color looks good as does the contrast. It seems to do a great job with white balance in less than ideal light, too.Finally, the perfect carry-around small camera to compliment my pro gear has arrived."],["Before I placed my order for this camera, I tried to avoid going through the same scenario that I experienced once I discovered the deal-breaking limitations of the RX10 (see my review). One of them was the inability for the camera to capture still photos while shooting video. I contacted Sony Technical Support and asked if the RX100M III had this essential feature (for my use as an event camera person). I was reassured that this feature was available and went forward with placing the order. When I received the camera, I quickly discovered that like in the RX10, still photos were not possible while shooting video, which was later confirmed by a different person at Sony Technical Support. As I stated in my review of the RX10, there are several cameras that I own (including the older HX9V and TX-10) that do offer this feature. Recently, I purchased the HDR-CX900 video camera, and low and behold, this feature was available! There is no logic as to why Sony chooses some of their models to have it and some not. Just be aware that the RX100M III does not have this feature if you are looking for it."],["I was looking for a solution for when a DSLR just isn't possible.  Example formal dinner in a suite and tie.  But I didn't want to settle and sacrifice image quality.  The RX100 iii has blown me away.  I am a skeptic by heart so when I heard about all the amazing things the RX100 iii could do I was doubtful but I wanted to give it a chance.  I am glad I did, not only is this little camera designed very well in my opinion the image quality is on par with my 7D.  I tested images using my favorite go to 17-55 f2.8 against what this tiny camera could do and it kept up if not in some instances beat it from a iso noise perspective.  Sony really out did themselves.  This will for sure go with me wherever I go.  You just never know when a moment will happen that you will want to capture.  If you are looking for something small with great image quality look no further."],["I bought the RX100 in its original configuration a few years ago when it first came out. I liked the camera from the outset and have taken more than a few pictures with it that I am really happy with. It is my choice for backing up my Nikon D4 or D800 when I can't deal with taking along two large DSLRs. I took a look at DXO mark and they rate the sensor the same as the sensor for my old D200 which may sound like damning with faint praise but the D200 was a workhorse and shot a lot of great stuff. I will say at the outset that I like the M3 a lot. I am happy I upgraded from the original but I think that if you have the M2 you may not need this update. The faster lens is a noticeable improvement. Indoor shots without flash at reasonable ISO's are much more feasible now.Updated 6/24/14 - I thought I would add a comment about a statement from the dpreview piece on the M3. Dpreview praises the cameras abilities and then go on to say that it is not \"fun\" to shoot with. I guess an old SX-70 may have been more fun with all the whirring and spitting of prints but beyond that I am at a loss. I have had great creative session with both the M1 and M3. In fact, one of my favorite things about the camera is that is so easy and transparent to handle.Pros:Articulating LCD - I think this is a huge improvement over the original RX100. The ability to easily shoot high or low angle pictures is a great advantage. I have always liked using compact cameras from the ant's eye view and this makes it a lot easier to do. Like most of the construction of the RX100m3, the articulating LCD feels well built but clearly this is not a ruggedized camera. Care must be taken with the flash, EVF and LCD or damage could result. Things don't feel cheap they just don't feel \"battle ready\"Picture Quality - I really like the output of the RX100M3. The pictures are sharp, vivid and relatively free of noise at moderate ISO settings. One of the big improvements in the area of low light is the enhanced widest aperture of the lens. One can pixel peep any lens into a corner (no pun intended) but Sony has done a very respectable job here. I will discuss this more later but by going with a fast, modest zoom with a nice wide end, Sony has created a more enthusiast oriented camera. As Robert Capa said, \"If your pictures aren't good enough, you're not close enough.\"Zoom - As mentioned above the zoom range is modest. I just really like the ability to use 24mm equivalent at the wide end. The zoom speed is quite good. Again, I think it compares favorably to other high-end compacts that I have used.EVF - When I opened the EVF for the first time and look through it was terrible. Then I adjusted the diopter and it was beautiful. Seriously beautiful. This is my first EVF and I like it very much. I can see using it a great deal with this camera.Shutter - The shutters drops very quickly without any undue lag. I really like the burst mode on this camera with the shutter sounds turned off. It is a great way to get very natural candids of friends and family.Neutrals:Weight - The RX100M3 is noticeably heavier than the original. Noticeably but not significantly heavier. Yes, when you pick it up you are just a touch more cognizant of gravities pull but nowhere near the point where you would leave on the table because it's too heavy to deal with. When carrying and using the camera the extra weight never crossed my mind.Size - Certainly related to weight but also a function of adding goodies like the EVF and articulating LCD. I wear a lot of clothes with big pockets and I have never been one to just stuff a compact camera in a pants pocket on an ongoing basis. I have a very small Lowepro belt case for my original RX100 and the new one fits perfectly even with an extra battery tucked inside. The size and weight differences are certainly discreet.Added 6/22/14 The current implementation of the Fn button is very nice. I really didn't use this button in the past but now it brings up a very clear, easy to follow UI for the some of the most commonly accessed functions. I really like this feature.Added 6/22/14 I am growing very fond of the artificial horizon in the EVF. Despite 30+ years of photography I am still amazed how often in Lightroom I have to straighten the horizon. Maybe my head is just tilted. Whatever the cause, the artificial horizon really helps and as a result I am not losing any of the frame having to rotate in post.Cons:Menus - While the menu system on the M3 is improved and certainly better than the old NEX software it could still use improvement. My biggest complaint has to do with navigating between menu categories and sub-menus. To me the UI manipulation is not intuitive but is certainly workable.Functions - Marketing people are wonderful and I know scene modes and scene recognition must be important to some segment of customers but I am not in that demographic. I suppose there is little harm in all the bells and whistles but it is very funny that Sony includes both an Automatic and Superior Automatic mode. When does one say, \"I don't want the superior results, let me kick this baby down to stinky normal Automatic mode.\"Items on which the jury is still out.Wi-fi - I know there are people who can't wait for the favorite camera to come out with built in wi-fi so it can't be dismissed. I would only say that thus far my experience with the RX100M3's wi-fi functions have been cursory and I will amend this review when I am able to be more definitive about my experience.Would I recommend this camera?For a lot of people yes I would. If you are an enthusiast this is a credible compact contender. If you are an ultralight traveller who likes good photos this is also a good choice. If you are thinking of some for an adventure vacation with water, snow, sand or surf, probably better to look at a ruggedized compact.

Older versions of PS won't open it. all in all a great camera.

It was the addition of the amazing EVF pop-up (looks exactly like my RX10 EVF), the bright 1.8-2.8 lens, the (finally!) cool &#34;we-fie&#34; flip-up LCD screen, a pop-up flash that can be flicked back for a good fill flash effect), and the inclusion of the more modern ALPHA operating system. Handheld twilight, Anti-motion blur, are all here. Quiet, quick, and efficient.OK, its all near perfection. All I can add is that It is a bit of a chunk, but solid. It will fit in pants pockets but you will know that its there. It is a bit heavy and slippery while trying to shoot with one hand (needs only a tiny grip). Use the wrist strap! It's the 1-inch sensor (like the RX10) so it has a ~2.5 crop factor, which limits the smooth bokeh you might expect. It cannot accept filters.Other than that, sell what you have a get this."]],"title":"Sony DSC-RX100M III Cyber-shot Digital Still Camera","total_reviews":53,"sentiment":0.8481113208,"label":"positive","best_review":["Everylasting good"]}]

They were impossible to find in normal brick & mortar stores, but of course Amazon had a selection.I measured a jewel case and these looked like they should fit (10.4mm) and they do fit a standard single CD jewel case perfectly.  They are top loaders meaning it's like putting something into an envelope for the US Mail, load from the top and flip down the flap.  They have something that looks like a strip of Scotch Tape on one side.  You peel that off to uncover the adhesive strip.  Then the flap sticks to the adhesive.I've only used one so far.  But with that single example, even though the fit is snug (which it should be or the extra material gets in the way and has to be taped down, etc.) the bag (pouch?  wrap?) did not tear or split open.  The adhesive seems to hold the flap down sufficiently.  Because I removed the peel off strip after I put the CD and cover in I didn't have to worry about the adhesive damaging the thing I was trying to protect when I put it in.  And the adhesive strip is thin and not real close to the opening so that probably isn't an issue either way (unlike using Scotch Tape or similar to hold the flap closed which can leave adhesive residue in places where it's easy to get stuck on things being put in).The package says quantity 100, I didn't bother counting them.  They come in a plastic bag that is slightly larger than the contents and it's about the same thickness as a jewel case so they don't take up much room.  When I bought them they were \"fulfilled by Amazon\" so I knew there would be no stock or delivery issues.  For $4.95 they seem like a good deal."],["Not a bad product in itself, but probably not for what you want. If your selling standard size jewel case CDs, and you need a plastic wrapper, this may be OK. If your looking for those thicker resealable plastic sleeves that sometimes come with Japanese style CD/SACD, and you thought you could use more of those for other SACDs in your collect, this is not those. Infact, these are super thin, and the sticky part is actually inside the sleeve, which means you have to &#34;tuck&#34; in the flap, and that sucks. In addition, they are not large enough for the larger MoFI, or Japanes import, these tend to be bigger than redbook/normal jewel case CD size cases.

I have found a few that are \"snug,\" but the protection against dirt/wear is the goal.  Here's a Hint: if you are going to be opening/closing the bags, to remove the CD for playing, don't use the resealable strip, as it isn't designed for repeated use.  Instead, use a small Post-It Note or Post-It Flag to \"tape\" the bag shut.  This system works nicely, until you're ready to seal the bag and file your CD away.

My friend and I had to get everything charged in that short time, and I wondered if we would have enough time or even enough outlets.

I am glad that I bought the battery that came with the car charger because I have used it on car trips at home.  Bringing the car charger to Kenya was a great idea, and my guide was happy to plug in the charger if I had needed to.  I took a lot of pictures, but what I loved most about the game drives was standing in the Land Rover as we explored the Mara with the wind in my hair and the fragrance of warm grass on the breeze.

Bamboo is really nice stuff and is showing up in a lot of products. Ok, out of box it is perfect which, being not very complicated is expected. That box. Interesting. Actually took a few brain cells to open it without wrecking the package should I need to return it. Packaging is a whole other discussion, but I'll say it is very slick--designed as a case with a handle like Apple and HP do. Of course, a bit wasteful ecologically with the plastic and all. Now let's try it. I set it on the desk and plugged in the power cord to the USB port on the Macbook and heard nothing. I lifted the computer and could not see the fan turning. But then, through the cooling slats that was problematic. And yet, I felt a breeze. Ahhh, so I put my hearing aids in. I still heard nothing. But there was that breeze. I got really close to the fans and yes, they were working fine. Just quiet. Great! I hope they stay that way. Now another reviewer complained that the fans did not blow, or draw, enough. I disagree. It really shouldn't  take much to improve on an already functioning internal fan, and if it supplements it to any degree, in addition to the physical enhancement of the slatted venting design, I say job done.All that said, barring the fact that the product is still new, I say kudos to a nice example of form and function.

My laptop never has to turn on its fans.What also makes this an absolute gem are the two (2) fans - they are QUIET, very quiet.  Can hardly hear them.  That's why this makes sense to use anywhere - even in libraries where noise is so not tolerated.So, buy it - the price here is better than the store or even eBay.Looks great, functions wonderfully and is just plaini simple to use.I highly recommend it.Good day,"],["This looks neat and the fans function properly, the only drawback (for me) is that it raises the height of my laptop, as I am now using a wireless keyboard that is not really a factor anymore..."],["I've been using the Ecofanpro for about two weeks, with a Dell Insprion 6000 laptop PC.  The Dell gets very hot, and the heat radiates through a lap desk.  The Ecofanpro keeps the Dell nice and cool -- it really works.  The Ecofanpro also looks good and seems to be built well.  I have used the Ecofanpro on a desktop and on a lap desk.  The mechanical design of the Ecofanpro has two problems for my use: (1) the front edge of the stand leaves laptop PC more than 1 inch off the desktop.  I would rather the design allow the front edge of the laptop PC to drop down to the desk surface.  This extra inch makes the keyboard too high for comfortable desktop use. (2) My laptop PC tends to slide off of the Ecofanpro when the Ecofanpro is adjusted to an angle other than flat.  This makes me worry that the PC may slide off onto the floor.In summary, it does a fine job of cooling, runs quietly, and looks good.  The mechanical design flaws are that front of the PC is raised too high off of the desk and there is no good retainer to keep the PC from sliding off."],["Purchased for a friend who uses his laptop in the evening while relaxing in his bed.  No overheating and better viewing angle have made the experience much better, he reports."],["I was looking for an adjustable-height cooling pad that I could use *on* *my* *lap* as opposed to on a desk. I write mostly with my laptop on my lap in a big, comfy chair. Unfortunately many of cooling stands I found require the unit be placed on a hard surface. This stand vents not only from the bottom, but also from the sides and back, so it'll cool the computer no matter where it sits.The reason I'm not rating it a five is that some higher-end cooling stands incorporate additional USB ports into the unit and this one doesn't. Since this unit runs on a USB and laptops generally have a limited number of ports, it's a disadvantage to lose a port for cooling. I solved the issue by finding a very slim USB hub with an ultra-short cord. The hub is perfectly sized to fit between the upper and lower decks of the unit, and is slim enough not to interfere with the unit when it's sitting flat. I used velcro to secure the hub to the underside of the upper deck, so it moves with the upper deck when I raise and lower the angle of the stand.I also used velcro to secure my laptop to the deck of the stand, because I don't generally move my laptop around much. Of course this won't work for everyone, but I found the top of the unit to be so smooth that my laptop slid around a bit.This cooling stand is just out of the box today, so the quality of the fans hasn't been an issue for me at the point. However, I did notice that the underside of the upperdeck where the fans are housed is accessible by removing four tiny screws. I can't imagine it would be too difficult to replace the fans if necessary.So far, I'm thrilled with how this stand came together, even if I had to jerry-rig a USB hub to accommodate my printer and external hard drive."],["I just got my stand today. I love it. Everything about it is awesome. I have a new Sony VAIO and it does not get hot. It has a fan on the side for cooling. I like the cooling fans because they keep the air circulating around the computer. I love that it has a USB plug for powering off the computer. I keep my computer plugged in so I do not know if having the USB plugged in runs the battery down."],["This cooler fan looks good and seems to work OK. However, the lip at the bottom that is supposed to hold the computer in place is too small (not very high). My small netbook just kept sliding off.  Not a good design!BUY SOMETHING ELSE!

Unfortunately, the stand is poorly constructed and breaks easily. Mine shortly after buying it and I haven't been able to fix it since. The back has popped off on one corner, making it uneven when trying to use as an actual stand. I can still use it as a fancy rest for my laptop and the fans still function, but it's pathetic that the construction is so poor."],["I received this cooler today so I cant give any long term reports. What I can tell you, right out of the box, it was evident that this stand was of nice quality. There is going to be no other purpose than to hold my laptop on my desk, no moving it around...just there. I have gotten rid of my desktop and am using a Dell 15.6\" computer as its replacement, I have it set to the highest setting and it puts my screen at a perfect height. It does have a lip on the front of it but my computer has is beveled on the front edge that could slide right over it but the feet on the computer and the surface of the cooler gives just enough resistance to sliding that I am not at all worried about it. I am using a separate mouse and keyboard so I don't have to touch the computer at all. I suppose if I were typing on the computer itself it might move around some that would dictate a lower setting on the height I am so pleased with this purchase and would highly recommend this product for someone who is looking for a well built, attract cooling stand for their deskThe fans are relatively quiet, not any louder than my desktop when it was in use and flows a good amount of air.

Because of this extra height the typing position for the laptop keyboard is not optimal (for me). That being said it's wood, so it's naturally a little clunkier. You give a little you get a little.The performance of the fans seems to be great so far, they're quiet, I've only had it a day so I can't comment on the durability of the fans but the stand itself feels more than solid enough to handle being used daily for years.Aside from the issues with typing position, the height of the monitor is perfect for me at it's highest angle. I'm using this stand with the Retina Macbook Pro and the two go well together. One thing about MacBooks is that they're so thin the monitor is practically starting at the level of your desk, this stand works very well to rectify that issue.Great product easily worth the money."],["I would have preferred a little more airflow but it still does the job. .Fingers crossed on fan runtime life and noise."],["Bought this for my wife for work.  She uses a MacBook Pro 15\" on it and the adjustable height is a good feature.  Have not tried the fan, as it requires USB and right now there is not an available one.It would be helpful to have had a built in USB hub."],["Just love it!. Dont use fans though because it eating battery life, but there is enough air flow without fans. Nice looks, easy lift."],["Holds the laptop at an ideal position so that working on and viewing the computer is comfortable.  Fans seem to do a good job.  So much more attractive than a plastic or metal stand.  No problem holding a 17\" laptop."],["I absolutely love this cooling stand.  The fan is unbelievably quiet and it is quite attractive.  I feel that this was a smart investment for my MacBook!!!"],["I wanted something nice and kinda mid-century modern for my laptop. I have a Macbook Pro 15\" and this fits my style perfectly and works fantastic. It's actually ventilated very well so I only use the fans when I am doing heavy work in Photoshop and Illustrator. Very nicely built."],["Bought this for my wife's HP DV4-1220 mini-toaster.  The fans are quiet but move enough air.  The desk itself is very nice, square, and smooth.  The fans are enclosed in a box, so it looks good.  The usb cable which powers the fans has plenty of length.  There is a strip across the front that keeps the computer from sliding off the stand."],["The look of this product is fantastic! Also, being that the other laptop-stands are usually made of a plastic-like material, one's laptop tends to slide right the heck off of those stands, which can be extremely frustrating to you and potentially damaging to your computer; the material, the bamboo, of this stand seems to make that less likely to happen. I'd star in the commercial advertising this product!"],["This laptop cooler is well crafted and nice to look at as well. I'm not a huge fan of plastic made junk so the other coolers out there didnt appeal to me. I have a 17.5\" HP that measures 14-7/8\" wide x 10\" deep and it fits on the cooler with NO room to spare and with nothing hanging over. The cooler measures 15\" wide x 10-1/4\" deep, now there's a strip of wood running across the front that measures 3/4\" deep. So with that strip in place (which prevents your laptop from sliding off while inclined) the actual flat surface is 9-1/2\" deep. So with that said, even though my laptop fits fine, that strip of wood should be made thinner by about 1/4\".As I write this review I have a friend on Skype, Facebook running, and a music program playing. My laptop is cool to the touch, where as prior to the cooler it felt like it was gonna start a fire. I've read all the other reviews, some made mention of the loud and/or fan failure. I keep mine plugged in at all times, it runs non-stop and it's very quiet. While my first thought was, there's no way that little amount of air will make any difference....I was proved wrong. It seems to deliver just enough air to the right spots to do its job.The construction is really the most impressive thing about this cooler. It's attractive!! There's really no other way to say it. They seem to really take pride in their product. Lets face it, anybody can mount fans under anything and it would do basically the same job. As proven by those plastic things out there that \"look\" cheap as well as being cheap. Why would anybody choose those over a handcrafted well thought out cooler such as this, is beyond me.Very recommended product for those that demand something better for their hard earned bucks!!As I write this review my cooler is 1-1/2 months old."],["This is a fantastic purchase.  Really works well for cooling, and also does a nice job with angling the laptop to where its most comfortable.  Beautifully constructed.  Eco friendly!  Really is just perfect.  I have had this now for 8 months, running an average of 13 hours a day, and its still performing beautifully.  Must be my 6th cooling fan I have purchased, but I do know it will be my last!"],["I love this bamboo laptop cooler. It has adjustable tilt and the fans are super quiet, you hardly notice that they are on. I would definately recommend this stand."],["Couple parts were loose and some of the bamboo pieces on the sides fell off during shipping (I assume). Had to glue back on, otherwise, it works well."],["The Macally ECOFANPRO is just the laptop stand I was looking for. Beautiful design, dual fans, adjustable height and come on, it's made out of bamboo. I regularly game on my 15\" MacBook Pro and you could fry an egg on it after a few minutes of the graphics card going to work. With this stand, my laptop has left the \"imminent danger\" zone and I feel much more secure playing games for extended periods of time. Even better than the cooling is the design aesthetic. It's elegant, yet sturdy and functional. I like wood-colored accents so this matched nicely with my wood & glass computer desk.As for the quality of the fans - a quick trip to the local computer store can nest you a couple of decent 2.5\" fans for probably $15. I'd rather do that than deal with an RMA process with Macally and end up with the same exact fans again. My fans are still going strong after several weeks of use but if they do go bad it's not exactly difficult to replace them. You're really paying for the craftsmanship of the bamboo anyways.Update 7/21/11: I ordered two more of these stands for coworkers and they are now shipping with updated fans. They are larger and have a better blade design, so they push considerably more air than the original fans, and are black as opposed to white. Only downside is they are a little bit louder than the old fans. I have a feeling they changed the fans as a response to end user disappointment over the original fans, so I expect these fans to last even longer and work more reliably. That said, my two original Ecofan stands with the white fans are still going strong with no issues."],["I am on my laptop all day and often work from my bed. This product has:1. relieved the strain on my wrists2. kept my lap from catching on fire3. kept my laptop from overheating.I love the sleek and simple design and the price is unbeatable.For anyone that uses their laptop for more than 5 minutes a day, this is a must have product!"],["I purchased the EcoFan Pro from a Brick and Mortar store.Pros:I was immediately taken with the sleek design and beautiful lines of the stand.  I like the color and I certainly appreciate being able to use the stand independent of running the fans.  I like that my MacBook Pro fits nicely on the stand and seems stable even when I transfer the unit from my lap to the coffee table.I am thrilled the company decided to make the USB power cord long enough to fit the last port on my laptop.  I have tried other coolers and was frustrated with the length of the cord and having to buy an extension to be able to plug the cord in one of the USB slots.The construction of stand is well-done and I have yet to see any loose hinges nor have I seen any any wooden parts that look like they are separating from the others.When the fans worked correctly, they were invaluable in helping lower the temp of the Macbook quickly.  I was a skeptic and assumed that the reviews were a bit overstated (about the effectiveness of the fans) but I'm convinced the claims of the cooling support was spot on.Complaints:The fans seem defective and make a ton of noise.  Originally I was able to blow off the dust on the fans (they seem to attract a ton of debris) and the fans would quiet down instantly.  This is no longer possible as it appears the fans are worn out as I assume the mechanisms in the fan have degraded. I've had this unit for six months and haven't been able to use the fans for three months as they are simply too loud.  I've thought about taking apart the unit but I am not sure that this will be helpful in solving my problem.I'll probably contact the company to see if the warranty will will respond to the noise problem, and if not I'll likely see if I can buy replacement parts.Three stars"],["Had the product for about a month and the fans were quiet at first but you can hear them hum now. I used this for my MacBook Pro but the fans are placed a little lower than where all of the heat is from so it doesn't seem to help too much but I think it's helping it a little. At least it takes the bottom of the laptop off and prevents too much of direct contact with your desk or lap to prevent it form getting hot too quick."],["This is the stand I've been looking for!  Beautiful materials, elegant design, solid construction, great attention to details, refined.  However, after two days the fans started sounding a distinct resonance pattern - this is the early sign of inevitable fan failure.  If only they had installed high quality fans, this would be a nearly perfect laptop stand.  As it is currently produced, it is unfortunately a critically flawed product that had to be returned . . . and returns are seriously, seriously annoying.Yet, I can't get over how nice this stand was.  So, I've ordered their other model in the hopes that it might, by some chance, have a reliable, quality fan set:Macally ECOFAN Bamboo Laptop Stand with Fan.  We'll see how this one does . . ."],["It is quite and sturdy. I really like the design and solid feel. The fans do a great job keeping my laptop cool and provides a great surface for me to work no matter where I am sitting."],["The well-made stand is everything it claimed, but it adds significantly to the total weight when I lift up my laptop and this together. The fan plugs into the laptop's USB port and runs continuously, even while the computer sleeps.  So to stop it, I have to unplug it.  The older MacBook that I bought this for greatly heated my leg while in use, but my new MacBook Pro with all flash memory usually feels cool to me, so I don't need the stand much."],["Yes, I agree with the other reviewer.  The fan on my stand broke after 1 year. I have been using it without the fan so it seems like a waste."],["The is a great book stand and works good for my laptop because the design allows air to circulate, however the fans only worked one or two times before they stopped.  Good idea but poor implementation."],["This is a great laptop stand, but as others have reported the fans are very cheap and will not last very long.  My fans started making rattling noise after 2 months of constant use.  I bought nicer fans and installed them.  Think of this is a project kit.  If you know how to solder and you don't mind adding your own fans, or if you don't need fans, or if you're fine replacing these every 2-3 months, then this is a great product!  The bambo feels like, and keeps my hot macbook pro propperly cooled."]],"title":"Macally ECOFANPRO Bamboo Laptop Stand with Fan","total_reviews":53,"sentiment":0.6768943396,"label":"positive","best_review":["I have so enjoyed this Bamboo Laptop Stand with fan, functions great and looks cool too!

However the quality of the protectors did surprise me. It went on super easily and i was able to remove all of the bubbles by pressing at them with my fingers. The applicator card is a little flimsy, but like I said, fingers/nails worked just fine. The protectors are absolutely clear and do not affect screen clarity/brightness or responsiveness what so ever. I could not be happier with it.The only negative that I found was the lint-free cloth. It feels a little cheap and didn't really clean my screen. I just used another cloth that I had on hand though, so it was no big deal. Overall, I would definitely recommend this product.

Some claim it can work but not, some can work but won't draw the attention at the title. This one falls to the latter. Let's first make one thing clear: size wise, all current existing Nex cameras, 3, 5, 5n, c3, 7, are all exactly the same. What makes 7 (and coming F3) a little bit special is that the top of the LCD is not the top of the body. So all the hard covers, which use both upper and lower border of the LCD to make the snapping, won't work on 7. Others will works perfectly fine if they fit on other Nex models.This screen protector has an almost-perfect sizing (I might be a little over judgy but it's about 1mm shorter than the entire LCD area). It has a matte surface so glare is totally out of question here. For a little over 1 dollar, you get 2 protectors with free shipping. I can't simply ask for more."],["Every owner of NEX should get some kind of screen protector for the LCD display to avoid unnecessary scratches and reduce the glare in bright day light.The small microfiber cleaning cloth included in the package made it easy to clean the screen before putting the protector on.

The first one is for trial.  Although, it's not hard to put on I used the yellow cloth (included) to clean my screen first.  Seems like I have yellow lint everywhere, unfortunately a lot under the protector.  And the bubbles are also little hard to smooth out.  If you purchase this go a clean area where nothing else is around.  Use a good lens cloth first and then start.  Work slowly at one end of the screen and smooth slowly as you go.  The second one looks much better."],["Can't believe that such a low-cost screen protector fits so well, and is so easy to put on.  Definitely recommend."],["After opening, the protective covering was encased in a plastic outer cover with two tabs that require you to peel apart.

Attaching the protector was easy and managed to get it on the camera on the first try. The protector has a slightly matt finish (which cuts down on reflections) and the touchscreen functions still work fine. The only issue (albeit a very minor one) is that the screen protector is about 2-3mm shorter than the screen in length.

I look at this strap across the cartridge as a positive feature: prevents possibility of losing the cartridge and keeps the tablet securely/snugly in the case.She uses the Leappad regularly and it has made it to bed more times than her dolls. That being said,  the case is still clean, no cracks,  no rips/tears.I have encouraged two others moms to get the Leappad and when I asked them to look for a case, immediately both responded: \"one just like yours\". (occurred at different times)At first I felt it would be nice if it came with a flap to cover the screen in transit. But it would have been unnecessary. I took off the screen protector as I installed it because it was decreasing the  responsiveness of the touchscreen. After almost a year of use, Leapfrog's sunken screen design and the extra cushion of this case has made that flap a moot point.

It is a thicker leather case and protects the leappad very well.

I saw two copies of this product. The first was dissapointing. BUT THIS ONE, is great. I have ordered it today so i cannot tell you much. It looks good, the graphix are clean (not blurry or smuged, looks HD-like) but it looks like the sleep/wake and volume buttons look a little hard to press, but you can see from the back there is a space cut out to prevent this. I also got a cool wallpaper for my lock screen and home screen (from google) to go with it. I think it will look cool when i play GTA on my iPod with it on. I reccomend this product to any one who wants their iPod to look awesome. ;)"],["Exactly what I expected. Has a soft feel to it. My son loved it, and for the price...it doesn't matter how long it last..."],["This case feels great and has an awesome look to it. Despite the tiny green ink dots on the back of the case, I would recommend this awesome case to anyone who wants their Ipod to look stylish.

Awesome!"],["My son actually picked this out and he is very happy with it.  It has really good sharp graphics, better than what the picture shows with more vibrant colors.  The color green doesn't show too well on the picture in the listing but the colors look much better in reality.  Personally I like the fact that it is a hard case but also has that slight plush rubber-ish feel to it in order to keep a good grip.  I feel it is well worth the price."],["This case is really cool and nice looking its soft and cheap of course really hella nice I'd say...........me gusta"],["The snap-on, hard case protects the iPod very well. The product was priced nicely and doesn't slip off the iPod like other silicone cases do.

I ordered it on Wednesday and it came on Saturday with 3-5 business days of shipping! Its sooo cute and fits my iPod touch just right!! The wings don't bother me one bit, they actually help me hold my iPod. There was NO stain on its belly when it came. I absolutely love this case, I want another one of these! The color is amazing too! The only complaint i have for this case is that, its covering the speaker, but the sound still comes out of the device just fine, not muted nor muffled. I really recommend this case!"],["Fits my ipod so perfectly and I got ALOT of compliments on it. He's (yes I call it a he) is absolutely adorable, fits perfectly, i love to hold onto the little wings out of boredom and no they don't get in my way while scrolling or typing or anything else on my ipod. I can't wait until I order it in more colors.!He does muffle the sound of the speakers so much that if I was showing someone a video and the tv was on and we were playing loud music you couldnt hear a thing and I had to keep taking him off my ipod but other than that you can still hear everything."],["This cover took a while to arrive but it is cute and my daughter loves showing off her iPod now."],["I bought this for my 8 year old and her ipod touch.  it was a great price and she loves it.  fits perfect."],["I LOOOVE.iT WAS FUN AND QUIRKY BUT IT MADE MY APPLE IPOD 4TH GEN.
