I dont have any bad things to say about this product."],["This toy is probably best for beginners who haven't established preferences in a vibe.On the plus side, the vibration can be turned up using the knob a little or alot instead of jumping from one speed to the next or anywhere in between. The size and contours provide a nice friction without being overwhelming; again, great for beginners. As well, its discreet appearance doesn't scream \"GIANT FLORESCENT VIBRATING COCK,\" which is nice if the vixen in you gets a wild hair and decides to use it on your husband or lover or intimately aquainted homophobe. Very cool too that the vibration isn't particularly loud; its quiet enough that you wouldn't be able to hear it from the other side of a closed door.A drawback of this item is that the plastic, while smooth, is hard. I've used vibes that are hard like a dolar store toy water gun,and this isn't scary hard plastic, its just HARD. As in NOT JELLY, and jelly vibes reign supreme in my playroom. Hard as in electic toothbrush? IDK. Another negative is that there is no curvature at the tip for g-spot stimulation, nor is it possible with this vibe to stimulate the clitoral area while achieving penetration simultaniously. And while we're talking penetration, you probably will wantto plan ahead and use lube, because again, we're talking HARD PLASTIC, but because it is relatively narrow and short, this vibe can be hard to contol once you get your groove on and it \"disappears.\" I'm just sayin.All in all, not really a bad vibe to have around or add to your collection."],["Was a great thing to have I love it a lot ....definitely something to get for all womanGreat good"],["It was uncomfortable to use because it was very straight/rigid.

That's about where my interest with this vibe ends though. It is hard plastic, which I don't mind, but the small bubble part on the top makes it somewhat uncomfortable for deep use. Also, it's quite buzzy. The vibrations are noisy and sort of.. fast but shallow.. if you know what I mean? It makes for less satisfying O's in my opinion.

Yes, it is hard plastic, but it is also smooth (no sharp seams, which you really have to watch out for in cheap sex toys) and it has worked just fine in water for me (but I don't submerge it in the bath or anything--it does screw tight at the base, and has a rubber o-ring to seal water away).

I thought at first that the hard plastic would be a problem (noise), but it's surprisingly quiet. It gets a little louder (like an electric toothbrush) on the higher levels, but nothing a little discretion can't handle.  It's seamless, and very easy to clean.  Being waterproof, you don't have to worry about the main elements getting wet.  There's a seal around the battery end that shuts out water when you put the batteries in.And POWERFUL!I can't handle the higher settings... ;) And I love the nubby bit.  The control is a twist knob at the battery end that is easy to adjust and play with.The only problem I can see is if you get more than a little \"enthusiastic\" with this, it might hurt.

And the packaging says by rotating the base you get 3 ascending speeds of vibration but I don't see how because turning it also unscrew it and makes it stop. So it has only THREE settings (one pattern, 3 speeds of vibration.The push button to change speeds is a pain, you have to press hard to make it effective and it stops until it gets to the new speed.

He's like, \"What the heck?!\" Anyway, the first time was akward for me and he said weird for him, but he liked it. He was also surprised I would buy something like this, but I told him I wanted to spice things up a bit for him, so he was fine with that.Now that I've used it on him several times he likes it a lot. I can tell! So, it's been a hit with him. Now, if I could just get him to buy me something fun! Which will NEVER happen unless I tell him exactly what I want and order it myself.

For someone using this as an anal toy, there is the temptation after relaxation to push the envelop and take it all in. And the dimple in the bottom tempts a partner's penis to follow after. But be aware of the danger envolved if it is completely insereted in the rectum such that the flat base is within the anus and above the sphinxter. The 8\" device just by body motion can easily travel up from the rectum to to colon and definite will if even an average-sized penis follows after it. Once beyond the tail bone, the device will become lodged, that is, TRAPPED by the tail bone because of toy's flat bottom. A thiner, more flexible round bottom toy would easily skirt the hook and pass down and out. But because of the flat bottom and this toy's thickness and relative stiffness, no amount of internal pushing nor relaxation nor the painful, ensuing colonic spasims will dislodge it from the hook of the tail bone. Only an activity partner with very long and agil fingers in a blind space, or plan two, smarking ER staff with appropriate instuments including whooping anal dialtors, lighted scope, salad-tong forcepts and hopefully appropriate experience will be able to easy it out without internal badily damage or surgery. You think in time that pressure form eveything coming down the pike from above will push it out?

Just the right mix between flexibility and firmness. The grooves are not only great for the sensation, but give you a solid grip. The strawberry candy scent is a bit overwhelming at first, and does NOT go away, not matter now many times you wash it.

If you're not bothered by the scent, it's a perfect toy for start off with if you're a beginner or trying to introduce toys to your wife/girlfriend/etc."],["This toy is an accurate 8.5\" in length and just under 6\" in circumference for just under 2\" diameter. If you aren't used to something this big, it could be intimidating. Being of average size and some experience, however, it isn't tremendously challenging to use. Don't get me wrong - it is plenty big. It is big enough that even though it has nothing in particular to hold, there is enough room to hold it during use. I can see how this width could be uncomfortable for some people, but for others would be quite pleasant. More than likely, you know where you stand.The firmness of this particular jelly is somewhat lacking for me. Obviously, it is not completely rigid, nor should it be. However, a jelly needs to be of sufficient firmness to be stimulating without using excessive force. I'm not sure this quite makes it, but if you're looking for something on the softer side, this is it.The smell of this jelly is... quite strong. Right out of the package it was a bit overwhelming. I expect odor from a jelly toy of any kind, but it seems the scent they used to cover it up (which, to me, rings of the cloyingly sweet artificial fruit smell of candy) is a bit overdone. Now that I've had it a while, the smell has calmed down, but it's still stronger scented than my other toys, so if you're very sensitive to that, take a pass on this one.It's not all bad, as this toy is a total bargain. It's easy to use (with a good lubricant), and it's a pleasant size, if on the large side.

Google phthalates, I had never heard of them before, but they are a type of chemicals used to soften certain rubbers and jellies.  They are also quite bad for you.  If you go to the more reputable adult toy makers sites, you will see all the better toys listed as phthalate-free.

My wife and I have been expanding our collection of toys and thought this would make a nice addition to our collection.For starters, the size on this item is perfect. Many of the other silicone dildos we have ordered and tested out arrived with very thick circumferences. My wife tried to use some of these dildos with thick circumferences and found it is both painful and impractical to use. This dildo, on the other hand, is neither too small nor too big but just right. She swears it is like a regular penis being in here.The dildo has a nice veiny texture to it providing a ridged feel in which she enjoys tremendously. Make sure you use a condom on your toys every time. Some people have reactions to the materials they use in these toys. Also, condoms make clean up tremendously easily later on as well as protect against the growth of bacteria and other harmful items.Yes, there is a smell. By now it is something we were expecting. So far every dildo we have ordered has had the same toxic industrial smell. The scent of these items is so bad that it can fill up an entire room with their smell. There is very little you can do. We found that soaking these dildos for a day in vinegar and baking soda, washing repeatedly, and leaving out does help to minimize the scent that emits from these items some. I emphasize SOME.

I've used previous toys before like thegrrl toyz Hydro Bunny Pearl Vibe Vibratorand the shaft was thick and filling. The girth of this toy is smaller, but it provides for very, very easy insertion and fantastic mobility within ;)- Speed: 10 speeds of shaft rotation (with multiple pulsation and escalation patterns)- Texture: the texture of the shaft is fantastic, smooth, and soft-sturdy. You won't have to worry about it be being too hard and unyielding. This vibrator's shaft will fit nicely and gently inside - no complaints!- Shape: the shaft is realistically shaped like a penis, so that is a bonus.- Pearls: the pearls are nonjamming so they keep rotating nicely and are positioned well right at the opening of the vaginal lips for extra stimulation.- Rotating head: Such easy insertion and breath-taking rotation of the head, likely to hit the G-spot.- Lubricant: If you wanted extra pleasure, add a water-based lubricant to rocket your orgasms skyward. I useAstroglide Personal Lubricant, Sensual Strawberry, 5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)and lube up the shaft with a few drops.- Smell: there is no distinct smell of the vibrator and since I use a strawberry scented lube, it makes the entire session smell great.Vibrator:- Shape: it is shaped like an elephant where the 'trunk' of the elephant serves as the clitoral stimulus. It is also tri-point so it can move with you.- Speeds: 3 clitoral vibration patterns (with multiple pulsation and escalation patterns)Limitations:- Size: I wish this toy would have been thicker and longer. Something about deep and full penetration is satiating when the vagina is able to squeeze the thickness upon climax.- Battery compartment: The batteries are placed in a strange arrangement. It's not hard to place correctly; it is just not convenient.- Not waterproof: this toy is not waterproof. The battery cover is rather loose so be careful to keep water away from the battery pack!Battery life and durability:Unknown! To be experimented with and will update later.Experience:AMAZING! It had me orgasming in minutes and left me smiling silly like never before. This vibrator has got me addicted. I used it for the first time last night and now it's got me hooked!

This toy is on the bigger side for the rabbit type toys, which is definitely a good thing.  Nice girth at the base, she loves the full feeling.  The beads rotate at the base, and the speed of rotation is controlable.The clit stimulator is the best part of the toy.  Most toys like this have the \"rabbit ears,\" double prong type tip.  This one has a single \"elephant trunk,\" and it is amazing.  The vibration of the toy causes the tip to undulate across the clit.  Another nice feature is that the rubber which attaches the clit stimulator is very flexible, allowing easy positioning.  It is so flexible that you can actually hold the vibrator against the clit, while still being able to thrust the shaft in and out.Controllable speed on the vibrator, as well as different modes.  For the most part, two modes get used: the constant, and the on/off throbbing mode.  The others are a little intense (they rev up VERY high).The best compliment for the toy?  When my fiance reaches for it after a long sex session, and has another 3 or 4 orgasms!  If you want to see your wife/fiance/girlfriend reach new heights of pleasure, get her this and be prepared to watch her come for hours on end.

It's really interesting playing with the settings on this, since each bullet has a separate control with 7 vibration/pulse settings. 2 of these things working on the prostrate is absolutely earth-shattering. The metal houseing of the bullets makes for quick and easy cleanup afterwards. I wanted to try one of these after a different toy I bought came with one, single, cordless bullet. It was great but being cordless made extraction difficult. Since this is corded, it has a few advantages: the single cordless bullet uses a watch-type battery, which tend to be expensive. This corded one uses 4 AAs, in the handset, making them quick to change out and cheaper. As for being corded, extraction is as simple as a light tug. If I had to make one negative remark about this, it's that the shape of the bullets makes them somewhat difficult to insert, especially when your hand and the bullet are lubed up. Okay, one other slight annoyance is, sometimes the bullets will shift and end up side by side (instead of one ahead of the other, which is my preference), and then the rattle against each other. By themselves, the vibration isn't all that loud but when they're rattling against each other - well, it's a bit more noticeable.Oh, I ended up buying this brand/type versus a few of the others due to the independant vibration controls per bullet (others have one control for both bullets or 2 on/offs but no function variations) and because of the metal casings. I think the metal is easier to clean up versus the rubber/plastic of some of the others.

There is no bushing, relieve or other kind of water tightening. The cable just goes loosely inside the egg's cavity. The space inside the egg between the cable and cavity walls is impossible to clean up and dry out. There will be inevitable accumulation of moisture and organic debris which provides growing medium for bacteria and mold. I am not going to use this product because it is not safe.

With the Turbo Bullet you can feel the different speeds because they are different in pulsing, with  the other bullets the speed goes faster.

It has a gradual taper both ways -- it widens and then slims down. Some only widen and remain that wide until the base. This one is more fun to me because of the way it's shaped. The head is also smooth and not overly pronounced, though some may say they prefer a rigid head.UR3 by Doc Johnson is also a safe material. Other copycat fleshy materials I have had reactions to, and thus I need to use condoms over those when I use them. That certainly adds extra costs and another step to the cleanup process, so it is much simpler to have a toy I can simply wash clean with one step.Another model of this toy is sold as a more dense plastic. This UR3 model is softer, and I would choose this one over the other any day. The silicone fleshy blend is safer also, than the other dense plastic one."],["Too soft, thick but very easily to be squeezed to 2/3 narrower.

I read all the reviews and looked at the dimensions and thought this would be on the larger end for me but that I could still handle it without a problem, boy was I wrong.

Just like everyone else said its much bigger then I had pictured.Even though the size was much bigger then I was anticipating its a gorgeous dildo.  When you look closely at it you can even see the blue veins.  When you put your hands on it you could easily think it is the real thing.  I love how the balls are even soft and are fun to play with.  It has a great shape that is perfect for hitting that &#34;spot&#34;.My intimidation faded quickly and was replaced by curiosity, I just had to try Jeff out.  If you are not use to anything this big (like myself) it will take some time, and lots of lube.  After two sessions with Jeff, and several orgasms later, I am in love.  I am very sore but I think with some use any one can get use to this fantastic dildo and enjoy it just like I did.  I also made use of the suction cup.  I found out quickly it sticks better to wet surfaces such as a shower wall, but it works well on dry surfaces too, it just might take a couple tries to get it properly stuck.I am so happy I made Jeff my first dildo ever."],["Wife loves it!!!! We were a little worried about the texture and size of this one but it's perfect, worth every penny. Comes in a nice storage pouch and with talcum powder.

I probably would like it just a little thicker but length is fine.  I just wish I could find one this size or larger with a vibrator.

I wish this was made to fit onto a Vac U Lock Suction cup base. The texture and stiffness feels great.

Nice full size to fill up everything but, soft and pliable enough to fit nicely when inserted. The UR3 material is very resilient and does not have the petroleum or pvc smell that some of the other realistic materials have. Easy to hold and work.

The shape is amazing as the thickest part is just past the head so it gradually works up to &#34;Oh My God Fat.&#34; The UR3 version is the ultimate out of the Doc Johnson dongs as it is really soft and flexible. Its worth paying the extra $ rather than going for the Realistic version which is stiffer and has a rougher texture. If you want a pounding like nothing else Jeff Stryker UR3 is the way to go. Can't use oil lubes though or it'll break down the material."],["product was delivered on time and was exactly as described,  it is really good for what it is but it is quite large in size - don't underestimate it haha.  i did"],["I must say ur3 material is the best hubby has bought me this and the John Holmes. This dildo has a nice size and feel but is to soft for me to use alone. I can not get it in, this is not due to the size but just to flimsy. It has a nice thickness to it at the head and gets slimmer at the bottom so once you push the head in the rest just gets sucked in. If you want big go for the John Holmes it is the best dildo ever, don't let the size scare you, just you plenty of lube and you will be having multiple orgasms in no time.

OMG I rode it up and down from the head to the balls and my knees were shaking! Needless to say My I am SORE in the best way! I will ride it again tonight. I love you Jeff!

Decided recently to order a new one, since the old one is showing some wear. I prayed that the quality would be the same as the last one, but as with most things these days, it had changed for the worse.  You see in picture how the thing stands up when it is fixed to the floor? Thats what my old one does. Nice and firm and pointing generally upwards. The new one flops down in an arc that points to the floor.  The reason must be that they used to build the thing around some sort of stiff frame. When I squeeze the old one I can actually feel the hardness under the soft ur3 material. With the new one there is none of that solidness underneath, just the soft stuff.  Im sure this thing is still of use, and everyone seems to love it judging from the reviews, but they dont know how much better the older model was: a perfect balance of hard and soft.  I hate to be a buzzkill, but I thought people needed to know.  Maybe you can still get one like the used to be, but I didnt. Thank god my old \"Jeff\" still has some life left in him. Basically its the suction cup that starting to go, which I will miss when it does, but after all, its not the most important thing.  Good luck."],["Product was delivered 3 days earlier then forecasted and product was exceptional, very good product and recommend it for people who don't like that harsh rubber smell hat on their similar products do ."],["I echo other reviews in that I'm a straight male that likes anal stimulation. My previous favorite toy was a Doc Johnson ultra realistic 2\" by 8\" dong, which I could take fully and satisfyingly. I was getting what I wanted out of my current toy but was curious about going larger, and also a bit afraid...sometimes big is just too big.  I ordered Jeff along with Rebelious Ryan, and when they arrived, I lined them and my favorite up along the shower tile. Make no mistake, Jeff is big! Ryan was slightly larger than my favorite. I started with the 'small' one and went to Ryan, then Jeff, and I felt my limits being tested, but in a surprizingly good way. Still, I could only get a little over half of him in at first.The next day, I tried, and went a little further and longer, and by day 3, I stuck Jeff to the top of my tub, and sat down and took the entire thing! It was incredible, and I rode him until my legs were shaking. A few hours later, I was back at it for a solid hour, and at the end, I exchanged him for Ryan and finished that way.The firmness, length and texture seem perfect. He is pretty thick, better than my 2\" dong. The curve is a little funny, but you can work with it. Not for beginners, but if you're experienced and looking for bigger, this is the way to do it."],["Woman's Point of View:What to say about this product? WOW! I love how this fills me up! When my husband asks me if I want to get stretched I immediately get turned on. I definitely need to be prepped in order to take the Stryker but once I am dripping wet, my husband gently pushes this inside me all the way to the balls. I enjoy the feeling this being thrusted inside of me repeatedly.  All I can say is I can't think of anything else except what is happening to me at that moment.To those of you who say they can't take this, you have to build up to it.  This takes  perseverance!  It also helps if your man knows what he is doing. They have to work you up (sopping wet does help!) and prepare you, no grand slams please!I absolutely recommend this product to anyone. It is a steal at this price as well."],["This UR3 cock is as big as you can imagine. Its thicker at the head (about 2.5&#34;) and gets thinner at the base (about 2&#34;) but not to thin.

We highly recommend this toy if I had to have only one this would be the one I would keep for sure fantastic! !"],["Ok this thing is large! I swear, guys lie more about there size than I thought. I have handled a few that were told it was close to the size of Stryker....but no way! I was a little nervousness when I first opened the box but couldn't wait to give it a shot. I had been playing around with a smaller one lately that was insertable 6\"x1.75\", this helped get ready but was a giant step up to the Stryker which I measured at 8\" insertable and a max of 2.4\" diamiter. Once I was warmed and lubed up I got over top of it and tried to see what I could take. It took me a few minutes to get the head in, I had to keep moving it around then try again. Once it went in it was a little painful at first cause it quickly widen to it max, so I had to take it slow, relax, then try it again and got a little farther each time. Finally I got to the point where it was stretching me the most, this is about 3.5\" down the shaft. Once you get to that point it begins to taper back down to about 2.1\", so when your ready push past the first 3.5\" and it will literally take itself the rest of the way. Oh my gosh!!!! I have never been filled up like that before!!!! It was pure amazing, although I was not able to take it all the way to the balls I was close and I can't wait to give it another shot and ride it balls deep till I can't take anymore.The material is amazing, super life like and feels great in your hand/mouth/body. Yes there was a little wierd smell but not that bad after you wash it. It was a little floppy and had to use both hands to get it started but what do you expect with the size and weight of that thing, once you got it started it was perfect, it is flexible enough to be able to move around to different positions but firm enough to where you use you hand to hold on the something while you ride the hell out of it or to have fun with other areas of your body."],["I needed a gift for a friend before leaving for overseas.I received the product and it was nicely packed.I tried to stick base on the wall but it did not have any grasp.

Just to give you some perspective on this dildo, the average adult man is 5.5 inches in length and 4.5 in circumference. This toy is 42% more in length and and 40% more in girth than most men. From some of the information I've come across, on average, the few actual men who are this size make up 1 for every 80 million men in the world. It really is that rare.You have to experience it to believe it. It feels so real and it's huge. This is as close to perfect as one can get. If foreskin were attached it would be perfect.Multiple and intense orgasms guaranteed."],["I have never experienced as much pleasure from any other realistic cock I have tried. I have tried cyberskin and sex flesh but both of these will burn your skin inside, plus they scratch really easy, and tear. UR3 has the best feel of any material I have ever used.

Once you get it that far in the magic starts.Make sure you and it are lubed up very well because it gets really wide really quick once you get past the head so go slow butt, by the time you get 3 1/2 inches or so down the shaft it will have you stretched and aching but just past that point what ever orifice you have it it will be begging for relief and because it quickly start tapering back down your body will essentially suck it into all the way to the balls very quickly then you notice the length when it fills you up.This particular model does not fit in a harness well if I had to do it again I would get the vac-u-lok Stryker I do hear after some vigorous riding the suction cup has a tendency to tear away.Instructions are included as to how to reattach the suction cup so this must be a common problem .As far as feel it feels like a real cock in the dark if this toy is warm it would be a tough call if you had a real cock in your hand or not.The main thing to remember is go slow use a smaller toy and work your way up because you don't want to hurt yourself be sore for three days or just say \"That so huge it makes me sore I hate it \" then throw it in a sock drawer and forget about it.You gotta take a shot and I believe it is worth the work.You are welcome to look and my toy purchases on Amazon for a reference to the sizes these work very well as step ups to the Stryker.Any question just leave me a comment here.Good Luck, Be safe"],["at last the soft realistic feel of UR3 in a larger size.my only complaint is that they did not make it vac-u-loc compatible. over all a very good product therefore the 5 stars."],["Look at reviews prior to this one as many people have already documented the size.

Anyhow, I decided to give this a try. Item shipped here fast, roughly 2 weeks for FPO address. Amazon refund shipping cost which was nice. When I opened the box and removed the package, I was a bit shocked. It look a lot bigger than in pictures. I thought no way I could handle it. But its very easy, super flexibility which I like. Did I mention very comfortable? Now the small one is pointless, I don't feel a thing. It's the size of my finger. I used it though just to try it out. I quickly moved to the middle one. I also find that the smallest one take a bit of effort to start because it's so small, hard to control and how flexible it is. The middle one is my favorite. I'm able to wear it all day. I wear it to the store, to work, etc. The height is perfect. That I can sit on a chair and it does not bother me. I wear the middle one with a thong to sleep all night. It's suction cup underneath on all 3 and it's good for bathtub play. I do it in my shower. Speaking of height, the large one could be a bit shorter. I can't seem to push the whole thing inside of me. The thickness, however, is nice. Does take more lubrication to work it. And about an inch or so stick out. I would give this a 5 starts but the base (or bottom)  could be a bit smaller. Its big and thick that it's somewhat uncomfortable while walking. Or any kind of movement really. Overall, I like it. Quality pieces, able to get the job done. Buy it. Whether you are guy or a girl."],["Small is too small.  Medeum is bit small.  Large is way too large.  I read the same opinion and I should have taken her more seriously before purchasing.

I use tight panties to help with that now.The large one is more than enough in length, though I think the girth leaves something to be desired. Also we have found that it too can fly out on occasion, though it is rarer, because the widest part isn't wide enough. I think it has a very long stem, so it has more wiggle room for in-n-out play.  It is comfortable enough to wear for some time, though if it was a tad bit shorter, it probably would be better for sitting down.They are very easy to clean and while they have a smell, it is not offensive or overpowering like some toys made of inferior materials.

I accidentally scratched it while measuring it and you can see a fine line across the material now, nothing horrible but indicates that it is a very sensitive material.--The pink color from the tip rubs right off when you wash it initially. Which in my opinion is kind of gross, because if you dont clean it well its going to rub off in a different location. So just be sure to wash/scrub it 3-4 times with warm water and dishsoap and you should be all set.-- Appears to be very \"normal/standard sized\" aka most likely won't scare your partner-- Suction cup appears to work very well on smooth surfaces-- Suction Cup slides around if you put too much water under it to moisten the suction."],["As a transguy it's important to me to have a realistic looking and feeling toy. When first taken out of the package you can see perfectly detailed veins and wrinkles. The head is a little too pink. However, both the veins and the pink on the head fade after use, especially if you put a condom on the toy- which i would recommend because it isn't pure silicone and it makes clean up much easier. The feel is Ridiculously real, especially when wet. The girth is pretty wide, however it will fit in a 1.5 inch strap on O-ring. It isn't completely rock hard, which i like because it's more realistic. Also, other reviewers mention the smell... it's really not that bad. It's not gross smelling, it's just like baby powder kind of. It will stay on your hands or anything else that it comes in contact with- BUT it will come off easily if you wash them or take a shower.In conclusion great product for a reasonable price!

The guy at my apartment office asked me if I got books, because there is no indication on the label as to where it comes from. I appreciate that!As I'm opening this package, the packaging itself is beautiful. Bright colors and the toy comes with its own travel carrying case! The feel of the toy is extremely realistic and soft. It's firm and long enough to pleasure you, but really feels like the real thing. The only negative is a slight smell of powder, but nothing a rinse off couldn't fix. I've never been happier with an amazon purchase.

Sometimes water-based lubricants just don't cut it; they dry up too quickly. Then there are the silicone-based lubes like gun oil that are too runny and messy. I found a product at Target called Love Garden, but it looks like they discontinued it. It's dimethicone-based, and was just fantastic! Through some research, I found that the Target brand was being produced by Doc Johnson. And I found essentially the same product under the Doc Johnson label. So, now, I'm a happy camper that my favorite lube is still available. It works like a charm. *loves it*"],["As others have noted, this isn't absolutely totally the best lube out there on the market, and the screw top still sucks. Definitely invest in a more user-friendly container. But it works well enough for all typical situations, and it is not oil-based, which is convenient. Scents make me feel ill, and this has none at all, a welcome relief. But most importantly, I have yet to come across a better deal anywhere, from any company, in terms of ounces per dollar. Heck, it would still be a decent deal even with only one bottle per shipment. For my needs, that alone makes this a great buy."],["Well, there aren't a whole bunch of features, bells, or whistles about this product that I need to cover... so let me get down to the, uh, meat and potatoes of this review.It just so happens that I'm a connoisseur of personal lubricants.  I see new brands, I buy them, and then of course I have to try them.  Some are better than others... some are not better than any.  The former are purchased again and again, the later are quickly discarded after making note never to make that mistake again.I am happy to report that this was not the first time I purchased this particular lube.  In fact, unless Doc Johnson, stops making this slippery stuff, I'll probably be a lifelong customer.  And here's why:- Doc Johnson's is incredibly slippery;- It lasts a long time;- It never gets sticky; and- Compared to its similarly formulated competitors (Eros, Gun Oil, etc.) it is a bargain.This particular lube comes in two flavors as well as the unscented/unflavored variety.  During the activities for which this particular product is best suited, I prefer things to be scented au natural in lieu of cherry or cotton candy, or something equally grotesque.  Hence, my experience is limited to the unscented variety of this product.There is, however, one minor annoyance I must mention. I don't know WHO designs these bottles... but whoever it is, CLEARLY never gets the opportunity to use this product for its intended purpose.  I've already extolled the virtues of this product.  Now imagine slippery hands trying to hold onto a tiny metallic screw-off cap.  Better still; imagine trying to unscrew this cap with slippery hands after tightening it quite thoroughly.  Is this flaw something to keep you from buying this product?  I surely hope not.  But I do hope that Doc Johnson reads this and assigns a few demerits to the bottle cap designer boy... because he is clearly slipping!The bottom line is that this is a top-of-the-line product at a very good price point."],["The lube works great. I have no problem washing it off, and it isn't overly greasy. The lube bottle could definitely use a flip-top lid or something more easily manageable.

If you like a non sticky lube this is one to use. It does not leave a sticky residue and for either vaginal or anal sex it works great.

I will agree the top could use revamping, because I too lose it often."],["As most other reviews point out, this is an excellent, non-water-based product, at a great price point for such.

Try this and the only reason ever to go with anything else (or using this product from its own container) would be to carry a smaller, travel appropriate container."],["I would only recommend this if you already had a suitable refillable device (which we have found to be a challenge) for actually applying the stuff.

The bullet is so powerful its hard to hold on to when you crank up the power but who's complaining? Both have a nice soft texture that slides gently across delicate skin.

The 3rd toy is not very useful to me....it has a cap with hard plastic protrusions that are way to &#34;pokey&#34; for pleasure but it comes off so you can use just the 3 vibrating smooth nubs underneath. This one has to be used straight on...not at an angle in order to feel the vibration. Not a good design. If it came with a smooth rounded cover with the same soft texture it would be so much better.

This is the best bullet that I have EVER used, and I have tried several types.  First off, it's coated with special rubber, which is smooth and velvety to the touch.  Straight plastic feels unpleasant sometimes, and this coating takes away that unpleasantness.  The buttons for the three different speeds are easy to manipulate *the 2nd and 3rd speeds are amazing.*  And, most importantly, this bullet is the perfect speed for my needs.  I've used several that are simply \"too fast\" or \"too powerful,\"  which eventually leads to pain, numbness and frustration.  I am happy to say that I experienced nothing but pleasure with this item, and I recommend it over other \"Dr recommended\" brands.  It is also the most quiet toy I have used yet!  Bonus!The only downside to the bullet is that you need to handle the cord with care.  After much use and abuse (a whole year's worth), the cord eventually severed near the egg part..which is normal for all bullets over time.The vibrator in this kit isn't the most powerful thing I have used, but It gently gets the job done.  It is also covered with the same pleasant material, which also aids in overall grip.  The dial at the end is easy to turn during use.The Pocket Rocket works for both clitoral stimulation and sore muscles.  I prefer to use it as a neck/back massager.  The clear plastic cap is covered with raised bumps, and it is easily removed.  The surface underneath this cap is basically a steel ball bearing, which feels cool and smooth to the touch.The Tuberose Lube smells, tastes and works great!I never regretted this purchase for an instant, and I plan on putting it on my Christmas list this year.For under 30 dollars, this is a bargain!"],["I like the egg the most but the rest of the kit is sort of boring.

The price was great for three non intimidating looking toys, and the company is supposed to be really good.(NOTE: I did not use the massage oil since I'm totally single, so I won't discuss it in my review.)Everything is pretty. Even the package was pretty. Even when I placed the toys in their own little ziploc baggies I kept the baggies in the original packaging until it fell apart from heavy travel use. So packaging is A+ in my book.The box states that the toys will feel like velvet due to a special finish. Getting the toys out of the package, they are very soft to the touch. It feels so good both to the touch and down there. Battery requirements are also easy to meet for most people with a stash of AA batteries in their drawers.The bullet is the most powerful toy in the package. Some of my most powerful orgasms ever have come from using this toy and the vibrator together. It has four settings and the fourth one packs quite a punch. It's the loudest toy in the kit, but it's still far from as loud as a jackhammer. This alone makes the kit worth the money.The pocket rocket and the vibrator are also good for the beginning sex toy user. They won't rock an experienced person's world, but they are excellent user friendly toys for beginners. When used with the bullet they can produce intense orgasms.Overall, I highly recommend this kit for beginners. This many good quality toys for such a low price equals a tremendous value.

Even now it takes a little practice to work this in my tight hole, but it is definitely worth it.

The UR3 material really warmed up quickly, unlike those rubber versions we have used before.  We knew it would take time to really loosen up,and after about 45 minutes it was time to really see what the feeling was like.  Plenty of lube and watching video's really helps.

And he actually feels really natural!He is big to get used to, but the width becomes easier with some lube and the head is pretty easy to get started with.  Since he feels real and warms quickly, I get wet really fast when I play with him.  The suction cup base works great in the shower - and combing him with the shower head aimed just right is really nice.  I've had mine for a couple of months, and the only complaint is that he has to be powdered after you wash him and he has a baby powder scent.

Heat it up in hot water and you can slip it in and pound away as long as your partner is used to size anyways lol. If not get the smaller UR3 items from doc johnson brands."],["I've been looking around for a new toy since recently ordering the Doc's Kevin Dean realistic. For those that have used UR3 materials before, you know it's incredibly skin-like. If you haven't, I suggest it. This particular toy (I'm not sure of all of the UR3 toys) is made using TPE, which is actually a rather safe material as sex toy materials go. I've seen it rated a 7-8/10 on safety scales, and it doesn't have the unpleasant odor associated with PVC and many other rubbers.This toy warms quickly (through use or exposure to warm water), at which point it feels even more realistical. The suction cup performs well, or at least for everything I've used it for. Also, while the toy is indeed &#34;squishy&#34;, it's not quite as squishy all the way through. I personally have no problem with the squishy texture because of the length and girth. It'll be a godsend for deep play, but as some reviews obviously state, the soft outer feel isn't for everyone. I would describe it as not being hard, but still firm enough to use, while still yet being capable of conforming to the body's curves. By far the best purchase of the sort I have ever made, and I would happily buy again or suggest to others.Two things worth noting though.-The blush color on the head of mine seems to have either already been slightly worn off, or wore off as I was washing it. This doesn't bother me, as it doesn't seem to affect the toy's performance at all, but some may be bothered about it.-This is NOT a beginner toy. I've used comparable toys, only slightly thinner with comparable length, as well as thicker, but shorter. This toy was a bit of a challenge for me, and seldom do I have to spend more than just a few seconds &#34;warming up&#34;. I haven't managed the entire length yet, but wasn't necessarily trying for it. Based on how easily the material seems to conform (particularly the outer layer), I don't foresee it being an issue to take, assuming you're capable of girth even remotely close, it'll just take a lot of lube and patience.Final point, again, I recommend this toy 100%."],["We bought this to expand our collection of large dildos as on ocassion the wife enjoys the feeling of being stuffed. We typically use the Jeff Stryker UR3 and the Lex Steel realistic. John makes these look like kids. I thought for sure my wife would not even try it. So I decided to use it on her without showing it to her first. After warming up with the Jeff Stryker and lex steel she ask to try John. With alot of lube and some clitoral stimulation he went in and she loved it. She was sore the next day but wanted to use him again a few days later.

But (butt?) for those who have advanced beyond the \"normal\" this is a challenge that is truly rewarding when mastered. The material makes all the difference in making this product comfortable and .. yes.. FUN! It has a very natural feel and just enough \"give\" to make it easier to accommodate and manipulate. A good (preferably water-based) lubricant is very helpful and both Astroglide and ID Glide work well, and are easy to clean up afterwards.One drawback seems to be that condoms react with the material after a while and tend to break (rip) fairly quickly. This is true of not only regular size (Trojan Enz), but even Trojan MagnumXL, so that stretching to handle the girth and length of this monster doesn't seem to be the problem. While I prefer using condoms on toys, this one gets used without one due to this issue.Think I'll pass on the opportunity to \"Make it fun!\" by submitting a video review LOL."],["I bought this dildo maybe 2 years ago, recently had to replace due to the suction cup breaking.  This was after many, many, furious poundings.  This new one is beautiful.  It is sculpted perfectly compared to my last one.It arrived in a semi non-discreet bag, in box.  Generally private packaging.  This one actually came in the retail box, whereas my last one came in bubble wrap in a bag, in a box, with all the extra stuff on the side.  You get some corn starch for preservation, a storage bag, and a little info booklet.  Out of the package, the head is very pink.  This dulls down to a more natural color and appearance after 2-3 uses/washings.Performance is almost unexplainable.  It is very large.  The first 5-6 inches are more than enough, but then as you loosen up, suddenly there are 6 more inches to play with.  I have never been privy to a cock this large, but I could imagine it would feel almost exactly like this.  The firmness:softness ratio is perfect.  It gives and bends, and squeezes and contracts right alongside you.  And the material warms up quickly providing even more realism.  The suction cup is probably the most powerful of any I have seen or used.  This is just simply the best affordable XL dildo there is.  Hands down.Large is an understatement.  You will gasp.  You will pull your own hair once it is inside you.  Again, just beyond words.  I try to use him infrequently as to not get spoiled by his sheer power and might.Simply put...You will not regret buying this if you are into large, XL, big dicks/dildos.

It's 12 1/2 inches long I didn't measure the diameter but just put it this way you probably wont be able to put your hands around it and have your fingers touch. Besides the size the Ur3 skin is insanely amazing it is crazy life like in touch and even in looks.The suction cup holds on surprisingly  Another plus about this product has to be the odor and by that I mean that there is barely if any odor from this thing. I bought this for my lady and she was very skeptical about the size but she was able to get it in with some lubrication and then the fun began.

We abbreviated foreplay because i just couldn't wait to try it on my lady. I used a liberal amount of lube and used a gentle approach while keeping her clitty cat occupied with my tongue. She was in discomfort and after trying a few more additional angles, still no luck. She said it was like trying to fit the big toe in one of your nostrils. Lol. I wasnt going to give up after spending 90 dollars on this thing. Less than a month later we decided to do this again. This time we had a few more than a few glasses of wine and she dressed in her full body fishnets. Our favorite is 69. So we started out like that and used our 6\" doc johnson while Holmes was under my leg warming up. I'm very attentive and can tell when shes getting closure to climax. At this time i made a smooth transition and used the back of my throat \"skittle\" spit haha. While shes still rocking back and fourth on my face i slipped it in and went with relative ease followed by a loud grunt of pleasure. I stayed with a slow rythmic just to make sure she was comfortable then speeding up to the speed we use with the 6\" one. Awesome, I thought!!! And to my surprise while this monster is sliding half way win \"no lie\" she requests for harder and faster.  15 seconds later I witnessed a screaming involuntary full body muscle spasm with my head trapped in btween her legs that lasted for about 25 seconds.  I had no IDEA what was going on (well i knew what was hapoening) but in the 5 years of being together and playing with various toys during sex I HAVE NEVER IN MY RIGHT MIND Thought such an orgasm ever existed and Big Johnny Holmes helped me supply that new transendental height of orgasm to my babe.Be patient with this toy if it doesnt work right away.

The vibrator is designed with the vibrating module positioned midway inside the shaft instead of closer to the tip and, since it's made of a soft material which absorbs vibration, there is very little vibration felt from the first two inches of it which is bad since the first two inches are important for clitoral stimulation. As others reported the small and medium plugs have little effect and the large plug is enormous.

I have added a few little extras like aInvincible Marine Folding Drink Holder (Black), aNOVA Hanging Walker Pouch, Blackthat hangs on the backrest, and just recently added thePortable Airplane Travel Footrest(all of which you can buy here). The one down side that I have found is the darn wire basket. It holds stuff, as long as it isn't small enough to fall through the holes, but while transporting, it is just cumbersome to have to take it out and store it separate. That is why I added the added the hanging leather pouch on the front, it can also hang under the seat out of the way and a little more secure in crowds.When traveling you do have to make sure the wheels are lined up just right so it will go as flat as possible, and in a small space, you can quickly remove the backrest and loosen the knobs holding the hand-grips so the can be turned facing each other. Then it can be stored just about anywhere. We have actually purchased a bike tote for the back of the car when my daughter and I are traveling together with both rollators. The bike tote works very well for transport.I even take my rollator on cruises.

I found another on-line reference that said that it was 26\" wide, but that's not correct.  Very, very annoying.I plan to modify it to reverse the rear wheels, which will reduce legroom, but will narrow it up by a couple of inches.  It's that or send it back.  If I needed it long term, I would return it, but since it only has to be used for a couple of knee replacements, I can likely make it work for me.In looking through the various rollators on Amazon, I was amazed as to how few had accurate dimensions.

I covered the inside with cardboard to fix this. 2- Marginal assembly directions-  or is it marginal assembly??

I keep the Medline loaded in the car and use it exclusively in town for shopping trips, outings, and excursions. It also is part of my evacuation and disaster preparedness gear so it stays loaded in the SUV along with my readiness Car Kit. As part of my disaster gear I wanted a rollator that could handle me sitting, along with having some of my evacuation gear in a backpack attached to the back support bar. This unit fulfills that requirement very well.I did replace the wire basket that came with the Medline with a cloth 'basket' that snaps in. I prefer the cloth basket for ease of loading into the SUV. I don't know why Medline doesn't offer that as an option. Otherwise, the Medline Barriatric rollator is sturdy, able to carry substantial weight, and fits well in back of the SUV.Actually for walking I like this Medline rollator because it IS wider, and there is more foot-space between the wheels.

Another advantage is the wheels are larger and manage rough ground a lot better.  All in all, after five months of hard use, it's as sound as it was when we received it.  As a short person, the only thing I would like to see is a Rollator with a seat that's closer to the ground or adjustable.  I understand making it adjustable also makes another stress point, but for a short person, sitting up a little too high is hard on the back of my thighs, which stresses my knees, and bad knees is why I bought it.

I wrote to the manufacturer and they were very good and sent me out a brand new rollator.  However, I'm having problems with the wheels again; not just the front ones (not wobbling as bad as the other one), but the back wheel is turned out and it feels like the brake is on, making it hard to push.

And the included splashguard is also helpful.I gave it only 3 stars because, when the seat is clipped onto the back of the unit, the clips make the seat somewhat higher in the rear than in the front, unlike other commodes I've tried, which are more level.  The result is that you slide uncomfortably forward.  You don't feel that you're sitting completely on it--and I am a pretty average, petite woman  (5'2&#34; and 128 pounds).  A solution is to clip the seat on backwards, so that the clips are in the front, raising the front of the seat so you don't feel like you're slipping off.

Since the description only mentioned Lavender, Chamomile, Patchouli, Grape Seed, Apricot, and Almond Oils, we both mistakenly assumed that the overall scent of the mixture would be primarily composed of those particular oils; as it turned out, however, all of those scents were completely drowned out by the pine scent.I will attest that this massage oil is perfectly reasonable by all other measures, however: it was thick enough to handle while still providing adequate lubrication, and the rate of absorption was neither too fast for massaging nor too slow to leave on afterwards."],["I thinking that it would just be your average oil but its defiantly. if you are looking to relax or to set the mood for a romantic evening.

I make my own laundry detergent and every other cleaner you can think of. A favorite of mine, and one I am most addicted to, is what I refer to as my &#34;everything spray&#34;. It is very simple to make. I use 1 part bottom shelf vodka to 2-3 parts distilled or RO water in a spray bottle (ex: 1 cup vodka, 2-3 cups water), then use essential oils to scent it. I have used many combinations such as cinnamon, orange, and clove for the bathroom, a mix of lavender, eucalyptus, and orange for my living room and so on and so forth. I have bottles of spray in each bathroom, in the kitchen, and in strategic places for use in every room. I use it to refresh clothing, furniture, wipe down counters. I spray the curtains for freshness. I use it to wipe down my coffee tables. In the bathroom it makes a nice freshener and daily shower spray. It even polishes chrome fixtures up so nicely. If I am expecting visitors, everything gets a quick spray down and my house always smells fresh and clean even if I slack off on the actual cleaning a little bit. Anyway, right now I am really stuck on lemon and orange scents. It is spring and it smells so fresh. I decided to add grapefruit to the mix and it smells so amazing! I also use Kirk's Castille soap bars to make my own counter top cleaner/floor cleaner for those tougher jobs. I scented it with, you guessed it, this yummy grapefruit scent.I can't say enough good things about Now Essential Oils. I have the lavender, clove, rosemary, eucalyptus, lemon, orange, grapefruit, and some others. They are all fantastic and all get used regularly. When my son gets headaches, I have him smell eucalyptus oil. Most of the time his headaches go away. I use the rosemary oil in my shampoo. The lemon smells great and is also tasty in a glass of water when I add a couple drops. I use the lavender on a cloth I throw in my dryer in lieu of dryer sheets. The towels smell awesome.

In a way, I feel like I'm a prime candidate for this type of supplement.The nutritional profile of this supplement is excellent, though I have to admit it is a challenge for me to get down.  It has a very grassy, organic taste, with a moderately thick texture when mixed.  There are also some particles which settle to the bottom of the glass after mixing.  These aren't clumps of powder, but thick particles or seeds which were not completely ground down (either incidentally or purposefully).  When mixing with plain water, you're going to have to dash a little water around in the cup and drink it to get the sediment in the bottom.As for the effects, I do experience enhanced well being while taking this stuff.  I just feel good.  I will also note that because it has ginseng, you will experience a mild stimulant effect.  If you are sensitive to stimulants, I would be careful when taking this late at night as you might have trouble sleeping.  The effect is mild (not nearly as strong as caffeine), but it is there.As for the taste, yes, NOW did change the flavor and in my opinion it is for the better.  It now has a peppermint taste which is much easier on the tastebuds for me than the original flavor (which was borderline disgusting).  However, it's worth noting that if you mix this with fruit juice or any sort of other drink, the new flavor might clash with it a little.So overall I would give this 4.5/5 stars, with a slight ding due to taste and mixability issues.

In your coffey grinder or similar: grind 6 almonds, 6 pecans, 1 tea spoon of sesame seeds, 6 whole cocoa beans, 6 coffee beans, 1 inch of real cinnamon quill (you could use powder, provided you are SURE it is the REAL cinnamon, not the Cassia type), 1 tea spoon of fennel seeds and 1 of fennugreek.Put the ground mixture in the blender. Add 1 tea spoon of spirulina, and 1 tea spoon of Green Phyto Foods (both from NOW brand). Add 1 tea spoon of turmeric powder. Add organic soy milk, non flavored, or organic almond or rice milk (whichever taste you prefer). Turn on the blender gently (to avoid the dust cloud explosion, lol), and once the mixture has begun to blend with the dry ingredients, you can turn up the speed. Blend for 30 seconds, serve in a big glass with a big straw, and enjoy! If you drink this every day, you'll probably never be hungry for anything else again. At least that is what it does to me.

Only thing I was sad about is that it works for maybe 6 hours before needing to be filled again."],["When I got this diffuser, I was excited about it.  It was a pretty good price from what I know about just shopping around online.  I am new to essential oils and diffusing them, so I wanted to buy an inexpensive model to get started before I commit to buying a $100+ model for a bigger space. (And I have to save up, that's a big investment for me!)  I chose this one because the reviews were mostly positive for a diffuser under $50.  I read all the directions that came with it and followed them perfectly.  I turned it on, diffusing 4 drops of Frankincense and it began diffusing nicely.  I could smell the oil, the mist was fine and cool.  About 30 minutes after I had turned it on, I noticed that the light was off and it wasn't diffusing any more.  The directions say that it will auto shut off when the water gets down to a certain level.  I checked the water level, and it was almost completely full.  Turned it back on and it started diffusing again.  I noticed this problem throughout the first day of use:  about every 30 minutes or so, I would notice that it had turned itself off again.  Rather than immediately return it to Amazon, I decided to try the customer service number.  I was connected with a real person after a few minutes on hold.  I explained the problem.  The customer service rep told me that it will run \"UP TO 8 hours, but it should definitely diffuse for at least 3.\"  She said that she would send me a new one.  I asked if I should send my current unit back to them.  She said no, just keep it and dispose of it when your new one gets there. I was overall very pleased with the customer service experience.  Hopefully my new one will come soon.  I'm planning on keeping this defective one around.  It's fine as long as I'm sitting right next to it to turn it back on whenever it shuts down.  So besides my unit being defective, here are the pros and cons.Pros:It's almost silent and pretty compact.The lights rotate showing really pretty colors.  I like that I can stop on my favorite one or turn the lights off.It is easy to set up and seems like it will be easy to clean, though I haven't done it yet.The shape of it makes it hard to tip over, which is important when you have little kids like I do.Customer service was helpful and very reasonable.Cons:  It's small size makes it not very powerful.  It would be great for a small office or bedroom, but I have an apartment with a very open floor plan.  If you need to diffuse for a big room, I would recommend getting something bigger and more powerful.As others have said, the power light stays on if it's running, and the power light is pretty bright.  It might bug you if you are diffusing at night and you want your room pitch black.My star rating is for my specific (defective) unit.  If and when I get a new one, I will update my rating.***UPDATE***My new unit came in a few weeks.  When it got here though, I didn't even take it out of the packaging because I had gotten my original unit to work.  I cleaned it as per the directions using 1oz water and 1oz white vinegar.  I let the mixture sit in the diffuser for about 20 minutes, then wiped it out with a Q-tip, focusing on the white disc in the center.  After a few cycles of diffusing and cleaning, it worked its way up to diffusing several hours.  I haven't timed how long it works now, but it diffuses at least 5 straight hours.  I'm keeping the replacement in the closet in case my original does go kaput someday.  I can't use both of them at the same time because they only sent me a base , not a top, and it won't work without the top.  I changed my original rating from 3 to 5 stars.

Like most vitamins, this B-complex is best absorbed if taken just before, with or just after a meal.  Because they boost energy, B vitamins (and C) are best taken first thing in the morning.  Even better is to split the dosage in half and take 1/2 at breakfast and 1/2 at lunch; splitting the dose helps keep high levels in your system throughout the day, as B vitamins (and C) are water soluble and therefore tend to pass through the body quickly.  I don't recommend taking B vitamins (or C) in the evening (unless you work nights!) as it can keep you up half the night (due to the energy level boost).This last time purchasing, I somehow ended up with the sugar free version sold on this page, although that is not what I intended to order; may have been an oops on my part as the description for this product isn't clear and the picture is so small it is impossible to make out the words \"Sugar Free\" above the words \"B-Complex\".  Prior to this I have avoided the sugar free version because it contains Xylitol which generally makes me violently sick -  I opened and took one of these tablets before I realized they were sugar free, but fortunately there seems to be a small enough amount used in these tablet that it hasn't been bothering me.  However I would suggest buying the normal version, as the difference in calories is small and xylitol really isn't good for anyone, plus the normal version tastes much better.Since the this site does not specify, here is the breakdown from the label (this is from the Sugar Free version - calories are a little more in the normal version as it contains sugar instead of sugar alcohols and stevia, but the rest should be the same):Calories 15Sugars 0gSugar Alcohols 2.5gVitamin C as ascorbic acid 250mg (417%DV*);B-1 aka Thiamine as thiamine mononitrate 7.5mg (500%DV);B-2 aka Riboflavin 8.5mg (500%DV);B-3 aka Niacin as Niacinamide 50mg (250%DV);B-5 aka Pantothenic Acid as calcium d-pantothenate 50mg (500%DV);B-6 as Pyridoxine HCl 10mg (500%DV);B-7 aka Biotin 300mcg (100%DV);B-9 aka Folate as Folic Acid 400mcg (100%DV);B-12 aka Cobalamin as Cyanocobalamin Concentrate 30mcg (500%DV);Inositol 30mg **;PABA (Para-Aminobenzoic Acid 20mg **;Stress and Vitamin C support base; bioflavonoid concentrate from citrus, acerola, rose hips 30mg **;Choline as choline bitartrate 30mg **.Other Ingredients: Sorbitol, Xylitol, Natural Flavors, Guar Gum, Stearic Acid, Silica, Whole Rice Concentrate, Citric Acid and Stevia.* Percent Daily Value** Daily Value not established."],["B-Complex is best taken in the morning to give you energy all day.

I have the 3 pieces with lunch without a problem, but the whole one bothers me.I actually seem to get better results from Bluebonnet B-complex 50 Vcaps. (Avoid 100mg capsules. It's overkill and likely to upset your stomach.) I am totally dependent on B-complex to function, and some formulas just don't do the trick for me, but these are the two I've found that work. I get best results taking them with Ester-C 1000mg and Peter Gillham's Natural Calm (magnesium citrate powder). Most people who need vitamin B complex also need extra C and magnesium because they all work together in many bodily processes.That combination is the treatment of choice for fibromyalgia, mitral valve prolapse syndrome, chronic fatigue, adrenal insufficiency (nervous collapse/nervous breakdown), depression, any nerve disorder, or a sensitivity to MSG (monosodium glutamate), and an important facet of the treatment of chemical sensitivity, asthma, heart disease,and Alzheimers Disease. (To recover from all of those, you also need a lot of exercise outside in nature, extra vitamin D, lots of clean non-fluoridated, de-chlorinated water, and a balanced diet with lots of natural fruits and vegetables - not cooked in a microwave, which destroys the phytonutrients.)Ester-C is a good choice of C to accompany it because it is gentler on the stomach - tolerated even by people who have trouble with C - and it includes some of the phytonutrients that make C more effective."],["I've taken Solary B-Complex for years.

It's a cute little gummy vitamin but the B-complex may not be as complete as it should be.  I found this Solaray wafer to be a better complex when comparing the ingredients of the two.  Now, it's not as tasty and it's quite a bit bigger and it's chalky because it's not a gummy, but it's pleasant enough and once it's chewed and swallowed you can forget all about it anyway.Here's how the B-complex in the two measures up:  The Solaray has 2 B vitamins not found in the gummies: B-1 (7.5 mg) and B-2 (8.5 mg).  The Solaray also contains PABA (20 mg), Bioflavonoid Complex (30 mg) and Choline (30 mg) and the gummy does not.  Now as for the B vitamins they have in common, only B-12 and Folic Acid are of the same strength in both:  400 mcg and 30 mcg respectively.  Niacin is 50 mg for the Solaray and 20 mg for the gummy.  B-6 is 10 mg v 2 mg.  Biotin is 300 mg v 75 mg.  Pantothenic Acid is 50 mg v 10 mg.The amounts of Vitamin C and Inositol differ also.  It's 250 mg of C for the Solaray and 15 mg for the gummy.  Inositol is 30 mg in the Solaray and 7 in the gummy.So if you're interested in a more complete B-complex, Solaray is the way to go.

Also, I was living in S.California and allergic to sunscreen when I began using it. My age spots faded by 2/3. All this I can see with my age-diminished vision, so I imagine it's really amazing. I thought it might be too oily for my oily skin - I have a couple of pimples on any given day, so I switched to the Day Cream, but found the results dropped off.

I also have large, visible pores and a few red spots where I have broken capillaries. When I smile, I notice fine lines all over my face, and those pesky lines that go from the nose to the corners of the mouth (sometimes I see the lines when I'm not smiling). All of these problems supposedly can be helped with the use of DMAE, C-Ester, and alpha lipoic acid. I should mention that while I think have awful lines and wrinkles, my friends and family don't think it's so bad (but then again, are they just being nice? Or is it really not as bad as I think?)Last year, I tried the Derma E Rejuventating (or was is Revitalizing? It was something that started with an 'R') creme, which came in two 1 oz. jars, so I used it until it was gone. I noticed that my skin was a little firmer. Not in a way that someone looking at me could see, but if I pulled on my skin a little, it felt a little... thicker? fattier? It feels like there's more substance to it (though I haven't gained weight, and my face doesn't LOOK fatter). When that ran out, I tried this product, the Skin Eternal Cream. From all of the reviews and the product description, it sounds like the ideal cream that has all of the effective ingredients at an affordable price. I've been using this every night before I go to bed for about two months now (several of the reviews say that it will take a month to notice any effects). First, using my fingers, I apply it around my eyes, then all over my face. It is a greasy formula, and the smell... It really is like some of the other customers have said. It's a little bit like popcorn + coconut (or something tropical) + medication. I have gotten used to it over the past two months and I don't notice it at all now. I've been vigilant about using it every single night, and so I have to be vigilant about washing my face every single morning, because so much dust and fuzz and whatnot from my pillows now sticks to my face (not visibly, but when I use a cotton ball to wash, I can see that there was stuff (like lint or something) on my face, which didn't happen with other moisturizers I have used). After two months, the only change I have noticed is that my skin is a little bit firmer, like with the other cream. However, the lines, wrinkles, crow's feet, dark circles, etc. have not improved at all.I read so many of the positive reviews that I really am starting to wonder if I'm missing something? Am I doing something wrong? Does anyone have any tricks for applying this? I plan on using it until I run out, and then I'll search for some other product with DMAE, C-Ester and alpha lipoic acid. This product doesn't bother me or cause me any problems, but I haven't seen any real results. (Ok, it's a LITTLE weird to be so greasy/shiny at night, if anyone calls me and I've already applied this stuff, I won't go out.) I really would appreciate advice from anyone who uses this. Does anyone apply it twice at night? Or in the morning? (The directions on the jar say to use it at night, and that there is a different cream for the daytime, has anyone used that as well?). Or are there tips in general for applying moisturizers and face creams?Honestly, my wrinkles aren't awful, and many people don't think I'm 29 (but maybe it's my personality, who knows?), so I didn't think that I would be expecting much by hoping that my wrinkles would go away. But they haven't diminished AT ALL. If someone asked me for a recommendation of this product, I might say, \"Eh, go ahead and try it. It made my skin feel a little firmer. For a lot of people on Amazon.com it seemed to work wonders, but I didn't really see an improvement. But it might work better for you. It wasn't awful, so I wouldn't 'not recommend' it.\""],["I love the skin cream. It smells so good and is so thick and creamy. The product arrived timely and was just as described.

But it isn't bad and I'm more than happy to work with it. I just need a bit lighter hand.  Results are what I'm looking for and it's giving me what I wanted.  It does leave an after shine but I'll be playing with finishers to add after it's absorbed so that my makeup/or no makeup looks better.Several posts mention eye irritation but I thought I'd be more careful and have no problem.  I think that the product sinks so well into your skin (which is a good thing) that it's not that you get it in your eyes but it's absorbed into the eye socket ares and you start to tear.  I was supper careful each time and it still happened.  So I order the eye cream for this area.  It apparently doesn't have the acid component but everything else so it cuts down on the irritation.  It will be worth it because I want to use it for both day and night.  Perhaps my sunscreen will matte the finish a bit.  Anyway, love the product. Arrived as expected.

I use this product as part of my son's bio medical treatment.  My son has high functioning autism and responded really well with this product. I also tried it and could feel the increased awareness and concentration.When taking B12 vitamin orally, you have to let it dissolve slowly in your mouth so you can get as much as possible into the bloodstream and by bypassing the digestion. If you simply swallow it, it would just go directly into your digestive system and get secreted right away through urine. That's why the shots are very effective for extreme B12 deficiency because then it goes directly into the blood stream. I highly recommend this product especially if you need to try out your tolerance for methyl B12 before trying out other forms.  Knowing that my son responded well to the oral methyl B12, I started him on the methyl B12 shots and saw huge improvements; he used to hit, kick, and scream at school, and was very impulsive, but as soon as he started the shots he no longer has those issues AT ALL.This one tastes good, and if you just put it behind your upper lip, and move it around every now and then, you don't even have to think about it until it fully dissolves.For more information on methyl B12 treatments for autism, visit [...]"],["I am taking Source Naturals Methylcobalamin [Vitamin B-12] sublingual tabs in an effort to regenerate damaged peripheral nerves.

When you swallow something - food, water or medication it is absorbed by your digestive system, the blood flow from your digestive system all goes through the liver before going into the blood stream.  The liver deactivates many toxins and chemicals that have been swallowed, as well as digesting your food on a molecular level.  It also does the same for drugs, toxins and chemicals in the general blood stream, but at a much slower rate.Some drugs and vitamins, when swallowed, are significantly broken down as they pass through the liver on the way to the general blood stream.  This is called the \"first pass effect\" and with some drugs it is so significant that the dose given sublingually or by injection needs to be only 1/50th as much as a swallowed dose.When you take a sublingual drug or vitamin it goes right into the general blood stream, bypassing the liver.  But the drug or vitamin which is not absorbed by the mouth tissue is then swallowed and winds up going through the liver, being degraded by the first pass effect.So it makes sense that you want a sublingual drug to dissolve slowly, to get the maximum absorption in the mouth, not in the stomach or intestine.  A sublingual tablet that dissolves rapidly is not much different than swallowing a pill.I like this formulation and recommend it to people who take Prilosec or Nexium on a regular basis, as they are likely not getting enough B12 absorbed, even if they are swallowing a B12 pill regularly."]],"title":"Source Naturals MethylCobalamin Vitamin B-12, Cherry Flavored, 5 MG,120 Tablets","total_reviews":23,"sentiment":0.6622434783,"label":"positive","best_review":["Best b 12.

It absolutely amazes me that all the doctors I've been to have been so ignorant about supplements that they have not known about this easy-to-try remedy. I had been taking a multi B supplement, but not B2 in particular.  Within 2 days of starting on 400 mg/day, I was able to wean myself off the other treatment meds I'd been taking for headaches.  Those meds had been helping, but they'd also been causing rebound headaches.  Once I got out of that cycle and got all that other medicine out of my system, I could function without other medication except a low level of preventative med.  Once in a while I still get a migraine out of nowhere, but it is very seldom compared with my previous life before B2.

Then, 2 hrs before the exam I took one of each again just to make sure that my brain won't shut down while I;m taking the test. Believe it or not, I did not crash the whole day and got an A.

First, I use a lot of Source Naturals products, and in my experience, they are always of high quality at a very reasonable price.Now as to why I'm taking this supplement...I'm working on recovering from chronic fatigue syndrome caused by leaky gut and gut dysbiosis (severe Candida infection for the last several years). I've read that people take 15-20 g of this a day to heal the gut. I started taking it on an empty stomach before meals, and the effects have been life-changing; and, no, I'm not being dramatic. It turns out that during times of stress, glutamine in the skeletal muscle can become depleted by up to 50% (perhaps even more based on some statistics I've read). The body needs glutamine to fuel immune cells and to repair tissues; the liver needs glutamine for detoxification, etc. So the body snags from skeletal muscle the glutamine that it needs. Although the body is able to make glutamine from other amino acids in the diet, during periods of prolonged stress (like chronic infection or disease), the diet simply is unable to provide a sufficient supply. This has certainly been true in my case. I seem to eat and eat all day long, but it's never enough for all the repair that is going on inside my body - yet I still have no energy. It's frustrating. This product has changed that. I'm not miraculously cured or anything like that, but it has certainly made a big difference in my quality of life as I continue to recover. I've got a lot more energy now, much less muscle aches, less difficulty digesting, and less allergies after eating. I am able to sleep through the night without waking due to hypoglycemia, and I no longer wake in the morning with muscle pain and fatigue.

After trying this supplement for a few months, I am not convinced. The good part of this supplement is that the price is pretty cheap.
