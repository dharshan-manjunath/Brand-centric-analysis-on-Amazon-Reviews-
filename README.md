Brand-centric-analysis-on-Amazon-Reviews
The repo cantains Brand centric analysis done on Amazon reviews

1. Popular 5 categories are selected for analysis based on number of reviews.
2. Top 8 brands are selected based on sentiment score. LDA is performed on all reviews of the brand and visualized in word cloud.
3. Top 5 products of each brand is visualized with sentiment word cloud.

Key Findings:

We noticed a correlation between the total number of reviews and the total number of positive reviews of a product. A product with more reviews meant more people bought the product and tended to give more positive reviews.

1. The rating distribution of the selected products are between 4 and 5. This means that poorly rated products have smaller review count and did not make it onto our list of top 8 products.
2. LDA produced a clear delineation of topics for a count of 4 for all brands such as customers opinion, product variety, product quality, product specs and delivery time etc.
3. Sentiment word cloud of every product has positive sentiment which clearly depicts customers have good opinion on the top products.
