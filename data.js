I purchased the combo version of the Super Champ X2 to be a portable practice amp without giving up too much of the tone of a bigger tube amp.  I was not disappointed in the slightest.  There isn't anything that this little guy doesn't do well.  The voices and effects are phenomenal. I highly doubt there is a tone out there that you couldn't nail down with the pre-loaded modeling and the Fender Fuse software.For those in an apartment or condo situation, the X2 is perfect. (Another main reason for my purchase)  It still pumps out great sound at low volume.  Also, there isn't nearly as steep of a &#34;volume&#34; cliff.  If you've owned other solid-state amps, you know what I mean. There is a much more gradual decrease in volume on the low end.  So, you don't get that situation where it is either in full-on beast mode or just plain off.Pros:Excellent Build QualityDelicious Tone at Any VolumeVery VersatileGreat for Those in Small Living QuartersPortabilityCons:Doesn't Come w/ A Foot Switch (Can be difficult to find)Doesn't Come w/ the Dust Cover (Like Some Other Fender Amps)There are quite a few fantastic demos on YouTube.  I encourage you to check them out.If you pick one up, I hope you enjoy your X2 as much as I'm enjoying mine!"],["A great little amplifier.  Good quality, good built in effects, and is still easy to carry around.  I replaced the stock speaker with an Eminence Rajun Cajun, which has improved the tone and provided increased volume. The amp is now capable of being used at small gigs. I would highly recommend."],["I recently bought a Fender Super-Champ X2 amp, (the combo version). The sound quality is impressive, especially for the price. It is very tube like and the effects are quite good (for built effects), particularly the Fender spring reverb. I compared it to a reissue Deluxe Reverb and left the store with the Champ.The Mustang III (V2) is a great amp as well and I have one of those too, but even though it contains many amp models and effects, in some cases it does not quite nail the tube amp sound. I am using these amps only for recording so sound quality and noise and/or hiss levels are important. Jazz, pop, rock and blues are among the types of music I play.I was concerned that this amp would more or less duplicate the functionality of the Mustang III amp, but it doesn't. It is a different amp with it's own sound.If you want a small, relatively low power tube amp (15-20 watts), this is it. If you are gigging, consider the head model with two speaker cabinets or one cabinet containing 2 - 12 inch speakers. Make sure the total combined impedance of your speakers is 8 ohms, as there is no switch for different speaker impedances. If you use speakers that have a high SPL efficiency with this amp, the sound level can be equivalent to a 40 or 50 watt amp. If you need more power than that, consider a Twin Reverb.This amp has two footswitch controls - one for channel select (Clean or AMP models) and one for Effects on/off.RecommendedBobztEngineer"],["Absolutely love this amp.  It sounds amazing.  It has that warm and clear tube amp sound.  And it gets loud.  It also has a variety of voicings where you can simulate the sounds of other classic Fender amps.  The FX available on channel 2, including reverb, chorus, and delay, are another added bonus.The ability to plug this into your computer and modify the presets for the various voices or FX is just another bonus.  I can't say enough good things about this amp.I would definitely recommend it."],["I finally upgraded to the world of full tubes and couldn't be happier. I was always looking for that &#34;fat 60's distortion&#34; and could not find it until tubes came along. After reading everything in print about tube amps in this price range I finally decided on the Super Champ. It arrived early and unblemished. She plays like a dream, and I hope to keep her for life. Thanks Fender and Amazon!"],["Like the amp.Would be good for practice or recording. Would just need to be a little louder. Maybe go to eleven!"],["This is a very well designed amp. It features a wide range of sounds and is quite portable. The price is also reasonable for the value. I would recommend it highly."],["I've been using this amp for a few months and I'm very pleased with the overall quality and performance. I was looking for a small studio amp and watched the demo video on YouTube. I ordered it through Amazon and it arrived quickly. The amp has two shades or flavors as I call it. I only use the clean side or input one. This is what Fender calls Blaceface Clean. No matter how hard you push that channel it won't break up and sounds great with no FX's running. I really haven't used channel two much. These are all your pre-sets which many amps are doing these days. I'm pretty much old school and like to find my own sound. However they do sound very good and you can change a lot of these settings both from the front panel and through your computer. The amp itself hooks right into your USB connection such as Gargeband or other recording boards or software. The amp is all tube and sounds better the longer you leave it on... It's a loud 15 watts... I have used this amp on smaller gigs without any problems. If your looking for a studio/home/1st amp you can't go wrong with this guy. It's now my go to amp in the studio. You can make this amp sound many different ways and with an FX chain in front of channel one (how I run it) the sky is the limit. Haven't used the software that you need to download from Fender but will look at it later. right now this amp doesn't need to be tweaked for me...I loved it right out of the box! Give it a test drive and let your ears decide..."],["Excellent amplifier. The straight tube has the great classic Fender sound that I expected, and the digital effects are very good as well. Although to be fair I'm still figuring out the effects..."],["This is the greatest practice amp ever.  And by practice I mean practicing by yourself and with a band.First, it's all tube, so it sounds really good.  It's gets nice and dirty as you crank it and sounds warm at all volumes.  It also takes pedals well and can sound like a beast.Second, it's 15 watts and is pretty darn loud.  I've used it for band practice and it's definitely loud enough to keep up with a drummer.  At a bar you'll probably need to mic it or use the included line-out.Third, if the 10&#34; speaker isn't loud enough, you can plug it into a cabinet to push more air, it sounds great in the 4x12 and 2x12 cabs I have.  That'll make it loud enough for most bars.Fourth, it has great sounding built in effects, nearly everything you'll need.  Most small tube amps don't have built in effects.  So if you're trying to practice down in the living room, you're forced to drag your effects with you.  That's annoying.  With this amp everything is built in.Fifth, unlike a lot of tube amps, this one gets very quiet.  You can turn it way down, keep the warm tone, and practice without bothering anyone else.Sixth, the price is amazing.  All tube, build in effects, and line and speaker out... wow.  Fender is basically giving these things away.I love this amp so much I want to buy one for every guitarist I know.  The only downsides are that it does not come with a cover and a footswitch.  But considering the price, that's understandable. There's no reason to include those if most people are not going to use them.  You'll only want the cover and footswitch if you're playing in a band."],["Just received my Super-Champ X2 after reviewing very carefully.  I opened the box and saw that the Volume 2 knob was broken into pieces.  This has caused me to question overall quality of the amp.  I ran the amp through it's paces and it seems to live up to it's reputation.  However, I was pretty surprised that an amp which has been reviewed so well from a supplier who has such a good reputation would deliver a product with such an obvious and visible flaw.  Jury is out on this amp....I'll see how it goes and maybe ask Amazon to provide a new knob if it holds up....OK...day later.  the amp is pretty incredible.  I'll get a new knob."],["It is a true tube amp at a good price. And it comes with modeling features too.The sound of the clean channel (tube only) is really amazing, both with a Les Paul and with a Strato. You can immediately listen the tube sound, smooth, with high dynamics, good headroom and amazing pick response. It is also very sensitive to the pickup selection. The 10&#34; speaker delivers a good amount of low end and you can fell that on your chest even at low volumes.The voice modeled channel has 16 preset voices and they are really convincing. They shape the tone and it goes to the tube amp section maintaining that tube sound characteristics. It is much better than other modeling apparatus I tested, like SW emulators and similar stuff. You can play hours and hours (perhaps days) messing with these voices before getting bored. they really sound good.The effects section has a good reverb, with a big thumbs up for the spring reverb, and also chorus (very pleasant), vibratone and delay. All effects are high quality.The overall volume is really good and the amp can even be used for small gigs. It seems to be very suitable to records too.It is compatible with Fender Fuse software, that allows you to increase the flexibility of the amp by changing the modeling and effects. I haven't used it yet, so I can't tell how good it is."],["I'm a meticulous great tone practitioner with my Les Paul and Fender Strat. For three decades of performances I've used a vintage 1966 black face Fender Vibrolux Reverb. So Im really spoiled. But this little baby is the perfect practice and recording amp for the studio with its tube circuit and impressive modeling capabilities on channel 2. I prefer the vintage Fender Twin modeling setting while letting my pedals do the rest of the tone shaping. Bravo Fender for 350 bucks!"],["Purchased the SCX2 after quickly determining that the two \"budget\" solid state Fender amps I'd tried were not to my taste sonically and limited in terms of features, though undeniably both represented a very good value at their respective price points. For a modestly increased budget outlay, the SCX2 combo afforded me the benefits of superior tonal warmth and pick response by way of the tube power output section (I'm playing a Standard Tele), an almost limitless range of tones that can be produced via the combination of capable onboard effects (15, incl. combinations), a responsive EQ section, 16 amp models (some very convincing and most all quite useable) and the added customization capabilities (including virtual stomp boxes, post signal processers and even \"deep\" edits such as virtual SAG and bias) that are enabled by downloading the FUSE software and hooking up the amp to my computer. All in a \"grab and go\" package that weighs in at only 25 lbs. and produces rich sound at modest practice volumes. The build and appearance are of the high quality that is customary to Fender products, though I docked the amp a point for the stock speaker, which though capable at modest volumes, became somewhat unstable at higher volumes and in high-gain applications. An easy swap to an Eminence Legend 1058 proved to be very satisfying and better utilizes the vast tonal possibilities of the amp while retaining the classic \"Fender chime\" of Channel 1. Additionally, by investing in a budget amp stand, I was able to achieve improved projection and a tighter low end while bringing the amp controls within comfortable reach. All in all, an outstanding value and versatile amplifier for the low-volume livingroom hobbyist or garage band jammer looking for access to a broad range of guitar sounds."],["It's small and portable, but heavier because it has tubes. Great warm tone. Great quality. Wish it came with some rubber casters, but nothing I can't do myself."],["I have owned many solid state and modeling amplifiers, including a few of the Vox Valvetronix series.  However, this is both my first Fender amp, as well as my first true &#34;tube&#34; amp.  First, some clarification is needed on &#34;tube&#34; vs. &#34;modeling&#34; amp.  The Fender Super Champ X2 is absolutely a tube amp - it has one 12AX7 and two 6V6's, and they are involved in both the preamp and power amp stages.  However, the amplifier has a modeling component on top of that true tube tone, which is what allows it to project different &#34;voices&#34;.  Contrary to what some posters have written, Channel 1 does also have some front-end modeling, except that the the model is fixed for &#34;Blackface&#34; tone and controlled by a separate volume know (no gain control).  Channel 2 offers 16 different &#34;Voice&#34; presets and 10 of these model a variety of vintage Fender amplifiers, including the Tweed Deluxe, Bassman, Deluxe, Princeton, and Twin.  Settings 9-15 model a variety of other popular amps, including the Vox AC30 and Marshall.Overall, I found the available tones to be excellent.  Unlike my Valvetronix, where I more or less settled on a particular setting and used it at all times, I could really see myself flipping between the different models and seeing how they respond to different guitars.  One thing that should be noted if you plan on changing models frequently - you may have to adjust volume, gain, bass, and treble to dial in the same amount of volume as you move from amp to amp.  However, I found the levels to be much more uniform in output than in other amps with a modeling component.  Also, the X2 does not suffer from a lot of the excess noise or &#34;hissing&#34; you hear with digital modeling amps.The tones that come out of the 10&#34; speaker of the Super Champ X2 are very rich and touch-responsive, as you'd expect from a tube amp.  The amp has TONS of high-end sparkle, but some of the settings only start to open up if you increase the volume (true of many amps).  The stock speaker, which is Fender's own design (and has a ceramic magnet, I believe), is frequently criticized as a weak point.  However, it is certainly passable and if you are new to tube amps (or only intend on playing at bedroom levels), you're unlikely to take issue with it.  The Eminence Ragin' Cajun is a commonly suggested replacement that apparently adds significant amounts of output and low end.  But, again, the amp is plenty loud and full-sounding for its size.  Better intended for home/studio use than most gigs, but it excels at what it does.That brings us to the effects section and the Fender FUSE software that works with the amp via USB cable.  Frankly, I'm not a fan of most on-board effects with combo amplifiers.  I prefer to use pedals for modulation, delay, and some overdrive/distortion.  The good new is that the on-board reverbs (which include spring, room, hall, and a few others if you install them from the software) are quite good.  You can also reassign the presets to different effects.  So, if you want a flanger with a reverb, you can have a setting for that.  If you want a different type of delay mixed with a particular reverb, you can do that too.  The Tap Tempo button is a great modern convenience to go with those effects.  But, as I said, while they represent a good value for players that don't want to invest in pedals, I'm more likely to use my Boss DD-3 than the on-board delay, and so on.The build quality of the Super Champ X2 is largely excellent.  The grill is wound tightly and with the same convincing shimmer of some of Fender's more expensive amps.  The amp weighs in at 24 pounds and is extremely portable with the handle on top.  One thing I did note, however, is that the knobs protrude and seem like they would be very easy to damage while transporting, so I will have to be careful about that.  Also, there are a couple of seams for the tolex material on top of the amp that look like they could have been hidden better.  But overall, the amp looks very well constructed.  I was initially concerned about the digital aspects taking away from the tube amp aesthetic, but everything is mapped to vintage-looking knobs, and from a few feet back, the amp looks just as much at home in the 60's as it does post-2000.Overall, I think this is an excellent value and a quality amp that I hope to enjoy for years to come.  I'm only really scratching the surface of its potential, but it makes great Fender tone sound easy.  The Fender FUSE software could be a little more intuitive to work with, and I wish there were a better way to know what each of the Voice and F/X settings correspond to without consulting a chart.  But it's a great little amplifier that's all the power you'd need for hobbyists and studio recording, and it could probably handle some smaller gigs as well."],["This amp sounds phenomenal for such a small package and a single 10 inch speaker!  It sounds great right out of the box.The overdrive channels amp models are some of the best I've heard from modelers, pedals etc. Not much use for any of my many pedals with this amp because better tones are already in the presets and I havent even looked at the fuse software yet.I am very happy with this amp and it sounds great at lower volumes.  If you mic up this will work for small gigs.  The build seems very good.I don't think you can find a better sounding brand new amp for this price."],["I picked up one of these little gems on sale and was very surprised. The sound is very authentic as I have a 60's tube Champ in excellent working order for reference, as well as a Deville.This little amp has the classic Fender tube sound, with a broad, punchy tone and the right amount of compression. The included digital effects, (vibraphone, delay, reverb, chorus and tremolo) are all convincing and well executed.The modeling portion of the amp is also well done and includes voicing for a tweed champ, tweed deluxe clean/dirty, baseman, 65 princeton clean/dirty, 65 deluxe clean/dirty, 65 twin and an array of british and metal amps.All and all, a super practice amp or mic-able performance amp.

This bass is super-well-put-together. ****sorry about all the hyphens***. I did a little adjusting out of the box (screwdriver, allen wrench) and put on my preferred strings and got right to work.Nice quiet pickups. Super light. BONUS: it makes you seem like a larger person than you really are, since it's that much smaller than a standard sized bass. Delightful silver finish. NOTE: if you are actually a fairly small, diminutive, elfish sort of person, onlookers might see you with this bass and mistakenly assume you are farther away than you really are! This could be handy if, for example, you have the farts, and they are within nose-shot of you, but they'll never know it was you because they'll mistakenly assume you're too far away to be the culprit!If there were a FRETLESS version of this, or a short-scale neck readily available from a third party to make it fretless, I'd be even more stoked.

Once online he saw this one and fell in love so we ordered it, even though we couldn't even try it first.  He's never been so happy!  It sounds amazing both played on it's own and in the Rocksmith game, as we are letting our kids try it out with that.  Really nice rich sound for less than half what we paid for a cruddy Deans.  Extremely pleased.  This arrived about a week ahead of schedule and was packed amazingly well.  No problems what so ever.  Very pleased with this transaction."],["I got this bass for my 8 year old who expressed an interest in bass.  The short scale makes it easier for him to reach the notes.

Might change the pots, tapers come up fast from 8 or 9 to 10. Should hold up well, made it through shipping. Someone stepped in the middle of the box breaking the cardboard.

I can't knock the electronics; the pups and the pots are nicely responsive and clean. The neck is smooth and on the faster side.My gripe was in quality control of the body and finish. It seemed to almost come as a used unit, or B stock. There were several considerably obvious and deep nicks in the finish on the upper side, almost as if someone had banged it into something over and over. I'm surprised Fender let this one out the door.I also have the full-sized one, in the red, and it's a great sounding, great playing bass - and in red it's very nice to look at as well. The fit and finish on that one is excellent. I'm sure this incident was a one-off, but it still happened."],["This bass is nice to look at, as well as being easy to play.

This maintains my high expectations of service from Amazon, and I will continue to do business here."],["Was looking for a short scale bass, after looking at the Ibanez bought the Squire, I have 3 other basses and this out of the box can't be beat for the price. Sure, for more money you get more bass but this one will do you just fine as an additional instrument. Looks nice, sounds nice, and is very light weight compared to other long scale Basses. Yes, I would recommend this to any other serious musician."],["If you're in the market for a bass like this one -- short scale and low budget -- then you won't be disappointed. I'm very pleased with this bass. I found a tutorial on adjusting intonation and it took me about 15 minutes to adjust it. Most of the adjusters were exactly where they needed to be; only two of them needed a little bit of adjustment, and now the intonation is very good, basically perfect. The action is good too -- no complaints. It's low enough to be easy to play, but not so low that it buzzes, although the low E does occasionally buzz a little. The fretboard is nice and the neck is slim, and the inlay on the back of the neck really adds a nice touch that classes up the guitar.As others have noted, the neck is short enough to make guitar players feel comfortable with it, and it's also workable for a kid of about 12 years old too. It's lighter than the typical bass but it's not exactly lightweight. The aforementioned 12 year-old feels the weight quickly and needs to sit down, but it's much better than a full-scale bass. He picked it up and started playing it right away, which he probably couldn't have done with a full-sized bass.The pickups sound OK and the knobs work fine. I might wish for a little more \"snappy\" sound out of it, and an obvious upgrade would be better pickups. Overall the guitar is definitely good enough to justify spending that money on an upgrade, and I'll probably do that eventually.I would mention that the silver paint is really metallic silver; it's NOT gray as it appears in the photos. It's got this metal flake thing going on, which you might or might not like. I kind of wish I'd gotten black. In the pictures, the red looks like nail polish to me. But that's just a matter of personal taste I guess.Thanks Fender and Squier! This is a terrific entry level bass with lots of room for growth!"],["I've been playing bass for over 30 years, and have never been a fan of short-scale basses, but after playing this bass, I'm adding my 5-star review to the mix because this is a great instrument for the money.  I saw one in a local music store and was amazed by its sound and playability at this price.  They didn't have a silver one in stock (my preference), so I ordered one through Amazon.Mine arrived today, and the fit and finish are excellent - no flaws that I can find.  The frets were smooth, the paint job is perfect, all controls and hardware are tight. The set up was even fine - I didn't even need to adjust any strings for intonation!As others have noted, the jazz bass pickup (in the bridge position) is weak, but the p-bass split pickup is nice and warm. The neck is fast, and the body is light.  Squier hit the nail on the head with this one.This is a super deal for a beginner or for someone who wants to add a short scale bass to their arsenal."],["There are some bassists who will hear the words Squier, and the words short-scale and be put off.  This little bass dispells concerns about sound and quality right out of the box.  I have the dysfunctional inability to leave instruments alone, so the first thing I did was a set-up with the addition of some DR Sunbeams.  I played it through my little Eden 200W combo practice amp, running the amp flat, with about half gain and about 1/4 the master volume.  What a shock.  Good, clear tone, NO HUM, and the DUH realization that this sounds like a Fender bass should.  Just for the hell of it, I dialed out the bridge pickup.  The split-coil p-bass pickup sounds great.  Fat and growly, but with surprisingly bright highs.  Good P-Bass tone.  As others have mentioned, the bridge pickup just adds color and really doesn't have the bite that my Jazz Bass has.  I like this bass well enough that I see a Duncan Vintage Jazz bridge PU in its future.  A 500 tone pot wouldn't hurt either.The fit and finish is very good.  I paid $169 for this bass from Amazon, and I can tell you I have found greater flaws on basses costing 5X this much.  The fret work is good.  Some of the fret cuts seem a little deep, but the set and finihs of the frest is fine.  Except for a small tweak on the D string, the harmonics were fine.  I was also pleasantly purprised by the machine heads.  I had purchased a Squier Vintage Modified Jazz Bass anbd had to replace the tuners with Schallers.  I don't think it will be necessary on this bass.  The neck had a small flaw in the poly finish, right at the top of the skunk stripe.  Otherwise, the neck is one of the best parts of this bass.  It's a short-scale Jazz Bass neck, nuff said.  All other features; the painted headstock, 3-ply pickguard, bridge are all of a quality that belie the price.So, why short-scale?  Well. for me it's for a couple of reasons.  I've played bass for over 45 years; gigged professionally for 17 of those. This means I am old.  My hands have taken some abuse over the years and, frankly, the 4-fret extensions on my P-Bass and Jazz bass can be uncomfortable when arthritis flares up.  I still have a fretless Jazz bass that is my main bass.  With short-scale basses, I have no problem.  Hell, it's fun to play them.  And it takes me back...My fist \"name\" bass was a Gibson EBO, also a 30-inch scale.  It was a unique sound that I loved.  I still have an EBO, and there is no better bass I like for blues than my EBO with flat-wound strings.  The Jaguar has the tone and brightness that the Gibson lacks; two different philosophies.  I play my basses through a Hartke VXL pedal and this Jaguar SS sounds great.  I have no problem gigging and recording with this guitar.  I bought the silver for no reason, but it's a great color in person.  I am very happy with this purchase, thanks Amazon, and with the quality of this bass from Squier.  In fact, I plan to find out what it will take to have a fretless version of this bass."],["If you need/want a short scale, this is THE one. I'm blown away with the sound of this bass for what it cost me. I like it better than my Fender deluxe P bass special. Deep bass when on the P pickup, punchy on the J pickup. Use the tone knob and you have endless tone possibilities.The only problems I have had were that the intonation was a little off out of the box (to be expected), the rosewood is too light for my liking (ended up staining it darker), and the pot for the J pickup drops off too quickly ($5 to replace). So buy this, get new CTS pots for it, and get a professional set up. You'll love it!"],["Having read a ton of reviews on this bass I found one today at my neighborhood guitar store. It was not heavy overall or neck heavy. The action was sweet. In fact, it played like butter. Plugged in? This cheap-o sounded as good as my P-bass.

Even two hundred would be worth it."],["At a buck under $200, this is a great bargain and a quality entry-level acoustic guitar.  The finish is of very high quality and the sound is quite nice.  The action is also better than one could hope for in a $199 guitar and the tuning pegs are excellent. It holds its tune very well, even with brand new strings (according to the Korg GA electronic tuner that I bought at the same time).  An added bonus is the well made fake leather hard case that is also a bargain at the price.  I'm sure more experienced guitarists could find fault and I'm sure a $1000-plus guitar would be better made/sound better, but this is a great place to start. The sunburst finish is very nice.  Amazon handled the transaction flawlessly also."],["IT'S A GREAT DEAL FOR THE PRICE, AND A GOOD GUITAR OF HIGH QUALITY. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT ANYONE WHO IS LOOKING FOR A DECENT GUITAR FOR A VERY REASONABLE PRICE, THIS IS A GREAT DEAL."],["I had a look at this guitar online and also read the reviews which all gave a positive impression of the product. When the guitar finally arrived it was the wrong darn color (it came in the natural colour instead of the the sunburst design which is the one advertised).I was pretty annoyed and very inconvenienced by having to return the big package and not sure if it's worth ordering another one."],["This is my 2nd guitar and my 1st acoustic. Let me just say i love this guitar! the finish is outstanding. It is just beautiful to look at. The sound quality is just outstanding! I barely strum it and it hums nicely!I would highly recommend this guitar!"],["I got this guitar from my boyfriend for Christmas 2010. I threw the guitar away yesterday (November 2nd,2011) after repeated visits to the local guitar shop. The neck twisted, the bridge lifted up off the body, which loosened the bracing and the tuning machines failed. Basically the guitar fell apart in less than a year. It only lasted that long because I stupidly kept getting the thing repaired.I contacted Fender and yes, a real person responded, but with the suggestion that I buy a way more expensive model (around $700), as this model is a \"beginner\" guitar. I AM a beginner- that's why I practice two hours a day!I'm sure it would be a great value if maybe your teenager thinks he/she might be interested in guitar playing, or if you only play occasionally, but someone who is really interested in learning and playing acoustic music should buy a different guitar. For $40 more than the Fender, I got a great guitar by Dean Guitars. It didn't come with a case, but I had my guitar guy look at it as soon as it arrived and he thinks I made a good choice and the guitar should last a lifetime with proper care. Dean is actually a respected name in moderately priced guitars.What you get from Fender for $200 is the logo and a guitar-shaped place to put it. If you want an actual instrument, expect to pay triple what this one costs."],["My first guitar and it arrived quicker than expected and included some bits and peices on top of what was in teh description.

She is a beginning player and could not be happier. It will be many years before she out grows this, if ever!"],["This guitar for just $200 is actually a very nice beginning guitar to start with.

Overall I would recommend this guitar to anyone who is looking to play around and have some fun, it's a great product"],["This guitar was amazing! Me and my husband got it for my brother's 18th birthday present. He wasn't expecting it at all and cried. And how many 18 year old boys do you know that cry? It was the best present that I could have gotten him. The case was super nice too! And the guitar was pretty in the sunburst~!"],["I received a natural finish instead of the white finish pictured. But the sound is beautiful and it came with a sturdy free case. Once the guitar was tuned it preformed as expected. This is my first guitar but my guitar teacher says that it's a beautiful guitar, great sound, good enough quality. I have had no problems with this guitar."],["I was amazed at how nice this guitar was. I am not really a musician but I know quality. The case was the best part it wasnt just some trashy case it was nicely lined and the guitar was beautiful. I had the guitar signed by Trace Adkins, Aaron Tippin, Kellie Pickler, Avenged Sevenfold,Joan Jett, and Craig Morgan. It arrived in exactly seven days and It arrived in great packaging. This is a great guitar if I were to order another I would probably get the CD-60CE with the Custom Electronics as I don't ever plan on playing this guitar though it is awesome to look at."],["I wish I had found this a few years ago when I bought a \"low end\" Martin.  This one is almost one quarter the price and sounds just as good if not better than the Martin. It does tend to go out of tune a little quicker, which I suppose means it's construction is of lesser quality, but it really sounds great with a bright ringing tone and deep bass. And it's very easy to play with nice action. If you tend to play regularly you will feel no pain to your finger pads--which is not something that can be said for most cheap guitars. I bought this because I wanted a second guitar for traveling and rough handling.  It's now my favorite guitar.It comes with a hard shell case. Again not the best case in the world, but perfectly useful.I can't recommend this guitar highly enough.  A great guitar for a beginner who is uncertain about his commitment to the instrument, but also a great guitar for a more accomplished player who is on a budget or who wants a back-up instrument."],["This guitar is just beautiful in every sense of the word. Not only is it beautiful to look at (very well built and very pretty) but it sounds beautiful as well. It arrived before the scheduled date and I live in Bermuda (which means it was first sent to New York and THEN to me). There were no damages or blemishes whatsoever. The case that it comes with is of a much better quality than I expected. It is well padded and has plenty of compartment space for all my extras which includes a strap, fingernail clippers, guitar polish, fretboard oil, string cleaner, extra strings, extra plectrums, a tuning dial winder, a tuner and even more. The guitar came already set up with Fender strings and it only took me about two minutes to get it tuned. It sounds so rich and sweet that I fell in love with it immediately. I have never played on any guitars that are more expensive than this one but I refuse to believe that they can sound or feel any better than this one does. I honestly have to say that in MY opinion, this is the BEST guitar you can get in this price range and I would even take the risk of saying it is better than guitars in a higher price range. If you are like me and you are reading this message to help you decide on which guitar you should purchase, take it from me.......... THIS IS THE ONE!"],["This guitar is amazing and better than I thought it would be, especially for the looow price. It is perfect. It is as described, YES it is an authentic FENDER guitar, and YES, it comes with a hardshell case, which is very nice. I feel confident that my guitar is protected when I travel. The case is fake-leather black, and fur-lined on the inside. I DID buy this on Amazon from this page from Austin Bazaar, but on a different account (just want to explain why it doesn't have an \"Amazon Verified Purchase\" thing). The sound is very high quality, although you may not think so upon opening. That's because the guitar is way out of tune (not that I expected it to be in tune). I tuned it up in about 20 minutes using an online tuner since I have a microphone on my laptop (just making a suggestion here). Once it's tuned up, it sounds SUPERB. The finish is beautiful; the picture just doesn't do justice. It is sunburst with a gloss coating on front and back. Another reviewer said they got the wrong color, which sucks, cause this is absolutely gorgeous. I got the right color, so I'm happy :) Anyways the STEEL strings don't hurt, unless you're an absolute beginner. I bring this up because I've been playing on a nylon guitar which has an INCREDIBLY different sound, so granted I wasn't used to this authentic guitar sound. It took me a little time to warm up to it, but when I did I was IN LOVE. It has an amazing sound. Another reviewer said the sound was a bit \"bright\" and I guess it is, but I assure you it is still very, very pleasing. The size is perfect for me (I am a 15 year old girl).The package came with just the guitar and case, no extra parts - nothing. But I'm totally okay with that; not sure I'd handle repairs myself anyways. Not to advertise, but I reccomend you get the picks that appear in the \"customers also bought...\" section. I believe they're called Fender preimum picks or something? Well they're very impressive looking and comfortable. I got the Ocean turquoise.The one drawback I wanted to state was the guitar (at least the one I got) came with a sticker on the body itself, which honestly, pissed me off. Who puts a sticker on a brand new guitar? It was a sticker just advertising one of the guitar's features. Stupid me wanted it off, so I tried to pick/scrape it off. It took half an hour to scrub the top off. This DID do damage. I then used Goo Gone to take the remaining resdiue off. DON'T DO THIS. It faded the dark black color on the black thing under the sound hole (don't know technical name for that?) and tore some holes in the laminate finish. It is noticeable so I'm pretty bummed about that, but I'm not gonna let it bother me that much. Not deducting stars for this, but it'd be nice to know this so I could have handled it better (although on the flipside, I don't know why they'd tell me there is a sticker on it?) Basically, I'm just saying if you're guitar comes with a sticker BE CAREFUL UPON REMOVING IT.All in all, THIS GUITAR IS AMAZING. I see there only a few left so GET IT NOW, or you'll probably regret it! It's my second guitar and I am very, very happy with this purchase. The transaction was free of problems and it shipped here very fast!! Don't let the sticker thing change you're mind. That was just me being dumb, but giving you heads up. I LOVE MY FENDER CD-60 DREADNOUGHT ACOUSTIC, SUNBURST GUITAR!"],["I ordered the Sunburst finish guitar. The pictures really don't do it justice. Color is deep and rich on the front. The back is a very nice stained wood finish. The sound hole has a small mother of pearl inlay around it which looks nice. It came with a fake leather hard case which seems very sturdy. The case is lined with a black velvety type material. It also has a small compartment located where the thin part of the guitar neck lays, which included an extra bridge, bride pin and truss rod tuning wrench.Aside from tuning the strings, I didn't need to adjust the guitar at all. Plays with easy action and sounds terrific! Very happy with my purchase!"],["No one can believe what we paid for this guitar, I have people offering to buy it from me.  I just send them this link on Amazon.My daughter loved her birthday gift! :)  The case is amazing too."],["I was learning to play on my wife's 1970's era, low end guitar that had lived in our basement, untouched for years.  I decided to purchase something new at a reasonable price.  I researched several models in the $200 price range. I chose the Fender CD-60 based on the positive reviews and that a sturdy case was included.I searched for the guitar on Amazon and several vendors offered this model.  One, Sam Ash, who I had never heard of (I'm just getting back into music after many years) offered this model at just below $150.  I jumped on that price!The guitar arrived within two or three days with standard shipping.  I opened the box and found a case like hard-sided luggage, very impressive for a instrument at this price point.  The guitar is beautiful, well made, and sounds great.  A huge improvement over what I was using.  I'm really happy with my choice.I've only been playing it for a few days, so I can't comment on it's durability over time, but based on the reviews I read I hope to enjoy this guitar for a long time.I found the below review/web site really helpful in my selection:[...]Good luck with your search! - Patrick"],["I'm really really impressed with the quality of the case and guitar for this price.  Terrific for a beginner.  Color of the spruce top is much warmer, more golden, than the picture on amazon indicated.  I expected a more natural looking top - but am not disappointed for the price.  Tuned up great and will work well for our church youth group."],["All I can really say is WOW! This guitar is amazing, the sound is great as it is a Dreadnought, deep tone. It stays in tune quite well too. I just bought this at a music store. I previously bought a guitar from Amazon and it was horrible. I WOULD NOT recommend a purchase from them guitar wise, no sir. When you buy a guitar I believe it is best to be able to hold it, feel what it is like to strum it and play it. You can't skip this part if you plan to buy a guitar. There were two things that sold this to me, one was the fact that this guitar is very well made and stylish, just looking at it in the store made me smile from ear-to-ear. This is a great quality guitar that will outlast you. The second seller for me was the faux-leather case. Crafted beautifully and my guitar fits snugly inside, and I know that whatever happens my guitar will be safe in the hard case. I am sending my Amazon.com guitar back and keeping the one I just purchased, I would recommend buying this from a store, where the price is the same and there isn't any shipping cost. Another reviewer mentioned the color was different than the picture, I had the same problem, that and the guitar didn't look much like the one that I thought I bought, the one that was sent to me I could have bought $30 cheaper, so I am very infuriated about that. so, I would say be cautious about purchasing a guitar from here, it may not be what you really want. This is a fantastic guitar though, and I would buy it 10 more times without hesitation."],["This is a really great sounding guitar for the price. Has a nice warm sound to it.

I love how the tuner comes on WITHOUT having a jack in it, unlike my Ibanez TCY-10e. This guitar sounds amazing and I am not that good at playing and I have been getting tons of compliments on the looks and sound of this guitar. It has a more full sound than a smaller bodied guitar because it is a little bit bigger. I also use medium - thick strings on it.BEST THING EVER:I have bad joints especially my right shoulder and I had to quit a while back. My Ibanez and this guitar is very comfortable.

A few things: 1) the tuner and electronics are Fishman, but they're different from the picture.  There are very small knobs to turn for bass, mid, and high instead of the sliders.  It's very hard to see the position in low stage lighting.  The tuner is more of a round display with red and green indicator lights.  I like it better.  Also, the battery compartment is located separately on the end of the guitar along with the jack.  Not a bad design, actually.  2) the bridge pins are not black with white dots, but white with black dots.  No big deal.  3) Fender advertises EXP 11's for strings.  It came with a non-coated set of 12's.  I changed the strings to Elixir 11's and it's much better.  I think I'll play through this set of strings and then have the bridge shaved a little to lower the action.  It's a little higher than I like.  On the plus side, the finish and look of the guitar are first-rate and it really stays in tune.  I've received nothing but complements on it and it's unique - so far nobody else in my area has one! I was surprised to see a \"made in China\" sticker in the soundhole, but it's really a quality guitar with a great sound, not too bright and not too muddy.  Really shines through an amp, too.  I wasn't expecting a great acoustic electric under $300, but this one easily takes on others twice the price.  Recommended."],["the sound is amazing! it also has a tuner built in which is very handy. I so happy i spend $300.00 on it, in stead of $600.00 from fenders website!"],["i am a begginer at guitar and bought this guitar sight unseen after reading reviews for about a year.  the price seems right for what it is.  now that i have been playing for 6 months and have also played several other concert sized acoustic electrics which  cost more, it really rivals more expensive guitars.  the Hellcat has a edgy raw sound to it but i think that is what you are going for with this instrument.  I dont think you will be dissapointed."],["I bought this guitar in my third attempt to learn how to play, so I'm definitely no expert here. However, I love the sound of this guitar.

I'm not crazy about the hellcats on the neck, but it's the sound that counts and for the money, you're getting a nice guitar.I know some people are saying \"but it isn't as good as my buddies 2k dollar martin, so it can't be a five!\" Well, I gave it a five because it's a five, in it's price range."],["Even though this instrument is chinese, it's perfect.It's sound can rival more expensive acoustic guitars, i recomend it to everyone.This guitar made me wanna improve my technique."],["Ok, so this was kind of a Birthday gift to myself.

I haven't used the electric part yet (just got it a hour ago) but the acoustic is amazing. It's replacing my previous guitar, a Washburn D100B. The Washburn was my first real guitar and now I have my Fender. This thing has a great sound, the strings that came on it are okay for now. It plays really well but I plan on getting some better strings later. No rush to get strings though because it still sounds great. No buzz when I play and within the hour that I have had it, I have had no problems. Oh, and it came with a nice hellcat guitar strap. It also came with one of those little L shaped adjusting rods.

I think that rule of thumb is safely broken with these Mustang amps. I originally wanted the MIII for its extra features but the number of reports still appearing online about the tail-end fizz concerned me. I didn't want to deal with that in any way, shape or form. Since I didn't  really need the power of the III (I'm not gigging) I reasoned that for my needs (practice and recording at home) I would probably end up with a laptop attached to the thing anyway most of the time, which has a much better UI than even the III's small LCD can provide. I should add that a laptop or PC is only needed for \"deep\" editing of the 24 preset tones. You don't need it at all to play or even for \"tweaking\" a tone, which can be done easily from the amp's control panel.I don't regret my decision. The MII is an excellent practice amp and I'm just getting started customizing it through the FUSE software. It seems to be the perfect match to my Squier Classic Vibe 60's strat, which itself is an amazingly good product (with no need to qualify that with \"for the money\").

It is $200 worth of sound and fun. I have tweaked every preset and am still experimenting. The Line 6 Syder 30 that I used to take to lessons and small jams is just sitting there."],["Very nice amp.. Lots of gagets to mess with on the PC..Lots of fun..Very clean when you want it to be.The four stars is because 40 watts transistor is not as loud as my 5 watt Blackstar tube amp.But am keeping it for practice and recording."],["After reading reviews and watching several online demos, I was convinced this amp was worth a try. Considering I do at least 85% of my playing while 3 kids are sleeping in the house, I wanted something that sounded good at low volumes and ideally through headphones as well. I am a compulsive tinkerer on my PC, so the USB-powered Fuse was icing on the cake for me.First the bad: My initial impression when unboxing the amp was that it felt a bit cheap and toy-like. The knobs look and feel fragile and the black covering looks cheap with obvious seams visible. The light weight makes it feel as if it may break if I sit or stand on it. The jacks (including main input) are clad in black plastic instead of metal. Most of the presets didn't seem very usable out of the box as they were too \"processed\" for my taste. Too much compression, reverb, etc. The Bassman and Twin Reverb were exceptions and I found them usable without much tweaking.Now the good: I have played through a variety of modeling amps/software from the roland cube to amplitube and some of the iphone/ipad stuff. This is by far the best sound I have heard from something that does not have tubes in it. The ability to run my ipod directly into the amp with backing tracks is a huge benefit. I find the amp great for hassle-free recording as well (with surprisingly good results). It is really fun to tweak and create various sounds using the Fuse software. I plan on using this amp as my ONLY amp for playing at home. I'll keep the micro cube for when I need to be on batteries, but that's about it.A few final notes: Make sure to update the firmware as there have been improvements and this will possibly improve sound if you have an earlier build (did on mine). One word of caution - my glowing review is from someone who plays blues, funk, and vintage tones almost exclusively. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this for metal or more aggressive styles. For all this does, it is money well spent and provides a great-sounding practice amp at all volumes (and through headphones). Don't forget to download other users' presets and additional fender presets.

Warranty period was only one year. The Mustang has a 5 year warranty, and has performed flawlessly so far. Everyone says the Mustang sounds far better than the Line 6, and I'm very satisfied with it"],["Not as fun as the Mustang 3 (which I also own), but a great amp for the money. Plenty of volume."],["im not a profesional player but i like to play once in a while just for fun and this sound great."],["I bought this amp to play my guitar in a jazz trio-guitar, piano, violin.  When I listened to the amp by itself, it sounded fine, other than most of the amp settings have oodles of fuzz in them which doesn't really work with jazz.  O.K., I found a couple settings (twin reverb, e.g.) that sounded clean enough...but when playing with the other two instruments, the bass response of the Mustang II is totally lost.  Make no mistake, you get a lot of goodies to play with, including the cool, but poorly documented FUSE software (hack around, you can make it work).  I'd suggest this amp for someone who is starting to play and wants to get a feeling for what effects (chorus, flange, etc.) they like; what kind of reverb (hall, room, etc.), if they like a modelling amp, etc.etc.  But I think you'll be very disappointed in the tone if you play even at very moderate volume levels with others....it is a very \"bright\" amp-you hear the high tones well-too well, really, but you might as well not have that low E string on your guitar.  Maybe they really meant this amp to be used with electric ukuleles.:>}UPDATE:  After using the FUSE software for awhile, I found out that you can have better bass response and a cleaner sound than those awful presets that come with the amp...as one reviewer noted, the first thing to do is to get rid of the presets, hook up the FUSE software to your amp and choose some presets to replace the factory presets that work for your kind of music, in my case, jazz.  Don't just pick a factory preset that you figure is \"good enough\", like I did before I wrote the original review...there really are a bundle of good presets that I  figure were developed by teenagers that can't read music or tab, but have great ears.:>} (just jealous).Here's a quick guide to the FUSE software:1.After the software has been loaded from the disc, you will have to register-hit \"logon\" and follow instructions.2.  Now to load a preset: go back to the FUSE software (a picture of an amp with oodles of hyperlinks should be on the screen).  IGNORE all the hyperlinks except the one on the right that says Media Library.  Click on that link-you are now there!3.On the middle of the screen there are the words (hyperlinks)  \"Computer Amp  Web\". Click on Web and a very long list of presets will appear-pick one that looks good to you and RIGHT CLICK on it-it will say Download Preset-click on that.  Your guitar is connected to your computer with the USB chord and the amp is on, right?  Also make sure the PRESET knob is turned so you see a red or green light-if the light is amber, turn the knob until you have a red or green selection.4. Plug in your guitar and play the preset you just selected from the Web menu and see if you like it-if not, go to Media Library, pick another one, RIGHT CLICK and download...ah, that's the one? On your amp, press SAVE-it will start to blink; press SAVE again-the preset has now replaced one of the aforementioned awful factory presets on your amp.5.  Turn the Preset knob to another red or green position (so you don't over-write the preset you just saved), go back to the Media Library and repeat the process until you've replaced all the red and green presets you want to; you can always over-write any preset later that you decide wasn't all that good after all.I thought I'd toss these brief instructions in because the manual instructions are, well, manual instructions....you have to hack around a bit to get the idea. Hope these hints were of help.

TOTAL PAID $174.99 bleeding great BARGAIN."],["Reviewing the Fender Mustang II can be tricky. Different people can and will have different needs and expectations. My rating (actually closer to 3.5 stars) is based on how versatile the Mustang II is for how much it costs and how good it sounds at its price-point. The rest of my observations are intended to provide insights you won't get from Fender's specs and Amazon's product description.Let's start with sound quality: As you'd expect, the Mustang II excels at Fender clean tones, but even the heavily distorted or overdriven tones are surprisingly good. The in-between/at-the-edge-of-breakup tones, however, are hit-and-miss. It may be possible to dial in the type of touch-sensitive distortion you'd get with a Vox AC-15 for example, but if there is, I haven't found it.Aside from this, keep in mind that the tone you're looking for probably won't be dialed into one of the out-of-the-box presets. In fact, the odds are low. The default presets seem designed more for showing off the amp's versatility in a guitar store than for actual performance. If you're looking for a particular tone setting you'll either have to use the dials on the amp to adjust the preset to your liking (turn off reverb, increase bass, reduce treble, for example), then save your settings, or you'll have to use Fender's Fuse software to do the tweaking online and download your new settings to the amp.The good news is that Fuse allows you a lot more amp and effects choices than are available on the amp alone, even amps such as the 65 Princeton Reverb, which are not among the standard presets printed on the Mustang II's selector dial. The bad news is that even when you overwrite one of the presets, the name printed on the amp stays the same. That means you have to remember that \"65 Twin Reverb\" in preset bank one may  actually be a \"65 Princeton\" and might be something completely different in preset bank two. (This is where an amp such as the Mustang III, which has an LCD that displays the actual preset name, comes in handy.) With Fuse you can overwrite any of the presets. With the amp alone you can overwrite only the presets in the 2nd (green) and 3rd (red) banks.The same applies to the effects presets: You can use Fuse to change or adjust them, but unless you write your changes down it or assign them to the preset dials in a logical way, it can be hard to remember exactly what they are once you're not connected to Fuse. Effects adjustments are possible only in Fuse. Once you save the effect to the amp, it's a preset that is either on or off, meaning you can't adjust it at all. Want more or less reverb or delay? You gotta fire up Fuse, make the adjustments there, and save them to the amp. The only way to adjust effects in real-time is to have a computer running Fuse connected to the amp.Whether its amp tones or effects, you're always working with presets. With the exception of Master Volume, whatever you program into the amp has no direct  relationship to the physical dial settings. You can use the dials to alter the preset, but unless you save the new settings, the amp will revert to the last-saved preset when you turn the amp off and back on.As for Fuse itself, I did not find it to be the most user-friendly software. It is a web application that takes up several GB of hard drive space, requires a support application from Microsoft (Silverlight), runs in a limited number of browsers, is poorly documented, runs slowly on some computers, and is far from intuitive. It took me a couple of hours reading the manuals, looking at online tutorials and surfing the Web before I could figure it out.None of this is a deal-breaker if you're willing to invest a few hours into dialing in a few presets that produce the tones you're looking for and saving them to the amp. It could be a drag if you need to choose and adjust many settings quickly and without a computer.Another limitation is maximum volume. You might think that at 40W the Mustang II would be pretty loud. In fact, although it's loud enough for practice at home or rehearsing at moderate volumes, it's nowhere near as loud as a tube amp with the same wattage would be. In fact, my 18W Fender Champ II is a noticeably louder and a more dynamic (less compressed). If you're looking for something that can keep up with a loud drummer without having to be miked through a PA, you had best consider the Mustang III or IV.A final benefit is that the Mustang II sounds and plays like a tube amp without any of the drawbacks of tube amps, such as variations in tube quality, the need to replace tubes, weight, heat, and so on. The bottom line here is that as long as its limitations and minor inconveniences don't cramp your style, the Mustang II is a versatile, great sounding, reasonably reliable amp at a hell of a good price. You could do a lot worse."],["First of all, I'm new to playing the guitar and this is my first amplifier so I have nothing to personally compare it to.  Having said that, this thing is a blast to use.  I've downloaded all kinds of presets with the Fuse software and created a few of my own.  I use the software all the time and it's really easy to get used to if you're a little tech savvy.  Best way to learn is just play with the software, which is what I did.  And for 40 watts this thing is loud!  I got mine on sale for $169, which is a killer bargain for what you get with this amplifier."],["I play as a hobby and don't need a huge amp.  That being said, this amp sounds great and is perfect for what I do.  You just cant beat having all those effects built in!  The amp is plenty loud and the metal type distortion i use a lot sounds great on this amp (sounds great clean to if you were planning on playing it that way)."],["for its price it has awesome sounds IMHO. The presets are somehow loud or not quite nice, but  with some adjustments you will get an incredible set of sounds. I got rid of all the metal amps  i dont use and built a beautiful set of amps and effects. If you have the patience to enter the mind blowing fender fuse and tweak every amP, and then select the best 2 or 3, just the very best sweet sounds that make you feel THAT.YOUR VERY PERSONAL TASTE WILL CHOOSE BETWEEN MORE THAN  A DOZEN INCREDIBLE AMPS.

THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH MY INSTRUMENTS EVERYTIME THEY ARRIVE, EVEN WHEN RETURNED FOR HAVING ISSUES."],["I can't say enough about how impressed I am with this amplifier.  Fender has really packed a load of usable features into an affordable, excellent sounding package.  I've had the amp for two weeks now and am still exploring all of its capabilities, but it's one of the most exciting guitar products to come my way in years.First of all, the different amp presets sound absolutely killer and the included FUSE software allows for easy editing and you can store an unlimited number of presets on your computer.  There are many amp models and effects to choose from and the FUSE interface is so simple even an old school knob twirler like myself can handle it.  Using the computer, you can replace the factory presets on the amp with your own, making it a truly custom amplifier.Secondly, I was really impressed with the sound I can get from the amplifier.  I have always preferred tube to solid state and this is the first modeling amp I've really been impressed with.  It just sounds fantastic, with real differences between the various amp models you can choose from.  It's been a real treat to be able to explore the different models, such as the Bassman, the Deluxe, Princeton, Twin, and other Fender and non-Fender amplifiers.  The 12\" speaker sounds great and the forty watts provides plenty of power, at least for my purposes.Lastly, Fender has outdone themselves with the options they include.  The amp features an input for your audio/MP3 player-great for those of us who like to practice along with music, a headphone output that doubles as a speaker emulator for recording, and a USB connection for connecting to the FUSE software and recording software.  Fender has also included free recording software (Ableton) and their Amplitube software (as seen on the most recent iPad commercial).  And you get all of this for two hundred bones.  Well done, Fender!If you're interested in this amplifier, do yourself a favor and check out the demo video on Fender's website.  It's a really nice overview of the features and they also have sound samples of some of the presets you can listen to.  The amp sounds just as good in person.(The Mustang I is a 20 watt amp with an 8\" speaker, but has all of the same goodies as the II if you don't need the power and want to save a hundred bucks.)"],["Starting off,I'm 13 and I've been playing guitar for 8 months now. I got this for my birthday 3 months ago (February). Let me say I've had 2 amps before this one, and this one blows the other 2 away! It has 3 banks of presets with 8 in each bank. Each preset based off of other Fender and even Non-Fender amp models. You can customize the presets to your liking, and I enjoy being able to customize things to how I want them. The tones are absolutely great! It comes with software that I wasn't able to figure out but even still, the amp is great on its own. Heres the pro's and cons to wrap it up:Pros:Loudcan be very quiet when neededJack for hooking up an Ipod to play along with your musicJack for an ordinary pair of earbuds/headphones (instead of stereo phones)Various range of effects and tonesCons:Nothing!!!Ending statement: This is an amazing amp all around and you should buy it if you have the money!!!"],["My review(s) for this have changed a few times, but no more. When I first got it I liked the sound, though it did sound a little cold and digital, and this is from someone wanting to record shoegaze/dreampop, which by it's nature is full of cold tones (reverb/chorus/delay) shimmering, a la cocteau twins, chapterhouse, lush, so at first I thought it was great. Then the fuse software was even cooler, all this customizing the sound, though it did sound noisy and needed the compressor to take some of the noise away.After all of that I finally realized I was trying to ignore the fizz/crackle/hair, it's called a few things. Go to the fender forums and look it up, or search it on yahoo/google.The thing happening with this amp I think is a few things. Fender guitars sound best through it, which is silly if you don't own a fender, and I don't and refuse to get a squire as that body is so played out, I wanted ANYTHING but a strat body, unless I have a grand to pay for an older one, I'm not going to get a rinky dink one, and I would only get one after I got like 5 other dream guitars first.so everyone has different problems with pickup quality and guitar quality. Also, playing into a modeling amp is like playing into a computer, that may be fine for some (younger folks), but to a lot of people I've read the complaints I was trying not to realize, as I didn't feel like having to pay for shipping to return it, BUT I DID!And I am so glad I did. I almost got a peavey vypyr, and I am glad I didn't. This amp, to be fair, is really close to being really cool, but that sound problem, which I read on fender's own forum/website, FENDER ACKNOWLEDGES IT EXISTS, BUT DOES NOTHING TO FIX IT IN FUTURE MODELS!! sorry, but that's some big company b.s.I've been reading of people saying it sounds cold and lifeless and all that and tube this and tube that, and I was like \"what music snobs\" and what have you. But I realized that I'm a music snob! I love the music I listen to more than anything, and feel like the music I create should have a life to it as well. So I returned the mustang 2 and ALMOST got a marshall mg 30 watt, cause I wanted an amp with a clean sound that didn't have that crackle sound, but THANKFULLY I caught myself before that return, as after that, it would have been final.The decision I did make I think will be great for me, as I'd rather start with a good real tone, then get the effects I need. I kept reading reviews of these teenagers that hadn't played for more than a year or two or so saying \"throw away your pedals, you won't need them\" and \"I was going to get pedals, but don't need to now\", that's kind of the danger of these amps, they end up making everyone sound the same! No matter what tweaking I was doing on the mustang, it sounded the same but in a different costume.I think this amp and modeling amps are best for beginning guitarists and I've seen some old timers getting an amp for home use after years, maybe that's for them, but I needed something to record with and practice and get the best, most real tone possible, so that means tube amp.I think if I played this at a GC I wouldn't of gotten it, and I just tried to make myself like it."],["Note: I bought mine used and it didn't have the USB cable, so I haven't tried the included FUSE software.With this amp, you get 24 storeable presets across the 8 amp models. This lets you set volume, EQ, distortion, and effects including reverb. There is a master volume which does not affect your presets. It only makes the amp louder or softer. FUSE lets you upload, edit, store and share your presets with other FUSE users.You have several knobs and jacks on the amp's interface. Looking down at the amp and starting from the left going right, you have two, 1/4\" jacks for your cable and and footswitch (Not included). Then there's Gain, Volume (For your presets), Treble, Bass (No Mid switch), and Master (i.e. your master volume).Then you have your preset knob. This scrolls through 8 amp models with 3 preset banks each. When you edit a preset via FUSE or your amp by tweaking the knobs, the \"Save\" button to the right of your Preset knob lights up. Double-tap it to save your preset. The Exit button will ignore saving the preset. The Mod knob scrolls through several effects, arranged in A-D regions. Each region is a slew of effects, not just one. FUSE can download more effects into your Mustang II. Your amp will probably have factory default presets, so you can scroll through with the Preset knob and try the different amp models and effects out.Next is the Dly/Rev knob, for delay and reverb settings, respectively. Finally there is the Tap button, allowing you to tap-tempo your delay. Hold the Tap button for the on-board tuner. The tuner's key indicators are along the LEDs for your amp model presets.Your final set of jacks include a mini-USB port, necessitating Fender's included (If bought new or the prev. owner didn't lose it) USB cable, a 1/8\" headphone jack, and a 1/8\" aux port, presumably for MP3 players and Ipods. Next to them is the power switch.Advantages: this amp is easy to use, with each bank of presets being a different color (Green, orange and red). This is great for neophytes wary of digital amps. Just scroll around to find what you like, and save it to one of 24 presets. Use FUSE to download and edit more presets. Using this amp the first few times, you will spend a lot of time scrolling through the amp models and effects just for fun and experimentation.Disadvantages: effect controls are limited. You can't set the depth, range and gain on most of the effects on board. You either need FUSE to do it or you're stuck with what's saved on the amp. There is no midrange option on the EQ. If you don't have the USB cable, it can be tough finding a replacement. A footswitch is a needed accessory if you ever want to use this with a band or at a gig.Tones: The '57 Deluxe, '58 Bassman and '65 Twin Reverb are the best-sounding models on the Mustang. This makes sense since they are all Fender products and are considered Fender's signature amps. They get a tube-like break up at higher volume, but none get very distorted. There is no noticeable clipping or hiss associated with solid state or digital amps, like Line 6. They clean up well and are touch-responsive. Play hard and they start to break up; play quiet, and they shimmer and back off. The British 60s setting is terrible. It's unclear what amp Fender was trying to imitate, but it doesn't do a good job here at any gain, volume or EQ setting. If you like dirty, gritty and off-kilter tones a la Black Keys and White Stripes though, you might like the British 60s sound.Moving forward, the British 80s is supposed to clone a JCM800. It gets in the neighborhood in terms of trebly gain and aggressiveness, but it does lack the tube warmth. It does, however, have some touch responsiveness, which is a good thing for a digital amp at this price point. The American 90s approximates a Mesa/Boogie rectifier amp, and it does an average impression of such an amp, if not totally perfect. It's a decent high gain setting nonetheless, but note master volume counts with this one. At quieter levels the American 90s model sounds mushy and uninspired. Next is the Metal 2000, which may be an homage to the Bogner Uberschall and other high-gain boutiques. It too should have higher volume to sound proper, but some might not like it, and think more of the DOD Death Metal distortion pedal than a $2000 amp. Finally there's the Super-sonic model, a sort of medium-to-high gain model with a lot of midrange. It dials in a decent tone with enough tweaking, but it's nothing special. Overall the Fender clone models rank the best, the American 90s second, the others in the middle, and the British 60s dead last in terms of tone.Conclusion: if you do not like digital amps as a rule, the Mustang II will not change your mind. If you want a budget-friendly practice amp with options for play and experimentation, then the Mustang II is quite a value, because of its dynamic expression on some models, ability to store and edit presets from your computer, and low price. If you are a beginner, the Mustang does better Fender-style modeling than the Line 6 Spyder and Peavey Vypyr, but their higher gain settings might be superior. For working musicians, consider something else from Fender, like the Hot Rod series or possibly the Machete over this decent, but at times uneven amplifier."],["Fender Mustang II Electric Guitar AmplifierThe Fender Mustang II AMPLIFIER is SMARTLY DESIGNED, near perfection.

He plays quite a bit and just got to play a week ago at the famed Rhyman Auditorium.  A great experience for him and the acoustics were fabulous!!  Thanks so much for such great service and a great product."],["As far as amps that model vintage tones.  This is the best.For my ear, Line 6, Vox, Crate, Digitech etc are nowhere near the Fender Mustang if you are comparing Vintage tones.I have played amps and effects from many companies, as well as many of the 'hybrid amps' that combine tube and digital tones, and if you are looking for the best recreation of Vintage Blues, Rock, Hard Rock, Country tones... the type of tones that you get from some of the famed Fender amps, the Mustang Series is as good as you are going to do.I originally bought the Mustang I for my 9 year old son to be his first practice amp and when we hooked it up for him, I could hardly let him play.The tone editing is easy through the controls on the amp.  It is easy and straight forward to see what you need to do to tweak your sound just by turning knobs.  When you add the Fender FUSE to the mix and start to download new tones from the web and tweak it with dozens of stomp boxes and effects that are free to play with and try and keep on your amp this is an amazing value. (not to even mention the Ableton recording software that comes for free with the amp.)The reason I love this amp is because of the faithful recreation of the great Fender amps like the Bassman, Deluxe Reverb, and Twin Reverb.  I have never heard a digital sound replicate tube amps even close to this well.I have heard several people say that they would never buy this amp because it is not a tube amp or because they are not computer savvy.For the Tube amp snobs...Nothing is going to match the sound of a really great Fender Tube amp.  But if you want to recreate great fender amps at low volumes the Mustang will be a great practice amp for you. OR... if you want to bring an amp to practice that weighs a fraction of what your Fender Tube amps weighs, the mustang is a great choice.  I am selling my only tube amp now that I have the Mustang II because I don't gig and really need an amp that I can practice with at night while the kids are in bed.For the Non-Computer folk...There is plenty to keep you occupied on this amp without ever plugging it into a computer.  And if you want to give it a try, it couldn't be easier to download new sounds and tweak your favorite tones.For the Metalheads...This amp probably is not for you.  Go try and buy a higher gain Line 6 or the Vox ADT series of hybrid amps to get some really heavy tones.  There are some decent metal tones to download on the FUSE, but the real strength of this amp is Vintage tones.Let me make it clear!  I played my son's Squier Mini guitar through this amp and it sounds really amazing.  I have a Fender Strat, Squier Tele and a Les Paul and they all sound amazing in this amp.This is the first piece of guitar equipment that has given me absolutely NO buyers remorse.  Unbeatable value.  A great toy.  A perfect practice tool.  You can't beat it."],["Well, just got it, plugged in and here are some initial impressions.1. Pretty much what I expected - much more \"relaxed\" at higher volumes than the M1.2. Definitely much bigger and fuller sounding with its commensurate drawbacks.- slightly less naturally sparkly compared to the M1- will have to reduce the mids a bit via the Fuse editor.- although it has less overall sparkle, that also translates to smoother highs. I was actually a bit hard pressed to get it to sound buzzy. This is of course via the front panel only. I'm sure it can be done using the Fuse editor.3. It's supposed to be 7 lbs. heavier than the M1 but it sure doesn't feel like it. I keep looking at the M1 fiendishly wondering if there's a way to shoehorn a 12\" speaker in there.4. For the most part, the patches created in the M1 translated pretty well after the required firmware update, needing just a few adjustments here and there.5. I'm appreciative of the fuller more naturally extended low end as I won't have to crank the bass control as much as I have to on the M1. That of course translates to more headroom for the power amp.More from editing via Fuse - here are a few of the things that I found and liked.- The 65 Deluxe model sounds better with the 57 Deluxe's Cab and vice versa. The 65 has more headroom and works great as a clean spanky amp with the 57's cab while the 57 model's propensity to break up sooner works better with the 65's less sparkly cab. The 57 also seems to have more low end girth.- The Twin is a bit too icepick-y sometimes and it seems to pair better with the Bassman's cab.- The SuperSonic's Cab is a bit more muted at the top end than any of the other cabs and works well for sounds I use that have a bit more gain. It's good for keeping things from getting too buzzy. It's a very fat sounding Cab sim.- Both the M1 and 2 seem to respond really well with my Tex-Mex pickups. I have not played a guitar with regular sized humbuckers on these amps yet (my other guitar has mini humbuckers) but somehow I get the feeling that I won't like it as much as I do with the strat. I think this is understandable though. Since Fender has always been all about the single coils, I'm not surprised that the impedance relationship between these amps and my strat feels so spot on.So far, for 200 bucks... I couldn't ask for more."],["I passed on all the Fender G-Dec units for years,(still glad I did), instead buying the Line 6 Spyder Jam and then a Line 6 Spyder IV. They are both great amps for sure, but for the money, Fender has really got this one right.  The clean tones on this are just great. The ability to modify with FUSE is an additional layer of gravy.  The amp is just about perfect for bedroom, studio or practice. I bet more than a few of these quietly show up in Nashville studios...I still love my Line 6 units, especially my Spyder Jam cause I can play along with tracks, and I love the accuracy of the models in the Line 6 Spyder IV.  But if you are in the market for a great practice amp, or an amp that will take you from super clean to vintage dirty for special effects on a demo, Fender hits the mark on this one. It's just ridiculous what is in this for $199.I compared this to a VOX Valve modeling amp, not even a contest. Against a Spyder IV, individual tastes will vary.Only complaint is the \"stacking\" of the six effects onto just two knobs. But that is a minor complaint. Most people don't use chorus and flange at the same time anyway.If you are in the market for a cheap, reliable modeling amp that is less cost than a Digitec RP500 pedal, you owe yourself to look at this thing. Right now, it is the biggest bang for the buck.

My understanding is that the mustang iii does, so maybe it is worth the $100 investment to save $18 on the foot switch.Pros:  The effects are great.  A pretty decent chorus and flanger are really nice for rocking out to Smashing Pumpkins like I do.  Good clean sound on this amp is really nice too.  I went to youtube and put in fender mustang ii amp and found a video that shows a guy playing all the different presets.

If you are just starting out, for heaven sake don't buy the squire make me a rockband rockstar kit, and they guitars sound horrible.

I am a PRS guitars fan, and usually by being fan of a 'brand' you tend to incline towards their products. But this time I felt different, I have had a cyber deluxe digi/analog amp for about 8 years now, and everytime I kick that thing on, it blows me away, but more importantly, the people that hear it for the first time. Because I've had this amp, I hardly used any effects pedal with it. I always thought that it couldn't get better, until the mustang came along, it works nicely with the amp, it is faithful to the Amp's sound, but it also has a soul of its own. It has a neat midi port which can come on handy when you want to diversify. It is easy to operate and you can lay tracks, jam, practice right out of the box, it sounds exceptional when used on recordings, the quality and response of the sound, the richness in tone and the pallete of sounds you can play this, makes this a 5 star.

After I got the Mustang Floor last month, it took me a while to customize the effects I liked (created some patches for rhythm, flllers, lead). The beauty of this board is that you can switch between various effects at the tap of your foot, far more efficient from an ergonomics and \"lack of mess\" perspective.My grouse at this point is the inability to daisy-chain more than one stomp box effect for one patch/preset (or more than one modulation effect for that matter). Luckily things like wah are possible either as stomp boxes or modulation boxes.I'm still playing with the board and will most likely post a more detailed review after a few months.I use the mustang floor via USB with my mac book pro + garageband, while the left + right phone jacks go into my tascam US-122 mk II USB interface.

The price is right, the tone is amazing, and ease of use is elementary for those who want to spend their time playing and not fiddling with 14,000 presets and options.I have owned almost every Multi-Effects processor available, and tonal wise this is the best Ive used. Please note, I run directly to the main board in our church sanctuary, so this is my opinion of the tone direct to the house. Having said that, I also have used it as a stompbox with my amps in private, and it has blown away every boutique pedal I have owned. I heard a man say, \"Fender, stick to guitars, not boards!\" People do not realize that when dealing with a multi effects board, you must do your homework and find the tone that works for you. It will take some time. I have over 2 grand in boutique pedals and I always come back to this pedalboard. Both direct to house and when in front of an amp its awesome! I play a very Joe Bonamassa style tone, and the Brit 80's tweaked is on spot everytime. People actually get mad when I show them how I get my tone. I lead worship with my wife, and play rythym/lead and sing.

If the actual tube amp is an oil painting and the amp's model is a photo, the Floor's model is a centerfold with a big crease and a couple staple holes in the middle.Don't get me wrong.  It's a great value.  One boutique pedal could cost as much.  And the balanced left & right outs are much better for direct recording than a mini phone jack. It's fine for most everything you want a Mustang to do. But it also sounds better through a different amp.  It doesn't really sound that great through another Mustang amp. You can dial up the cleanest Fender Twin and use it though a Mustang, but if you try to turn off the amp models on the Floor and use say the Metal 2000 on a Mustang it doesn't work right.

Since then it has seen about a dozen moving trucks, airline baggage checks, trips to the beach, rain forests, blizzards, its been rained on, frozen, baked in a hot summer car, and its even seen the stage a few times. This guitar holds its tune well even playing outside in the winter, it looks great and takes abuse like a champ. I am not notoriously kind to my instruments (if you arn't going to take it everywhere what's the point in learning to play) but this guitar is still going strong.It has the longest sustain of any guitar I have heard ever (almost annoyingly long), some strings have strange rattles if plucked too hard (I can't remember if it came like this or if I did something to it) The action was ridiculously high out of the box, but is easily adjustable. Expect to have to get a new gig bag after a year or so, the black canvas and foam liner are fine, but should not also be used as a suit case, the zipper will not hold.I have recently upgraded to another guitar, but this one remains continually loaned out to friends, family, children, anyone who wants to learn.It gets 4 stars instead of 5 because of the gig bag and its annoying zipper, the neck/head seem excessively long for some reason, and the action seems to need adjustment regularly without explanation as to why... once again its not hard to do, but its strange that it sneaks higher and higher every so often.

For a beginner's guitar, this one is definitely worth trying out.My only complaint would be that the bridge saddle and neck nut height is high.

After trying a classical guitar, and the drums, I didn't want to drop a bundle on yet another instrument that she might not use.  The pack came with the guitar, a gig bag, strings and an extra set, picks, and a tuner.The guitar itself gets 5 stars.  It's a solid instrument with a nice solid top that's sure to age into a rich, full tone.  I knew we wanted to get something that would only sound better with time, so a solid top was a priority.  The grain of the wood is beautiful, and just on appearance, this was the nicest looking guitar in the shop.  It didn't have that twangy sound that many of the others had, even the much more expensive Yamaha guitars.As for the items that it came with...well, the gig bag is very cheap, even for a soft sided gig bag.  It's more like a trash bag with handles.  Since we already had a hard case, I didn't care.  If you don't have another case or bag, get one, because the one that comes in the pack isn't going to protect the instrument from anything.The strings are fine, no complaints on the quality for a beginner or novice, but an advanced player would probably want to upgrade them.The tuner is crappola.  We already had a nice electric tuner, so again, this didn't matter to us, but if we didn't, I would have been fairly unhappy to see such a low quality tuner come out of the box.  I tried it out, and didn't have much luck.  There are much, much better tuners, even the non-electric ones would be better and they're fairly cheap to buy.Overall, this is a great instrument that's being marketed with substandard accessories to folks that know just enough about guitars to realize that the price is worth it, just for the guitar.  There's a cheaper Fender starter pack available (99 dollars), and I'm sure the accessories are exactly the same- main difference being the two pc. top.  It's worth the extra money for a solid top if you're buying this for an adult, or teenager, or want an instrument that will last.

It's not a $500 or $5000 guitar, this shouldn't surprise you. But for a first guitar, this isn't bad at all. Put some new strings on it and get it set up by a decent guitar shop and you'll be happy banging out that first year and longer.I bought mine locally, and had it set up kind of poorly initially. I can't stress enough having it set up by someone who knows what they are doing. It will be easier to play and sound better. I'll leave it at that. I gave away the tuner that was included and bought a Snark for $9. The gig bag is practically a nylon sack, but better than nothing. The strap is functional, barely... I a bought leather strap by Fender for $15 or so and put strap-locks on it after having the strap slip off the bottom end. But this is a standard design, not really a flaw. You'll eventually throw away or give away everything but the guitar and it's still a good deal. The accessories are good enough that you'll understand what and why you want to upgrade those things when you can. And that's okay, because the guitar is worth the $200 all by itself.Mine is made in China, but the frets ends are smooth all of the way up the neck even after a dry year in Denver. (Altitude and way too little humidity to make a guitar really happy.) With new strings, it stays in tune well enough that tuning it up once a day isn't always necessary. (And yes, I'm picky about it. When you're starting out, if you're not in tune you won't always know and that makes it a lot harder to learn.) The tone and volume of this guitar sound like I spent twice the money on it. It's no cannon, but I've made friends that play since getting it and I've received compliments on it's sound from people with experience. Playing it side by side with guitars at similar price points from Ibanez and Yamaha have been incredibly flattering to this guitar.Highly recommended."],["I really like the looks and sound of this guitar. Quailty made and a fair price. Everything was as picured and described. Everything you need to learn, tune and play the guitar is included. Great package. I'm very satisfied and would recommend this guitar."],["Over the years, I have owned and/or played and/or tweaked many high-end acoustic guitars (including my standby Ovation Adamas). I have also owned/played/hot-rodded many electrics. During this tenure, I have learned not to say one guitar \"sounds like\" another, although temptation arises in the case of the overachieving used Fender DG-8S I recently acquired to \"haul into the woods with a spiffy backpack gig bag\" (not the basic one included in the kit). The DG-8S' articulate tone is remarkably similar to several high-enders I have enjoyed.Calling the DG-8S a \"starter guitar\" is like calling a Boxster a \"starter Porsche\". While it's semantically-correct, it misses the point. The DG-8S stands on its own merits as a bona fide, high-quality, surprisingly well-built musical instrument. It is able to faithfully render the subtle nuances of my intricate finger style...not exactly the way a Martin or an Ovation does, but in a way that is wholesome, integral, and pleasing. It is, in other words, its own legitimate thing.Using a mirror to inspect the inner workings (build quality) of the DG-8S in comparison to a much more expensive dreadnought was a fascinating exercise. There is virtually nothing to fault in the DG-8S' construction. In a nutshell: high quality materials and excellent construction equal extraordinary value.Other reviewers have consistently pointed out two potential issues with an out-of-the-box DG-8S: string height and string buzz. Whether due to my playing technique or the previous owner's tweaks, my particular instance of this guitar evidenced no misbehavior. This isn't to say that other DG-8S guitars are immune from them. Here's the deal: if you're not a tweaker (and I submit the DG-8S is an inexpensive platform upon which to hone your tweaking chops), professional guitar techs are standing by to continually adjust your guitar(s) as it/they age(s) and/or misbehave(s). The expense of their services are warranted when the value (as measured by integrity, not dollar amount) of an instrument justifies it. I submit there is no doubt about the value proposition of professional set-up when it comes to the DG-8S. In addition, a good set of finger calluses and properly-strengthened hands help control the occasional, inevitable \"buzzes\" associated with any fretted instrument.Bottom line: this is a great guitar to start with, grow with, and use throughout your life.

As a result I am unable to make the &#34;reach&#34; on a standard bass but this short scale is excellent.  4&#34; shorter would not seem significant but it is.  As a result I am practicing several hours a day because it is enjoyable.  If you have small hands, short fingers, arthritis, or an injury- this bass not only sounds great but is a pleasure to play.  The tone and pickups are fine and it has a great bass &#34;feel&#34; and sound.  The only negative I've noticed is that the strings should be upgraded as they seem cheap...like the tires that come on a new car...ok and get the job done- but could be better.  Fit and finish are superb and although its a tad shorter in length it is a true bass and not a kids toy or kids bass."],["For $170, this is a great bass.  Made in Indonesia.  The P-pickup is clear and strong with a great P tone to it.  The J-pickup is a bit weaker and really won't stand on its own, but it's great at coloring the P-pickup, which is what I use it for.The neck is this axe's finest feature.  It is 1.5 inches wide at the nut and very thin.  It is arguably the fastest bass neck I have ever played.  The body of the guitar is Agathis, and this lends itself to a teeny bit of neck dive.  I don't even notice it with a leather strap but it's noticeable with a nylon strap.The tuners meet minimum requirements.  They hold tune but have a lot of backlash in the gears.  The Jag comes with a set of cheap roundwound strings that beg to be changed out.The final sanding of the wood body was hastily done.  If you look closely you can see a bit of waviness.  The finish is thin but attractive.Make no mistake; this is not a high-end bass, but it's a great starter bass or even a decent backup bass.  The fast neck makes it a delight to play and for this reason alone it is likely to see a lot of casual use by owners.  It's worth every penny of $170.One caution... This Jag is 43\" long so finding a gig bag that fits it nicely without being way too long is difficult.  Most guitar gig bags are too short and most bass gig bags are too long."],["I picked up this little jewel at a local music store (not a chain). I had been turned on to the Squier short-scale Jaguar bass by a rave review in Premier Guitar magazine almost two years ago, and it stayed in the back of my mind, even as I made other guitar purchases. Still, the desire for a short-scale bass remained. This modified Jaguar bass has more than met my expectations. It is not perfect, but what I did get for under $200 is impressive. A light body helps take off some of the strain that accompanies heavier four and five string basses. The short-scale neck facilitates much easier fret access, especially for fingers that have been playing for almost forty years. I learned to play on a short-scale bass, so there is a sense of familiarity inherent in playing the Jaguar. Although other reviews have mentioned flaws in the instrument's finish, I could detect no such problems. The pickups are not the greatest, but are more than serviceable when used with a bass effects unit, providing for a wide variety of tones. The set-up on mine was not that great: once I got it home, I wound up adjusting the neck and string heights to remove an annoying buzz in the upper frets. Once adjusted, though, playability was excellent.All in all, this one is a keeper. I do already have both a conventional four string bass, and a five string bass, but this little Jaguar bass is getting most of my \"bass love,\" at least for the time being. The reason why? It is just plain fun to play!For the money, you'll not find a better deal below $200!"],["This is the least expensive bass I have purchased, and also has turned out to be my favorite.  I was looking for a bass that weighed less than my Yamaha.  Not only is it light weight, but the action is great, and the tone is excellent.  I had always heard that Squier tuners were an issue; does not seem to be the case with this bass.  If you are looking for a short scale bass at a reasonable price, you should consider the Jaguar."],["This bass has nothing at all wrong with it, been playing it with Rocksmith and it is just perfect.  I love my bass it is one of the greatest purchases I have made. Definitely worth every penny."],["I am happy with my short scale bass guitar. The neck came as good as USA made guitars that I have bought. I am swapping the pickups out but for the price I am so happy. Very comfortable to play."],["A perfect guitar if you are an amateur  at bass playing. It is small, not that heavy, and looks cool!"],["I can't believe I found the inexpensive bass guitar I want. I wanted to play bass guitar for a long time but never look into it seriously. After a friend bought an expensive model (500$), full size, i tried it but my fingers won't make it (my friend also has trouble and can't play it as we both have smaller fingers).I look around and order this one, the 4 stars rating is not fair. I give it 5 for the performance / price ratio.It come in already setup, low action and good intonation. By the way, both of these are easy to adjust if you know how. I have setup a dozen of mandolins (which are much harder to do and to play). Plugging into my amp, adjust the knobs to get the volume and tone I like  and start playing, can't really put it down. That's all I can say about it. So easy on my fingers, sounds very good to my ears.One reviewer suggested which gigbag to buy from Amazon, so finding the right gigbag should not be an issue.I will not hesitate to use this bass on stage.'"],["Bought for a Christmas present and my boyfriend loved it! I would recommend buying! Deffiently is worth the money !!"],["I'm just learning to play bass as a hobby.  And at under $160, what...a...deal.  This is a slick candy red apple guitar with a high quality finish and quality material that will make you wonder why this guitar wasn't priced above $400.  I'm a short guy with short arms, so the short scale bass is exactly what the doctor ordered.  Because it's short scale, the gage of the wires are heavier in order to produce the same tonality, but I'm liking the extra resistance that the strings provide, urging me to pluck harder if I really want to emphasize notes and not having to exert much effort to keep a more dimunitive tone.I use this bass with Rocksmith on the Playstation 3 (with the newly implemented bass patch) and I'm already playing until my fingers are raw.  This is a great bass for someone who wants to dip their toes in the water...and wants to walk away with a respectable sounding bass.  Several reviews have spoken about the quality of the 2 pickups and I won't reiterate them here, although I generally agree with them.  That said, it sounds extremely good for the price.  Highly recommended!"],["Happy with the Bass.  Purchasers should plan on spending a little time setting it up (search the web for &#34;Bass Guitar Setup&#34;).  It includes the small Allen wrench needed for making adjustments.  It also includes a larger one for adjusting the truss rod, but most people shouldn't do that themselves.  (Mine didn't need that adjustment.)"],["I am a guitar player, and was looking to pick up a bass to learn on.  I opted for this short-scale bass because I wanted a comfortable, slim neck, and I already love the two squiers (a standard strat and a standard tele) I have.Well, this did NOT dissapoint!  The Bass came in great condition, and was really nice right out of the box. I did order a set of nylon tapewound strings, but that if the only thing I feel I need to change at this point.  I absolutely love the look, feel, and playability of this bass.  the Candy Apple Red finish is flawless, as well.If you are looking for an affordable bass, look no further - you can not go wrong for this price!!"],["This short-scale bass is brand new to the Fender Squier lineup and it's a winner.  Squier has really ramped up its quality in the past couple of years with the Classic Vibe and Vintage Modified product lines and this bass is no exception.  As a female player I wanted a short-scale bass because my hands are small and I didn't like the excessive weight of standard basses.  I found just what I needed in this bass.  Its pickups are clear and versatile, the neck is thin and comfortable, it's very light weight, and it looks terrific.  I chose the Candy Apple Red and am glad I did.  It looks terrific!  One thing the pictures don't show is the back of the neck.  It's the traditional Fender satin finish natural with dark \"skunk stripe\". Very classy looking! This bass is a steal for $169 and I can't believe that it will remain at that price for very long. I'm actually thinking of getting the silver one as a back-up. Is it an American Fender? No, but for anything $350 or less it's a knockout. Mine came from Amazon and it was delivered quickly and safely.  This is the third guitar (3 G&L's) I've purchased through Amazon and Ive never had any problems. If you're looking for a bass with similar criteria to mine don't hesitate to try this one."],["I own 4 other electric guitars, but I wanted an inexpensive bass to mess around with.  I tried several basses at the guitar store, and found most of them difficult to play as I have small hands, and a bit of athritis in my left hand.  Being 4 inches shorter than most bases, this guitar is actually pretty easy to play. I'm surprized at the build quality for the price. Came pretty well set up right out of the box. Was in tune (amazing) and the action was pretty good.  I might lower the action a bit, but to avoid any fret buzz, I may just leave it alone. The red finish is flawless. I bought a Gator soft case (Gator GBE-BASS Bass Guitar Bag) through Amazon for $25. That case is a perfect fit for this guitar. All in all, this is a real nice guitar for the money. Very pleased."],["i looked all over amazon for a cheap and afordable bass and this is by far the best i am really suprised at how good of a starter bass this was"],["For the price, this is one heck of a bass.  The pickups sound decent, it arrived with good intonation, and the action was pretty good right out of the box.Please note, as a short-scale bass, this neck is shorter than a standard bass.  I am primarily a six-string guitar player, but wanted a bass for recording demos and the occasional jam session.  The shorter neck feels much more comfortable to me.Pros:-Comfortable, affordable, and fun to play.-Cool aesthetics.-Sounds good plugged in.-Satin finish on the neck is very thin, smooth, and fast.  This makes it easy to play.  I have honestly played on $500+ instruments with necks that weren't this nice.Cons:-The finish on mine isn't perfect.  This is a very minor gripe, especially considering the price.-The hardware is poorly plated.  The tuning machines seem like the chrome plating will peel off quickly.  Again, not that big of a deal at this price range.-I'm having trouble finding a gig-bag that this fits into nicely.  Guitar gig-bags are too short, and standard bass gig-bags are too long.What are you waiting for? Buy this bass!

I do a lot of speed and finesse foot work now on this pad.  Also, hand to foot rolls are easy to practice now.The pad is totally sufficient for these endeavors.

The addition of the beater on my Rock Pedal and the Drum Pad gives the bass pedal a whole new awesome feel. There's now a nice satisfying thump with every hit, which is not too loud, but definitely lets you know it's there. It might be a bit loud for apartments or people who live above others, but on my ground level it's fantastic. The thump also pierces through all the other noise in multiplayer, so you need to be able to keep a beat if you don't want to mess up the rest of the band.The momentum of the beater changes the feel of the pedal as well, and makes keeping long strings of beats much easier. Quick double and triple hits are also easier, but you do need to adjust to them.Great addition of real feel if you can stand the extra sound."],["The Gibraltar gbdp bass drum pad has a good feel and is great for practicing when you are unable to play on a loud drum kit. However, there are 2 flaws in the design. One is, it is not good for double kick practicing because it feels too flimsy when you use your left pedal. The other is the attaching bolt that is on the back of the pad is attached to a thin piece of plastic, and breaks easily, detaching the pad from the mount if screwed too tight, or hit too hard. I'm now on my third one, because 2 broke already."],["While the rubber pad itself is pretty good and does a good job of replicating the bounce of a kick, there is a serious design flaw that makes this pad useless for me:I bought this to practice double kick on. But the edge of the base plate that you clamp your pedal to is about an inch or so too close to the upright that holds the pad. This means when you clamp your pedal securely to the base plate, your beater(s) will be too close to the pad to replicate a realistic drum feel. Your beaters are now not swinging as far as they do when attached to a real kick drum. There is a huge difference in the feel from a real kick. It's actually much easier to do fast double kick patterns when the pad is so close to the beaters. Practicing on this is not ideal because you're not developing your speed and muscles correctly to translate over to an acoustic bass drum.Maybe for single-kick drummers or beginners this is not a big deal -- there are so many positive reviews here for this thing. But it doesn't come close to replicating the feel of real kick. And all Gibraltar has to do is extend the base plate a little bit.I think you're better off using the kick pad from a electronic drumset instead."],["good little practice pad. stable. you might notice a bit of a noise, but its nothing a quick tightening of a screw or two wont take care of.--an FYI if you use axis pedals or wooden beaters--i use this with a set of axis pedals atm. i used another pedal before that had a felt beater on it and never had a problem. the axis pedals come with round wooden beaters that dont work well with this pad. i noticed within a few minutes the axis beaters were damaging the rubber surface. i switched them with felt beaters and its fine now."],["Bought this for hooking up a Reed Switch driven bass pedal for Rock Band ([...] in the hardware forums for info).

I'm not a \"real\" drummer, but it does seem to be a little mushy.  Overall I was happy with the purchase."],["It's a good product. But the rubber is too bouncy. So, this is what you can do to make it feel like a real drum: cut a little hole on the rubber and tap some plastic taps all over the rubber (sometimes the cutting isn't needed, depends on how you like it). This will make it feel just like a real base..."],["I bought this product so that I can quietly practice my double bass techniques in my apartment.The feel of this product isn't going to be anything like that of a real bass drum, that much I can assure you of.  It has a lot of added bounce, so it may feel weird when you transition from this to your bass drum, or vice versa, but that's to be expected, as this pad is made of rubber.  Because of the rubber, it's going to produce a bit more volume than you may expect.  It's nothing outrageously loud, especially not in comparison to a bass drum, but it's not the most quiet sound on the planet either.All in all, this is a decent enough product for those of you who are looking to get into, or improve your double bass.  It's relatively portable, supports double pedals without a problem (I use DW 5000 pedals), and is quiet enough that you should be able to use it in most situations (apartments, at night, etc).

I gave it 4/5 stars because it does have a little bit of a squeaking issue if you get on it, but WD40 fixes that right away.Also, I do agree with the double pedal set-up.

I stuck the grabber arm on the boom stand; I put the mini cymbal stacker on the grabber arm.  I put the 2 splash cymbals on this combo: 10\" on the grabber arm on bottom and the 8\" on top of the stacker. The cymbal stacker is the perfect solution to adding both.  It doesn't add much weight.  It is tall enough so that the splash cymbals do not touch each other even after a solid hit of the drumstick.  I leave the arm and the stacker on the boom stand when I pack up.  You can remove both splash cymbals without dismantling the stacker.  I find that I need to tighten the stacker at the end of every practice, as it apparently loosens up a bit.Overall, this combination cost me just under $100 including S&H; from Musician's Friend through Amazon.

I couldn't tell to look at it, but I guess maybe the metal hook began to wear?I thought of trying to grind it a bit but instead ordered the DW version.  The DW is far more solid...but it was machined with poorer tolerance and it actually clicks when engaging.  So the DW is more reliable and will probably last longer (2 months in with DW version) but the Gibraltar was actually machined with better tolerance had a better playing feel."],["I thought i would use this function more than I do...works flawlessly.Review is based on me not the product."],["This is an ingenious clutch that engages when you step on your hi-hat pedal, but will drop to the closed position when you hit the lever on the top. This allows you to either ride closed hi-hats when using both bass pedals, yet return to normal hi-hat playing when the music calls for it.Be aware that this clutch has only two positions - open and fully closed. However, there is a way to work around this if you like partially open hi-hats in the closed position for a sizzle sound.  I did a work around by placing a spring on the hi-hat stem, with metal and felt washers on the top of the spring, which gives me that opening when I drop the cymbal to closed.  There was a lot of trial and error finding the right spring because each cymbal pair has a different height when mated together, and I was looking for a tiny fraction of an inch opening.  Too small or low a tension a spring and stickwork chokes the sound. Too large or stiff and you will not get the sound.  However, this is all personal preference, and many drummers ride a fully closed hi-hat anyway, which makes this clutch perfect out of the box.Regardless of your hi-hat style, if you are using a double bass, this is a \"must have\" accessory. Gibraltar's model is solid, heavy duty, and engages and disengages perfectly every time."],["This clutch was cheap and that was why I bought it.  I don't know if a more expensive one would have been better because I haven't looked.  I think the craftsmanship is a little sub par on this.  It seems it has been casted from from some cheap metal but I think it will hold up for now.  The part I did not like was the little retention hook that would hold up the top high hat.  The hook would not engage reliably and from the looks of it is because the hook is not flat but irregular or lumpy looking. The spring is also a bit weak to make the hook engage.  I took a metal file to it to reshape the part to make it flat/sharper and now it engages better.  Took 5 minutes to do.  Still not perfect but better than original."]],"title":"Gibraltar SC-DC Hi Hat Drop Clutch","total_reviews":45,"sentiment":0.4707066667,"label":"positive","best_review":["I'm having fun playing with this.

Use the upper part of the sock for the fretboard. I find the ribbed pattern of the sock to be very effective. It will also help you find any burrs on the frets for filing - really only applies to cheapo guitars though.One word of caution, do not use the lemon oil on a laminated maple fretboard like a Telecaster.

Lemon oil was among the favorites for rosewood fretboards. I bought this Dunlop care kit, which came with fretboard dressing, general cleaning polish, and string cleaner.  It also has 2 polishing cloths and a string winder tool. The first thing I did was remove my strings, and apply the lemon oil to one of the faded frets. I used the polishing cloth to work the oil into the wood, and instantly: WOW! The deep wood color was immediately restored. The entire fretboard looks like new again.

I actually picked up this little kit at Sam Ash in Nashville. I am a busy guitarist fighting the fight. It is 4:30 in the morning right now. I am sitting here, practicing as usual on my Number #1 Prs mcarty and I got to thinking. \"Goodness, when was the last time I changed strings?\" The group I play with has been in the studio for the past few months and it has also been a few months since I've purchased this kit.Prior to picking up this little box of magic, I was on a pretty strick string change schedule. Just about every 2-3 weeks I got a string change. Now on strings, if anyone cares, Ive tried em all. Then one day, when money was getting tight, decided to go with D'addarios. Killer strings. Super cheap. Check em out. Anywho. Thats what I've been using for a bit now.I did some research and kind of on a whim picked this kit up as well as the GHS fast fret. Now being a busy guitarist, I'm always playing. Everyday for atleast 2-3 hours, if nothing is on my schedule. But this evening(morning) I kind of snapped out of it and realized its been about 2 months since Ive changed strings. Though the catch is...THEY ARE STILL THE SAME!!!!!Man, honestly, I havent changed strings enough to go through the orange and yellow bottle. The magic is in the blue bottle. Before and after every play time, just brush some of that solution on your strings, I usually let it sit for about 30 seconds and I whipe it off with one of the clothes that came with it, which are great for anything btw... even whipping off my Imac 27' screen. hahaAnywho, had a few beers this evening, feeling good. Proud to support a great product.Now I will say, to all you seasoned guitarists, you will be able to tell that the strings aren't BRAND SPANKING NEW... thought, that little blue bottle goes a hell of a long way. I am amazed. As I stated early, I primarily use PRS guitars(usa) and my primary rig is a Hughes and Kettner Triamp MK2 into an old PRS Harmonic Genorator 4x12(discontinued) with an assortment of great pedals (mxr/moog/tc). But honestly, this has become a life saver.If you read this review. Buy this s***. Its great. When I run out of the blue stuff...I'm sure I'll burn through the fast fret which is fantastic as well, but damn. Go for it people.

I highly recommend this package, and the seller got it to me extremely fast (two days), even though I used that super saver shipping thing. My ONE complaint is that Dunlop greatly reduces the size of the bottles, so they're a bit over like... half sized I'd say, I was under the impression that this was a full sized value package, for like ten more dollars I could have had all three full sized; come on, it can't be THAT expensive to put the extra amount of liquid into a bigger bottle.

I bought this Jim Dunlop MC401 MXR because I have a few bass solos that can't be heard above the other players unless I boost volume, which was hard to do by reaching for the volume knob on my preamp or amp with my hand. This stomp box lets me instantly add a pre-selected amount of volume boost only--no goofy effects, no hum, no extraneous sounds at all. Of course, when the solo is over, another click with my foot drops the boost. This thing sounds completely transparent when it's off, and completely natural when it's on. For my purposes, a boost of five decibels out of the 20 that this device permits seems to be enough. Naturally, you have to have left some head room available in your amp otherwise you won't hear any volume change or you'll get distortion or both, but that should be obvious--it's just like turning your amp up, except with your foot.The MC401 runs on a 9-volt battery, but I also separately ordered the Dunlop ECB003 AC adapter, which is also available at Amazon. I checked the Jim Dunlop website and in its FACs it specifically recommends staying with the same voltage adapter, so I did not order the ECB004, which is an 18-volt model. The ECB003 adapter works perfectly and seems completely silent.The MC401 is compacl, but it's heavily-constructed so it stays put. The stomp switch itself appears to be made of good steel, as is the case itself. Everything is solid as a rock. I don't see how it could be better. Perfect."],["This is a great effect. Awesome engineering as Jim Dunlop's MXR products has always presented. The true bypass feature and the high-end quality materials make it very reliable and dependable.

Highly recommended."],["This Pedal is wonderful, i recommend  to all guitar players . Nice sound, nice boot, clear tone . is one of the best I've had"],["I got this pedal to boost my volume after looping phrases with my digi-tech jammaster. It works like a charm. It's also great when playing along with songs."],["Add a nice spark to your signal, great clean boost! I highly recommend this if you are looking to clean up your signal"],["Works as advertied.  Just what I needed on my pedal board to cut through those loud drums and bass guitar."],["I use this boost in the effects loop so it's after the preamp section of the amplifier.  It gives the boost I need for my leads without effecting my tone whatsoever.  I will always have one of these on my board.  Very well made."],["After much research into all sorts of clean boost options, I went with the MC401 MXR Boost/Line Driver.  My decision was partially based on other reviews, partially on my experience with other MXR pedals, (Carbon Copy Delay and Super Comp compressor) which I've found offer great tone, solid build, and great mid-priced value.My only complaint is the placement of the DC power jack, which is adjacent to the signal input jack on the right side of the pedal.  (I use both Hosa and Planet Waves right-angle 6-inch patch cables, the Planet Waves fit, the Hosa doesn't.) Easy enough to deal with: Just make sure your input jack is relatively small.  (This is so with my other MXR's, so I was prepared.)I'm playing through a late '70's Fender Twin Reverb, which is legendary for it's big, clean sound - and just wanted a simple single-knob clean boost for leads.  This pedal kicks up the volume with no apparent loss or coloring of tone - just more of whatever I've put in front of it.  The Boost/Line Driver is the currently the last thing my signal is going through before hitting the amp, which allows me to keep the outputs on my other pedals - which are very few - at relatively low levels.Bottom line: One nice clean boost and one very happy guitar player!"],["When I hear live bands and the guitar player takes a lead I want to hear it LOUD AND CLEAR but that is rarely the case. Oh, yeah, the band might be loud but it's not the volume that matters, it's the difference between the band and the soloist that matters; the ability of the lead to stand out in front. I notice very little difference between a player's volume when they're playing rhythm and when they're playing lead. Some of that may be their own lack of understanding but if any of it is due to electronics, the problem is OVER. The MXR MC-401 BOOST/LINE DRIVER is a stunning piece of equipment. In the off position it is a clean, true by-pass, just passing your existing signal through without any coloring or distraction. In the on position it gives you a clean, uncolored signal boost, able to add up to +20db with the click of a push button. The lone dial on the unit is variable from 0db to +20db which means that whatever volume you are at, the MC-401 will raise the volume instantly, when engaged, the number of plus db you have dialed in. (Your amp must have the ability to handle the increase. It's like an instant volume dial.) After experimenting slightly at rehearsal I got the general feel of this thing but when I actually used it at a gig, HOLY COW!!!!! This thing is GREAT! Small, compact, rugged as all MXR, simple, and EFFECTIVE. Powered off my existing pedal board power supply (typical 9v) my leads were instantly OUT IN FRONT the way leads sound on recordings. And since it varies from 0db up, it is effective in any size room at any volume. The pedal doesn't care what volume you're at - super loud or super soft - it just does its thing: It makes you louder when it's on compared to when it's off and the amount is consistent with how you set the db boost dial. Also works off 9v battery. Bright blue display light signals when unit is engaged. At $100 or less this pedal is indispensable and virtually priceless!"],["Easy to use, quietly and cleanly boosts volume. I use it on a keyboard when gigging and it does not alter the sound."],["The pedal is very transparent boosting volume without any impact on original guitar tone. And the build is high quality. Great add on to the pedal board for lead boosts."],["I play the bass and have three amp modelers I play through.  Each of the modelers boosts my signal and I wanted a clean boost pedal to allow me to play my bass without a modeler and still maintain my volume.  I needed more than 10db boost and this pedal looked like the solution.  I'm running the pedal at about 1-2 o'clock and it is clean and quiet (very low noise).  Great pedal!"],["Hooked into the direct-to-amp signal path, this pedal gives a massive boost when running a clean signal. However, the boost is very, very minimal when applied to a hi-gain signal. I found the best way to get a lead boost for gain is to run it through the effects loop of my amp. When doing so, the effects loop input and output signals need to be adjusted properly to minimize 'tone suck' from the dry signal. It took about three minutes of playing with the effects loop settings and now we are golden! Either way, there is a fairly significant 'coloring' of the tone so I'm deducting one star for that. Again, this is more noticeable on a gain signal. The clean signal is less affected."],["This is an all around great pedal, which I highly recommend. It can accept 18v too, which gives it slightly different sound and that's what I always use. It's adjustable and that is a huge benefit. Sturdy and should last a lifetime.

Uncolored +20db of clean gain..."],["A very good pedal that you miss only when its off. Super transparent and boosts your signal after all the degradation through your cables.

Experimentation is key with any effects pedal but I was surprised how quickly you can map out several custom settings to suit your needs. Personally I enjoy the analog stuff.

From doubling effects to a subtle warble to a full-blown leslie imitation, this is a very versatile pedal, with each knob having numerous sweet spots.This pedal also has something that most chorus pedals lack, and that's two knobs that you can use to cut both high and low frequencies. This is especially useful for tailoring the sound of the chorus to your guitar. Does the chorus sound too brittle with the single coil pickups in your Fender Stratocaster? Roll off some highs to fatten it up. Does it sound too bass-heavy with your humbuckers? Cut back on the bass knob and focus the sound. And if all of these features weren't enough for you, this pedal comes with two outputs, so you can split your signal into two different amplifiers!Sounds perfect, right? Well, given how this pedal is rather affordable despite all these incredible features, it's the build quality that suffers. The box itself is sturdy enough, though it does feel a bit on the lighter side compared to some other MXR pedals. The sparkly blue finish is eye-catching, but also rather tacky.

I like them, for the most part.  I like the pick material, for the most part, but they havne't replaced my favorite picks (Snarling Dogs brain picks - by far the best picks ever made - you'll never drop them).  The small size is fun for a change, it's easy to be very precise with single notes or with funky rhythm playing.  But...they're just a bit too small.  I go back and forth.  Sometimes I like the size and feel, sometimes they just seem too small.Worth a try, I'm glad I have them, and of course this is all a matter of taste.  The pick itself is very high quality, the material is fairly grippy and has a slightly softer tone than a harder plastic pick."],["Dunlop Jazztone Picks (No. 477) were developed specifically for jazz guitarists in order to improve the speed and precision of conventional pick attack. I find that the 'precision contoured edge' on each plectrum accommodates exactly this - the tip immediately slides down the gradient to the contact point on the string and then is released with almost no catching or tugging, facilitating an accelerated incursion and an uncompromised, full-bodied resonance, a combination which tends to be very revealing of pick dynamics. I have to work harder to articulate cleanly and evenly this way, so I am able to fine tune my right-hand technique when it matters the most - during the actual plucking of the string, the motion from which all others are calibrated. Most of what I had previously channeled into locating the string and then pulling free of it can now be focused on the enhancement of specific tonal characteristics and sheer picking speed. The contour itself offers some protection against digging in too deeply - linear movements in a wide range of directions face resistance if ascending the sloped surface whereas flatter picks would allow unhindered sliding and ultimately waste time and energy. This in turn contributes to a consistency of tone quality as well as an acoustic volume compression effect. Jazztone picks are rigid and durable, resisting deformation much better than similar brands. I prefer model '206' because it reminds me of the traditional teardrop jazz picks, only much more powerful; personally, I am made to feel as though awakening from a dream in which I struggle to play guitar but fail to physically grasp or reach it, and suddenly playing and able to visualize quite clearly the action of the strings in space and time using only my pick..."],["I've been searching for thick guitar picks for a long time. For a time I used a stone pick given to me by Vic Juris. It moved across the strings fast but it was noisy. Then I found the V pick. The colossus. It is a fantastic pick (over 10mm thick!) but still noisy (when it glides across a string it kind of chirps which comes through the amp). Then I came across these incredible picks. They move across the strings \"like butter\". Sweet big tone. Also a hell of a lot cheaper than the v picks. One V pick Colossus is now 34 dollars! I got 18 of these of a little over 8 dollars!!I will say this: I think the V pick Colossus is a great training pick, if you will. It teaches you to relax your hand because of the thickness. I would recommend a Colossus for home and these for gigging. Plus if you lose one of these on a gig you won't cry like a baby."],["These picks are a great alternative for mandolin players that don't want to spend mega-bucks on some of the other big name picks.

Not much noise when they hit the strings, easy to grip, and fairly long lasting.  Great for articulating single lines: does a great job of transferring the subtleties of your attack into the strings, so much that I usually don't even think about it being there.  Probably not the best for strumming, but I don't do too much of that."],["These are the picks for me!  I'm a jazz player using 12-52 string sets and they sound and pick great.

Best I've found in 40+ years of playing."],["You can spend a lot of money on some pretty fancy picks, like Wegans and Blue Chips. I used Fender mediums for years, but when I became serious about playing the mandolin, they no longer did the job.

And they're fine for guitar, too."],["These are my favorite all around picks. They're great for sweep picking especially.  They produce a more mellow sound vs some of other types of picks (Jazz III, thin picks, so on).

The point on them allows articulate playing, although not as well as the Jazz III or Jazz III XLs."],["If you like a medium size stiff pick, this is the one to try. It gives a nice jazz  tone. My only complaint (and it is a very minor one) is that I would like a rounder tip, rather than the semi-pointed one."],["I've tried out a handful of great picks, and these are by far the fastest.  The point on them is much sharper than the image shows.  Some pointed picks are smaller in general size, and I have difficulty getting those to feel right.  These feel right, the thickness is comfortable, and the surface makes them easy to grip.  My only complaint is that it's not good for much else besides fast playing--I wouldn't recommend this for rhythm, for example.  I can't imagine it lasting long in that capacity.  Also, for slower lead playing it's certainly bound to be usable, that's not really taking it to its full potential.So if you want to be able to nail those 32nd notes, this is what you'd want to use."],["I've read so many good reports on these picks and I thought I would try some but the tone is quite harsh and especially brittle on mandolin; even by two very high end mandolins. It must be the material they are made of as they have a nice rolled edge and are quite thick.  These might work for some players but they do not work for me or any of my guitar or mandolin students. Just not a pleasant tone, unfortunately."],["This is truly my favorite pick for all of my playing. It it great for strummed chords, hybrid picking, single note lines, etc. Harmonics are easy to get and it's shape allows you to dig in and off cleanly with very little, if any drag at all.Compared to other Jazztone picks, it sits further back and more comfortably in your fingers than the 208 (which is my ultimate for strumming and rhythm), doesn't get lost in your hand when playing like the 205 (which is great for single note lines, but not for rhythm) and pulls off much cleaner than the 207.For those with no Jazztone pick experience, they are thick with no flex, so if you like your pick to feel like paper, steer clear. For those who want a fast pick that can add a nice snap to your sound when playing those fast runs or like to use minimal effort when sweeping, this is for you."],["Love these picks.

Everyone spends time thinking about pickups, guitars, speakers, tubes, strings etc, when perhaps the biggest piece of gear that can alter your sound is a pick.

If you need a more percussive attack with your instrument and you don't mind the extra thickness, they might be perfect for your application.  I use an assortment of picks and what I use depends on the instrument and the tone I'm after.  The pick I prefer most often is the Dunlop Herco Reissue in Gray.  Also, keep in mind that if you order these because they are &#34;jazz&#34; picks and you want something like the small red nylon Dunlops like Eric Johnson and others use, don't let the &#34;jazz&#34; reference influence you to buy these as these are not like the small red nylon picks in size and feel.

Over the years, I have been using a fairly heavy pick for bluegrass-style flatpicking, but recently I've been playing swing jazz on my archtop (and my Tele with a humbucker in the neck postion) and I couldn't get that nice fat, jazzy sound. I even changed my strings from half-round to flat-wound, but it wasn't until I got these chubby Dunlop JazzTone 207s that I found the perfect sound. The material Dunlop uses on them keeps the pick firmly in my grip without stickiness or added ridges. If the 207 is a tad too thick, Dunlop makes the pick in other gauges, as well.There is another pick that comes very close that I recommend, the David Grisman \"Dawg\" pick. I use 'em on my mandolin and it's an excellent pick. Maybe you can get them here on Amazon, but I've gotten them in the past from Dix Bruce's Musix website store.

I'm buying a bag of 36."],["The quest is unending; the perfect pick.  This is a reorder, I liked the first packet so much.  These are thick; about 2 to 2.5 mm and quite dense in material (seems like &#34;carbon&#34;) that is non-polished but not matte either; an effective gripping surface.  There is negligible &#34;give&#34; and no bounce back like hard plastic or celluloid, which is what I prefer.  The tip is on the blunt side; I would prefer it just a tad sharper.  But the length of the pick and the molded grip within slight indentations on both sides allows for a high degree of control and fastness of grip between thumb and index finger.  This is not for strumming, but for those that use hybrid picking (w/other fingers) with single lines, and arpeggios.  It would be interesting if this line of Dunlop picks (there are a couple of other similar configurations, which I've tried as well) had a soft rubber overlay in the grip area like the Dava picks.  With this model Dunlop, your single lines will have pop, definition, and snap that is not easy to get on a thinner, less dense pick.  And your chordal work using hybrid plucking (as opposed to down/up picking) with the Dunlop JD JazzTone 206 will allow each voice to &#34;speak&#34; clearly if you play with a more pianistic concept as opposed to cowboy strumming or power chording (not that I'm averse to either or being a snob).  I've recorded with these picks and that's what I hear in the playback.  Subtle or undetectable to most listeners, perhaps, but makes a pleasant audible difference nonetheless that might be described as a meaty tone but with a nice gloss on top.  And this holds for all the electric semi-hollow and solid bodies I have recorded.  (I don't use picks at all for full on acoustic guitars, preferring bare fingers or fingers/nails with nylon string models.)  As for these, I'll probably buy a package of 30+ so I don't have to worry about losing them and sharing them with other players if they are open to experimentation.

This is a thick pick and really improves the tone on my cheap Takamine guitar. It takes some adjustment to get used to playing with a thick pick but it is worth trying.  If you can adjust to the difference it does improve your tone. This pick slips pretty easily over the strings but it is different than the usual thinner picks I was used to playing with.

If you a heavy picking hand, then this is the pick for you."],["Dunlop Jazztone #205 Guitar Picks offer a good 2 mm thickness.  This thickness creates a more balanced tone for playing blues or jazz.  The small tear-drop shape offers more control because the guitarist can hold the pick closer to the tip for pinch harmonics.  With a standard Tortex pick the pick is larger and is often not as rigid.  The smaller size and good thickness of the Jazztone 205 cause this pick to be a great choice for blues or jazz guitarists who require more midrange frequencies instead of higher end frequencies from their guitars.I discovered these picks several years ago while visiting the Music 1-2-3 website.  Now, Amazon.com offers the same picks for less cost with faster delivery time.  I purchased these picks (3 dozen of them) for about $5.00 less than the Music 1-2-3 website.I would recommend these picks for any guitarist who wants to expand his range of playing.  Every guitarist should have a variety of picks for different tones.  The Jazztone 205 is a great choice for guitarists wishing to change their musical style without incurring significant cost."],["The Dunlop 205 is perhaps the best \"standard\" guitar pick available today. While many players like large picks, or picks that have a lot of give, my preference is (and always has been) a very hard pick with a point, and a fairly small size. Until recently, this has usually meant a Dunlop Jazz III.The 205 is a great step forward from the Jazz III. Its pick has a softer angle, but is no less sharp. The harder plastic grips well, and feels great in my fingers. The gold logo is a nice \"sharpness indicator\" for me; when the logo wears off, the point is usually pretty well done for, and it's time for a new pick.If you're a jazz player, or any kind of musician who favors a lot of control in your picking hand, you owe it to yourself to try out the 205. I recommend the 3-dozen pack, because once you try these out, you'll have a hard time using any other pick."],["These are pretty good picks. They have a decent tone, but can be a bit over articulate. Personally I prefer the Dunlop jazz stubby picks, but these are great backup picks."],["I've been playing fusion rock/jazz electric for about 24 years, using a variety of picks. My standard used to be Clayton acetal or Dunlop Tortex in moderately heavy gauge. However, I wanted a little sharper attack and less roll-off than those usually provide. Metal picks still didn't sound right, though they do really bite the string for a heavy, cutting attack. These Jazztone picks from Dunlop are just right for lead and arpeggiated runs. They have little resistance, but the point is sharp enough to really let the string go quickly on release. And the low flex allows me to vary the strength of my grip without having to readjust my playing style or position.For reference, I do not like the Fender tortoise-shells, Dunlop gels, nylon picks, or even the standard freebies you get at every guitar store. If you like the way those feel, this may be very odd for you, since they are so thick but tapered at the tip.

I play a Martin D-41 and the tonal qualities and feel of this pick just work. They are easy to hold on to and do not warp easily at all. I keep several in my wallet and they have kept their original shape far better than the regular .60mm orange Dunlop picks. The coating is slightly thicker than the orange version and there is more of a powder-like texture, which I like when sweating slightly or playing for several hours.Also, it may not be a big deal to many, but the lettering on this pick stays intact (unlike many other picks that are completely blank after a few playings).

However they break fast and the tip of the pick tends to get frayed.  Off in search of another pick, which led me here to these, not quite as bendy as the Fender thins and not to thick either.

I've been playing with the Tortex guitar picks for a while now but never realized there is a  \"jazz\" style and a \"standard.\" I bought these picks thinking they were the same size I had been playing with. But when they arrived, to my surprise, they were huge. It wasn't until I did a bit of research that I realized that I'd been playing the \"jazz\" style.Since it was completely my fault in not doing my research on the product, there is no way I can give these picks anything less than a 5 star review because I know what there capable of. They are super comfortable and don't slip around or wear out easily. My advice is, since they are so cheap, buy the standard, and the jazz picks and see which ones you like better. It is a huge difference in your playing in the size of the pick. Don't make the same mistake I did!"],["These are pretty good picks.

I generally use the yellow .88s. When I saw that these were the same in black, I had to order them. I love them and I use them, but they are slightly thicker than .88s. They aren't close to .96mms, but they are slightly less bendable than their yellow counterparts. I took off one star for that, because someone might not be very happy with this fact.

It was a good price for 36 when I bought them and they'll last me forever."],["I've been playing guitar for nearly seven years, and for most of that time I've favored standard sized yellow Tortex picks. (I used one of the shorter ends instead of the traditional pointed end.) When I started working at a Guitar Shop about two years ago, all my friends would rave about Jazz III. I tried the nylon ones, but they just weren't very comfortable to me because the nylon material and raised surface felt foreign to me after so much time with Tortex. The shape of the Jazz IIIs felt funny at first, but after playing with them for a while I began to get used to it and see the benefits of using them. But I still stuck with regular shaped Tortex picks for the most part.When I discovered the Tortex Jazz IIIs, I immediately knew I had to try them. The smooth, finely textured feel of the pick and the familiar tone of Tortex made me feel right at home with these. It took me about a week of using them to really get used to the smaller shape and sharper point, but now I'm a convert. I can't go back to regular Tortex picks anymore. It's like trying to drive a delivery truck after you've gotten used to a corvette! They make for faster, smoother, more accurate picking. They're a great lead guitarist's pick, which had me a little worried about how my rhythm technique would develop with them. I've found that when using them, my rhythm playing is lighter and more precise, and I'm able to retain all the dynamics of a traditional pick. I could see how they would work on acoustic guitar for gypsy jazz or bluegrass, but if you mainly strum chords on an acoustic I'd recommend Herco Nylon Flex 50's, they sound great with acoustic guitars.Overall I'm very satisfied with these Tortex Jazz IIIs. I play a variety of styles, and I particularly love to playing blues (SRV/Robben Ford style). So this pick isn't only for shredders! They're also a great inexpensive alternative to V-Picks. I think I've found the pick I'm going to stick with for the foreseeable future."],["Great for precision and speed. Great for rhythm or lead. You can't go wrong with these. I hate playing on anything other than these."],["Picks are to a players taste. The player I bought these for, loves them and swears by them. Yeah, they are guitar picks!"],["I love them!!At first I thought that the picks were too small compared to the old picks I used to use, but once I started playing with these picks I got used to the size. I also like the sharp edge, it really helps with alternate picking and pinch harmonics. I highly recommend this."],["This picks are one of the best available, because they are easy to hold, easy to play and you can play as good as if you did with the big picks and even better"],["awesome picks,awesome price, and they help you a lot specially when playing fast(yngwie,dragonforce stuff) i also like the fact that they are small,it basically takes away all the extra plastic you don't use in regular picks!"],["Trust me, you're gonna want 36 of these. If you're a 'shredder' or you're trying to be one these are the picks for you. They give a really good sharp, that-Paul-Gilbert-sound kinda sound. If you're looking for something with less attack, go for the regular jazz tortex picks, they are also very good."],["I've been playing guitar since 1980 and have gigged since 1985, and I've always used the standard sized, medium picks. I had never considered myself to have anything more than average right hand technique. I play mostly blues, rock, and jazz now that I'm in my 40s and those are the gigs I get. About two years ago, the guy at my local guitar shop gave me one of these jazz picks to try - and he told me to give it a week and then go back to my old picks. These picks are very articulate and force a cleaner style of picking IMHO. What I found was that my old picks felt very clumsy and prohibitive. 30+ years with the old ones, and a few days with these Dunlops and it was as if a light had been turned. I find I can play much cleaner and faster without really trying too hard. And, for when I bust out the old Ozzy/RR tunes, artificial harmonics are spot on and effortless. I had to change aspects of my right hand technique, for the better I think, to adapt to these picks. It took about a month - I play/practice at least 90 minutes every day - before I was completely comfortable. Let me put it this way: I ALWAYS have at least one of these on me all of the time. It seems crazy, but I can't/won't go back. Do yourself a favor and give these a try."],["The reasons I like this pick include:The shape: I like jazz picks. They are big enough to hold on to. And, small enough to palm for fingerstyle work.The texture: The surface is rough enough to hold onto. Yet, it does not give a harsh top end to the attack.Thickness: It is thick enough for good lead playing. But, not so stiff that it is impossible to strum.Tone: Every pick adds sonic characteristics to your playing. This pick is the closest to my snapping technique and provides a smooth transition between my different articulation methods."],["Highly recommend this pick love the size and the feel , i'm pretty sure i will buy more in the future"],["These are IMHO simply the best picks...PERIOD. I'm a full time professional guitarist (over 35 yrs), and I have a drawer full of castaways from over the years (mostly other Dunlop varieties). These 472RH3's just work the best for me, electric or acoustic. The only thing that could be better would be a Dunlop Ultex 1.14, but in this jazz size (it doesn't exist...YET).Here's a tip I've discovered: If you wash the pick (soap and water...duh) after using it for a while, it will hold better without slipping around between the thumb and finger. Obviously how frequently depends on personal factors."],["i used these before i used the infamous jazz iii picks, forgot about them for a long time, bought in bulk regret all the time i spent with the jazz iii, now i always either use these or the L3.. which although completely different are amazing picks"],["These are my favorite picks, no doubt!

I've been playing guitar over 42 years and professionally over 12 of those. Needless to say, I've tried a lot of different picks and these are the ones after all those years that I've settled on. The size causes you to stay close to the strings (as you should). The heavy gauge puts you in control of your attack (as it should). The texture is easy to hang on to also. A lot of pros use these; maybe you should too..."],["These picks are my go-to picks and have been for 20 years.  The shape and size is absolutely perfect for precision picking and the coating provides a surface that is very slip resistant.  You won't be dropping these during a performance for the most part.I first found these picks when I was in music school and was using the standard, larger picks out there.  I found that I was able to pick faster and with more economical motion with the smaller pick and was never able to go back to a larger size.  I think that you will like these if you try them, but I can't promise that they are for everyone.Pick choice is a completely personal thing, so you might not like the smaller size of these picks, but I cannot see myself ever using a different pick."],["These are hands-down my favorite picks.

The guiro dropped on the floor when I took it out of the box and no cracks or breaks.

I only read reviews about Meinl and Pearl cajons so I never took this brand into consideration.  I walked into the drum section of Guitar Center with my eyes closed, sat on every cajon and started playing. I am no drummer or expert but this little thing was extremely responsive.  The snare portion was clear yet the low-end picked up every one of my finger's inputs.  I even tried out the Meinl's that cost twice as much, yet they sounded like unresponsive crates compared to this thing.  In all fairness, the high-end cajons probably get better with time, but this LP was amazing on the show room floor and out of the box. You can manipulate it to sound really well at low input, yet it's capable of a serious beating.  The Meinl's seemed like they needed some real hard input to get anywhere near the same output.I ended up going home with the LP Aspire based solely on sound.  Not that I mind the psuedo-authentic look of natural wood, but the accented dark wood discretely blends in with other things in my bedroom. This is a plus if you're limited on storage space. Now that I think about it, the other cajons would stick out like bond-fire crate-wood in my little apartment."],["I couldnt be any happier with this cajon. It sounds phenomenal.

However, after playing this drum for a few months, I am not happy.About a month ago, the snare sound developed a very noticeable rattling noise. It's hard to describe, but it is quite unpleasant. I don't play this drum much these days.There are cajons costing $300 dollars or more. I listened to many demos of these on youtube, and wish I had spent more money to get a better one.

First the good stuff, It shipped really fast. Now the bad stuff, It looks cheaper than it is pictured.  The front plate was completely glued all the way around. It took a rubber mallet striking it from the inside out to break the seal. (Hard). Several applications of &#34;goo gone&#34; to melt the glue on the top third, a razor knife to scrape away the residue, repeating several times. Sandpaper to get it to the wood. Replaced the front and thanks to a few tutorials on youtube tuned it to where it sounds like nothing advertised on youtube. Flat, very little bass. There are three sets of snares pressed so tight against the head making little to no sound at all. I will have to take more time to tweek that problem.  &#34;I would avoid this product&#34;, is the only real advice I can offer. I am a kit drummer and hand percussionist of many years.

Don't buy it."],["I went to the store with cash to buy a cajon.  I'm a professional musician, and yes I play drums and percussion among other things.  I'm not a cajon player though (yet) however have worked with enough professional cajon players to know a good sound.First I played a Meinl headliner... their entry level but full featured model for $120.  It was disappointing, unfortunately.  Then I sat on a $300 cajon (I didn't bother reading the make as I couldn't afford it) and found it to pretty amazing - loud, solid, very very deep well tuned bass, no rattles, great present and tight sounding snare, great corner slap, and lots of pitch control with the heel.I briefly played another $300 model that wasn't quite as deep in the bass but also very good and expressive.Then I tried the LP Aspire Accent (dark wood in this case, not that the accent's design changes the sound apparently), and was very impressed with how closely it matched the tones and feel of the slightly lesser of the two $300 models.The LP was in a different league of tone and feel from the Meinl, which was disappointing as I'd hoped the Meinl would be pretty good.I've heard on youtube some great sounds from meinl headliners and some very poor sounds from them.  The one in that store sounded like the bad ones - snares were harsh, deep and loose sounding, bass was thin and high pitched compared to the other cajons, and so forth.I ended up buying the LP and couldn't be happier.At the store the LP had very tightly screwed down top corners so I borrowed a screwdriver from the salesman who helped me to learn the correct way to tune a Cajon (although I had an academic idea already) and we got it sounding so close to the pricey models that it really came down to preference between this ($155 in the store) and the less bassy $300 model.Great product!  I highly recommend the LP Aspire Accent series, or I suppose the 1331 (which seems the same without the fancy finishes).Beautiful looking cajon too - nicest looking of all in the store."],["I was VERY disappointed as soon I opened this cajon.  I waited for it to arrive for a long time because it was on back order, and was very unhappy when I received it.First off, it looks like a really crappy knock off.  It looks NOTHING like it does in the picture.  It is not a nice wood finish as appears in the photos.  Instead, it looks very cheap and the black streaks are painted on in 4 thick black stripes from top to bottom that look like jail bars.  It looks like someone quickly and sloppily painted it.  When I place my photos next to the stock photos it doesn't even look like the same drum.I was not very impressed by the sound of it either, but didn't bother to play it much since I was already planning on sending it back based upon the misleading false advertising.Dealing with OJ Commerce to return it was a nightmare.  It took a really long time to sort everything out because they insisted on charging me a 30% restocking fee plus return shipping even though they sent me an item completely different than the one I ordered!  After refusing to pay this, they bumped it down to 15% plus shipping, but I was still outraged by how absurd it was to charge a customer for their mistake.  Then they told me I had to take it up with Amazon's customer service, who was not happy to hear this story and said they were going to open up an investigation with OJ Commerce because of this.  Amazon refunded the rest of the 15% in Amazon credit, so I only ended up paying return shipping, which I'm still not stoked on, but I'm grateful Amazon stepped it up and made an effort to make it right.I bought this drum because of the great reviews and the beautiful unique look, but you'd be better off purchasing from a different company if you don't want a cajon that looks awful and embarrassing.  Blessings on your search for the perfect cajon!"],["This cajon sounds great, is adjustable and is not too hard to sit on.

Sitting down to play it for the first time was a pretty big let down.  The base is a dead noise, the snares are hard to draw out, and there is no slap to the corners at all.  To make sure I wasn't being picky, I had two friends also check it out and without prompting they identified the same issues.On a positive note, the general look of the cajon is fairly nice.  It's sharp looking, different from other cajons, and has a nice textured seat.I question the reviews on this box; anyone with any sort of experience with cajons should immediately be able to identify this is not a good instrument.  It lacks any kind of life or response at all, I feel like I'm playing a piece of thick plastic.  I would highly recommend looking for another manufacturer, this cajon is not worth the money.

Its slightly bigger than the average cajon which is perfect for me.  I'm not a big fan of small ones.  Overall it is probably the best cajon you can find under 200 dollars but be warned that the snare sound may not meet your expectations.  It does use snares as you may have already read rather than guitar strings.  I have no idea which has a better sound but the advantage to springs is that you can adjust them and it is almost impossible to adjust these.  So unless you want to go through alot of work which may not even pay off you will be stuck with only average and slightly hollow sounding snare areas.  If you don't care too much about snares and more about base this is the cajon for you and will take its place with the much more expensive drums.  If you are really picky about your snares though you might want to look into snare centered cajons which cost alittle over 200.ProsIncredible base sound.Sounds great with brushes.Nice finish.ConsNot super amazing snare sound.Hard to adjust.Starts sounding weird when your hummity rapidly changes like for instance taking it near a campfire.

I've played it at jams with friends, drum circles and even a few acoustic gigs and it never disappoints.

What's annoying about this is how generous Meinl is when considering low side's of their bongo cajons, it seems as if the dividers could add so much more if scooted over an inch or so toward the center of these pieces. Admittedly while both bongo cajons have more dominant low sides, the Meinl ones seem to make playing the highs much more difficult, or impossible when compared to the lows.In summation, because of the dull, dry thud of the high side and my aversion to Meinl as a brand, I think you should consider giving LP a whirl."],["I have to admit this little bongo cajon really surprised me, i honestly wasn't expecting much for $50, even after watching countless video's and reading tons of reviews on it, very few things are ever really that good once you get them in person.Well i have never been so happy to be proven wrong, this drum is aesthetically pleasing to the eye, fun and easy to play, and the sound variations are every bit as impressive as traditional buffalo skin bongos....minus the lack of tuning adjustments of course.I find myself taking it out in the morning and just leaving it out, while going back and forth to play it throughout the day, it's hard for me to put away, it really is easy on the hands, and solidly built, i'm so glad i bought the case for it as well, because i want this little drum to last me a long time.If your considering buying this drum then wait no longer, the only hesitation i made was deciding whether to get this one or the slightly more pricey meinl snare bongo cajon, but i wanted a solid wood drum, no holes drilled for adjustment screws, completely solid and i'm not disappointed in the least."],["This product is not only function but nice to look at, I keep it in my living room like a piece of art.  I have a regular set of bongos but the cajon offers a different sound and feel.  I love that I can play the front, back, sides and top to get different sounds.  I also like the smooth tranistion from the two cavities, as compared to traditional bongos where the hand leaves one to get to the other.  The craftsmenship of this product is very nice, it has smooth rounded edges so it doesn't snag on your clothing while playing.

I was impressed with the great sounds that he was able to get out of a wooden box.  He even let me play it a little after they were done with their set (although I have never really played the drums at all).  I went right home and searched for one on Amazon.After looking at a lot of great cajons I settled on this item.  First, I liked the price; if it ended up in my closet I wouldn't feel as bad as I would if I spent 2-4 times as much for a full sized cajon.  Secondly, I thought that I would be tempted to pick up the bongo more often than I would be tempted to sit on a standard cajon.  Lastly, I have always loved the bongos.  My father had a traditional set in the 50's and I though that they were very cool.The first thing that I did when the bongo arrived was to start to bang on it as I knew what I was doing.  Although the tones of the bongos were earthy and pure, my lack of experience was painfully obvious.  I then brought it to a friend who is an accomplished Latin percussionist.  Wow!  I was blown away with the sounds that he could get out of this small box.  I have now an beginners's instructional DVD which teaches basic bongo groves.  I will be fooling around with this cajon just for my own pleasure.  I plan on ordering a child's version for a local elementary schools music department.  Great and fun item!"],["I had purchased a meinl abs set of bongos which are excellent. So, I really liked the quality of meinl bongos so when I saw these bongo cajons I was curious to check them out. Good reviews all over the net and you tube had some video of people playing them. I got my own set of these and they are very nice and awesome to play! Quality siam oak drums, with no screws or nails which is nice. The tones are sweet and they are very fun to play. Very good price to boot so I say, get these asap, durable, nice looking, and great tone!

The bass sounds pretty good straight out of the box but the snare takes some adjusting to get it to sound good.  There are a few videos online that show you how to make it sound better.  After a few adjustments I got it to sound good but not great.  The snare is kind of lacking, I ended up using some tape on a few spots to get a better snare sound which helps.  There are certain spots that sound better than others for the bass and snare, it really is trial and error to find those spots.  Finally, if you are looking for a decent entry level cajon this is a good one, like I said with some modifications it can be adjusted to sound good but not great."],["I first saw a cajon in a church band and was impressed at the sound such a small box could make. I checked the local music stores' collection of cajons. While there were some that could put out more bass sound, or had adjustment knobs for the snare string mechanism, or were even had amplifiers, the Meinl Headliner served our purpose for the best price. The Headliner comes with a hex wrench to adjust the snare string tension from below. The faceplate can also be adjusted with a phillips screwdriver. We are amateur musicians and play at home for our family. The cajon makes a wonderful simple percussion instrument that anyone can play--even the kids. It is also makes a good seat for playing other instruments."],["It's amazing that a little hollowed out box could make such cool sounds. I'm certainly a beginner at percussion but I was able to slap out some pretty nice beats. I  haven't adjusted the snare strings yet but I assume it will sound even better when I do.  I bought this to be able to add a beat when sitting around with friends singing and playing acoustic guitar, and with some practice I think this will definitely serve that purpose. very satisfied, great price, fast shipping, top quality. also wanted to note that since there isn't any mention of a weight limit for sitting on the cajon, I'm a pretty big guy and it supports me just fine. awesome instrument."],["I ordered this for my son's 20th birthday.

Once I received the Cajon, I got the same worrisome sound.  I simply tightened the snare wires with the provided allen wrench and the sound turned into a good sound.  It's not a masterpiece of percussion instruments; it's a somewhat inexpensive mid-quality instrument.This being my first Cajon, I didn't want to go all out on a 300/400 dollar instrument.  I'm reasonably satisfied with this instrument, and I can't complain that it's not louder or more refined in sound.

We were able today it right out of the box with no alterations but we know when our real drummer friends come over, it can be tweaked. Nice sound, gives a good beat to acoustic music with out all the sleeping and sound amplification that's needed for drum sets. Delighted."],["I was never a drummer or percussionist.  Unless you count xylophones.The first time I saw or even heard of a cajon was when we had a musical guest band come to one of our church services.  I was amazed that the guy made that box sound like a full drum set, and I immediately set a goal to acquire one and learn how to play it.So here I am.The Meinl Headliner Cajon is considered an entry-level/starter cajon, comes at a reasonable price, and has a reasonably good sound.  However, it does take a lot of tweaking to get the sounds right.  This includes using a screwdriver to loosen or tighten the corners on the front panel, and using the included allen wrench to loosen or tighten the wires on the inside (the wires give that snare/sizzle effect).After that, it takes some practice.  Although there is no one way to play this thing, you do have to figure out how to hit it so that it makes a good sound.  For that, there are lots of YouTube video lessons (I personally like Heidi Joubert's lessons).  You can't just slap the thing and expect to get a good sound; you have to know which part of your hand to use and where to hit it in order to generate the sound you want.  It took me a good two months of playing around to finally get to a level where I felt like I could perform.I also purchased a CajonPort, which is a rubber tube that you attach to the hole in the back, which enhances and defines the bass sounds.  I would like to have a bit more snare/sizzle effect, but I think I've done all I could with it (and there are other flamenco or snare cajons which probably have a better snare sound).All in all, this is an excellent cajon to start off with.  At least from my experience with it.  And now I can consider myself a percussionist!  Well, sort of.On a side note, I used a mic with an effects box and got this cajon to sound like Taiko drums.  But that's cheating."],["Bought this to play alongside acoustic guitars. Just a now and then player, but this is super fun.

Barring defect or shipping damage, you should get a great instrument out of the box. Of course, like mine it will likely need tuning.I've tuned my cajon a couple times but will continue to play with it. I had an unusual buzzing sound that resolved when I tightened the bolts underneath the front. YouTube has many good videos on how to tune it- don't be afraid to experiment.I'm really enjoying learning some basic technique and seeing what works for me, as short person with small hands. After tuning and learning just a little bit from reading/watching YouTube lessons, I'm already having a blast.My review would be 5 stars I'd Meinl included basic instructions. It comes with a nice fat catalog- but nothing else."],["The guitar string snare assembly won't sound even remotely like a real snare drum. I tried adjusting and using masking tape, and I have experience playing different cajons.I recommend going to a local Guitar Center where you can actually try before you buy--the tone is just too iffy to buy online. I found one for 50 more than this, well worth it."],["Really fun to just mess around with. Bought this for church and haven't had much use for it, but it is still fun."],["This thing is great! Adjustable snare, supreme tone. Roughened top keeps you from sliding. Can't recommend it enough. A real winner."],["This is my first cajon, and I was really excited when it came.  I really like this instrument, because it doesn't have a lot of tone like the djembe, and it has different sounds depending on where you play it.  This is a great instrument for me, because I naturally like tapping and drumming on things.I was a little disappointed when I first got this, because it had a bad rattling/ringing sound when I played it.  I sat there tightening the strings turn by turn, bit by bit, and this sound still wouldn't go away.  On Heidi Joubert's website, she had several recommendations, including taping the strings and putting towels inside the cajon.  The tape didn't help that much, but I left it on in several places and put a towel in there.I ended up stuffing three towels in the cajon, and now it sounds great!  I think the towels help mute the strings, but allow them to vibrate enough for what is needed.  I also loosened the screws on the top corners to get more of a slap sound when played in that area.I like to play the bass right in the middle using  my wrist instead of my palm/fingers.  It has a better sound that way.  The best snare sound that I can achieve on mine is 2-4 inches down from the top.  I usually play both the bass and snare with my right hand, and keep my left hand at the top for finger rolls with my index and middle fingers.To conclude, this cajon may need some tweaking and adjusting, but once you mess with it enough, it will sound great!  I definitely recommend this to anyone getting a cajon for the first time.

In my mid thirties I had no knowledge of how to read music and bought a harmonica to learn to play; I didn't have the patience or the time, so you can guess how that turned out.  Now I am sixty-four, retired, and have plenty of time and patience and I am learning to read music.  So maybe I will again try the guitar or harmonica, but for now I figure if I can learn to read music and play this cajon it will give me a little background to make learning another instrument easier, or I might just stick with the cajon if I get reasonably good. AND I AM ENJOYING MYSELF DURING THIS LEARNING EXPERIENCE WITH THE CAJON!  It was fun to tune it, it is fun to find where to hit for different tones, it is fun to try to 'accompany' some of my favorite tunes.  And there are loads of accessories available just in case I get good enough! (Foot pedals, hand cymbals, brushes, and much more.)I have a 'How to Play' cajon book with cd on order from Amazon that will hopefully help me to learn this, and I go to youtube where there are countless on-line lessons for playing this.  But I am getting most of my practice by playing Steve Miller Band's 'Wild Mountain Honey' over and over on my stereo and trying to play along.  The drum sound of that song is very simple and easy to follow and I can tell I am improving each day that I practice.  It is a good way to start.The drum itself is plain but well built with internal framing (I weigh 235 lbs and it easily supports me), it has adjustable snares and an allen wrench to make the adjustments.  Also, the upper corner 'slap' is adjusted by the corner screws.  I made both adjustments by following youtube tutorials.I highly recommend this inexpensive starter instrument if you have some time, patience and a musical interest. Also, I noticed on youtube that several exceptionally good players use this model instead of the high priced ones.ADDED:  I received my book and its two cds.

In the past, I had always used the trap set exclusively for playing all of the music with the band.  Initially, I bought this cajon primarily for use in church services each Sunday (I am the percussionist for the choir), where it works perfectly:  the Meinl quality is obviously there, and the portability factor of being able to easily transport the drum is also a huge plus.  Additionally, it is easy to tune, using the enclosed Allen Wrench, which is stored inside the box.  However, I have also recently discovered that the cajon is useful for some of the tunes in the rock band, primarily those encompassing a softer or less vibrant beat.

The wood is decent quality, although the face of the cajon(the part that you hit) looks like it is screwed on without a lot of attention to detail. There are loads of good things about the cajon though. The rubber feet on the bottom are sturdy and nice. The top has some sand-type grip on it and the finish of the wood is good. When I pulled the cajon out of the package and start beating on it it sounded terrible! This will most likely need significant adjustment. I had to adjust the snap corners and the snare sound is still being fine tuned, however these adjustments are all very simple and easy to make, just tedious. I had to watch some YouTube videos and such to figure out the best way to tune this cajon. It comes with an adjustment tool that has a convenient stow spot inside the cajon.

I love taking a mundane object and turning it into an expressive drum. Almost anything works if you can find its individual talent and character. A cardboard box, a sink, a couch, a bottle, a file cabinet, and on and on. I'd been familiar with the cajon for a while, but like with other forms of percussion, I was skeptical that I'd be able to find enough character and variety in it for it to be an all-around instrument that I'd want to play often. Well, let me just say that this thing is really cool.My girlfriend bought this for me for Christmas. Originally she wanted to buy a more swanky thing from Etsy, but I told her that I only needed something basic and classic. If I can make a cardboard box do special things, then I don't need an expensive, custom-painted set-piece. So she got me this one. Mind you it's the only cajon I've ever played, but I've fallen in love with it. And I LOOOOVE rhythm.The love didn't happen immediately, however. Out of the box, the thing had an awful vibration at distinct tones - not a surprise, since the snares inside are made of stretched guitar strings. So I started messing with it. After about a half-hour of fiddling, I realized that if I loosened the two strings, using the supplied allen wrench inside the instrument, to a point where they're loose but still buzz a little, but at a tone that is too low to recognize, then it actually sounds good (bassy and fat). I actually like a little bit of artifact noise in the bass for character, but you can get rid of it altogether by loosening the strings even more. Mine are currently just above that.Then by loosening all the screws on the upper front panel a few turns, I was able to get a nice, crisp snare sound as well. I may mess with it some more, and even try \"preparing\" the drum in interesting ways, but for now it's a real pleasure, with great sound, and it has a way of inspiring some seriously fat, complex beats. Other improvised surfaces only have up to a few inherent rhythmic capabilities, but this is a bona-fide instrument, and totally customizable, that allows me to fully express myself. It's a joy, really.I will say I suspect it may take a little bit of experience with hand rhythm to really be able to appreciate this thing, and to personalize it to a point that it is usable and pleasurable at the same time. It is very basic, but that, along with its good sound, is its major strength, because you can make it what you want it to be. It's a street instrument, essentially, not a Steinway, and its benefits will scale with your skill and imagination. In other words, if you expect this thing to perform for you, you may be disappointed. If you know how to MAKE it perform for you, you'll be delighted."],["Sounds like a snare drum throughout.  This differs significantly from other Cajons I have played, which have a much lower frequency spot available a few inches from the top.  Disappointed.  Sending it back."],["The unit seems well built.  Even the shipping box was sturdy and of good quality.I am just learning to play any percussion instrument at all.  Cajons seems like a good place to start.  The snare works well.  Hitting around the drum face I get a decent variety of sounds.  I wish the deep end bass in the middle was a little deeper especially when I cup my hand hitting.  But it seems fine for a first instrument and this first timer."],["My Grandson love this item.

Best wooden box I've ever got"],["This is my second Meinl headliner cajon (bought it for a friend) and I had high hopes I would being getting the same drum as before. However this time, it sounded nothing like I excepted. I spent along time tuning the cajon using the allen wrench but I couldn't produce any sizzle or snare sound. I turned it tight, lose, and adjusted the top front outer screws, still no snare sound at all. I spent about an hour messing around with it and I've given up. Looking at the two headliner cajons I have, I noticed that the strings inside are different. The original one I bought, has tight, compacted strings but the one I just bought has loose strings. Maybe its defective, I don't know.I've contacted Mienl to see if I am doing something wrong. If not, hopefully I can still return it back to amazon."],["I've been messing around with my new cajon for a while now, trying to tune it just right, but with the particular one I received I cannot seem to get it to give enough snare sound before you start to just hearing twanging from the guitar strings.I was incredibly dissapointed after I received this specific item.  I was looking forward to playing it so much, but it just couldn't give the right sounds. I looked through the hole in the back and noticed the piece of wood that helps apply tension to the strings is off kilter...and this is due to having one set of strings being much longer than the other set.I went out and played the exact same version in a Sam Ash music store and it sounded great...better than the other much more expensive models they had there.  This leads me to believe that I got the short stick on the one I received.  If I had received the same one that I found in the store, then this would have gotten 5 stars easy.  I loved the sound of that one."],["Entry level Cajon Drum, great value for the drum itself, especially if it'll only be a hobby thing. product shipped in one day even though i prefered two day shipping, which is pretty neat i guess. but yeah overall great product. tones aren't amazing but they are better than i expected them to be. 10/10 would buy for a friend."],["I got this as a substitute for drumming while I'm in college, and It sounds pretty great!  I had to adjust the strings on the inside a bit to get a tighter buzz (I tightened the bottom with the allen wrench provided and used scotch tape to tape down the strings).

I inspected it and saw that it had a small crack on the bottom screw.  Returned it and received a new one a few days later.  Sounds solid.

Were this simply a piece of neoprimitive art or decor, i'd have been happy with it.  The problem arose when i started playing it.  It sounded great, but started to crack almost immediately.

I'm not the kind of person who gets all upset about small imperfections, and i assumed the crack was a small imperfection that i just hadn't noticed.  the next day i picked it up again, and started playing it, and more cracks started to apear.

First, the one I received was NOT a PVC Pipe, but definitely made from wood (bamboo to be exact.) I believe some leaving comments about it being a pipe are confusing this one with the Synthetic one also sold by the same company. Also, there is NOT a mouthpiece included with this model, and the PVC one does not work well with this model (it's not meant to.) With the wooden model, you will need to make a mouthpiece out of beeswax, which was much more simple than I thought, it's basically like playing with playdough and forming it. You can buy a Cake of Beeswax from most Hardware stores for about $3-$5 and it takes about 10-15 minutes to create. There are several sites online and videos of how to make one.All in all a wonderful birthday present and a great purchase!"],["This was my first didgeridoo and was really just for learning and experimenting. I've owned it for about 6 months.My recommendation: Instead of buying this one, go for one of those teak X8 didgeridoos. They're only $50 and are MUCH easier to play, sound better, look better, and are better constructed.It is very difficult to learn circular breathing with this didgeridoo due to its wide opening, which causes it to have very little backpressure. Also, vocal effects don't work so well.Because this is bamboo, you can expect several small cracks, but they probably don't affect the sound very much. The sound is slightly deeper than my X8, but isn't as clear sounding.You don't need a mouthpiece or wax for this. You can play it how it arrives.Summary: This didgeridoo is cheap, but hard to play. Go for the $50 X8 Teak didgeridoo if you're just getting started and want something cheap. If you want it for decorative purposes, it looks okay."],["This didge is attractive and fun.  The one I received matches the picture above.Besides producing a quirky, but relaxing and surprisingly pleasant drone -- playing a didge might actually improve the quality of your health and lengthen your life. (Just do a google search for the British Medical Journal, sleep apnea, randomized trial, didgeridoo). If you want to explore what didge playing might do for you, this model is an excellent value, lightweight and carries a quite decent sound.Sleep apnea, or pauses in breathing during your sleep, IS dangerous. These pauses means less oxygen to vital organs and an accumulation of carbon dioxide which can make you drowsy and confused the next day.  It can be a silent force that imperils kidneys, hearts, lungs, raises blood pressure and even makes the effort to lose weight much tougher.Unfortunately media reports and some sleep centers have insufficiently  communicated the full range of dangers associated with sleep apnea.  People walk away thinking that the biggest threat is a little lost sleep and being drowsy during the daytime. Unfortunately, these are only the tip of the iceberg and sail by unnoticed.  The organ damage is more subtle, sometimes even silent until relatively advanced.  For the person with sleep apnea, its really a question of whether they are sleeping safely.  Answer: not very, when the airway is intermittently obstructed.All too often after a few discouraging attempts to wear a CPAP or BiPAP device  mask, and feeling claustrophobic or that it actually disturbs sleep that otherwise at least \"seemed\" normal to them, many of my patients unfortunately just give up trying.  Despite trying different masks there remains a substantial number of people, way too many in fact, who can only make it part way through the night with their mask or not at all.  We talk for years about the necessity of dealing with sleep apnea, but some of them only are able to press themselves to endure CPAP/BiPAP devices after they have finally suffered significant, perhaps irreversible organ damage or other health consequences of the sleep apnea.Hence, didgeridoos are an attractive, low risk, frankly fun way to supplement the management of sleep apnea along with positive-pressure airway devices.  Obviously, one should speak with their physician, consider adding the didge concurrently with CPAP/BiPAP if diagnosed with more than moderate apnea, and for best results repeat the sleep study after a few months (4 in the BMJ article) of didge training to confirm it is working.  Frequently persons being treated should have routine sleep testing yearly to make sure their mask is still working -- the same might also be advisable for the didge strategy.  Your primary physician and/or pulmunologist should be consulted for your specific needs.Participants in the BMJ study learned the circular breathing technique as part of the basic technique for conditioning airway tone and \"practiced\" about 30 minutes a day, 5-6 days per week.  One should probably expect to maintain playing the didge for life -- though duration of benefit among those who later quit was not studied.  As far as we know, wearing CPAP/BiPAP doesn't really condition the airway musculature.  The user remains dependent on their machine so that if they fall asleep in the daytime while watching TV or accidently knock the mask off at night -- they are sadly unprotected.  Thus a wonderful benefit of didge training is that it does condition the airway and could assist in bridging the gap through these accidental mask-off times.I've personally owned 5 didges.  This one is middle of the range in quality, very solid value, easy to use and one of the least expensive so far.  Although this one does not come with a separate mouthpiece, it seems to do quite fine without one for me.  The interested user, however, can purchase some beeswaxBEESWAX BLOCK YELLOW 1-LBand locate a website with instructions on how to fashion one -- a fairly simple task.This didge is constructed from a single piece of bamboo, is lightweight, about 1/4 inch thick, and has a slight bend in the midway down its shaft which actually seems to make it a little more responsive to vibration than my straight PVC models.  Internal diameter varies but 1 and 1/4 to 1/2 inches at the ends.  The vibratory tone is deep, the feel and sound pleasurable (mine is tuned to D, just about 2 octaves below middle C).  Even without a mouth piece it is very responsive to variations in breath or lip technique.  Single-piece didges like this  features one dominant note (with one or more fairly fixed harmonics).  I do like the harmonics for this model, but they are a little weaker intensity than for my other 2 didges.  Its not quite as easy to \"sing\" into this one as it is for my telescoping 300 dollar PVC concert-grade, sliding didge.  BUT the latter is much harder to warm up prior to playing, because vibrations are not transmitted uniformly through the separate segments until it is fully warmed.The painted design varies among these bamboo models. The buyer apparently can't specify what they want.  Mine does not match the picture shown above -- but is nonetheless attractive and should hold up well to responsible household use.

Well I was able to figure out the basic drone in just a few seconds so if you're worried about playing it right, don't be. The actual didgeridoo looks amazing! The paint job looks much, much better than in the picture and if I never really learn to play it, I'd be more than happy to just hang it in my room. It doesn't mention anything about a gig bag, but mine came in one (a little thin and fraying in pieces, but good considering I wasn't expecting it) The only complaint I have about it is that it's hard to hear yourself, but I figured that's probably common in didgeridoos. Great buy for the price if you don't know if it'd be your thing or not!!"],["If you ever wanted to learn an abstract instrument you should consider getting one of these. The didgeridoo is hard to play at first, especially if you attempt circular breathing, but once you get it down it's addicting. I would recommend you consider this one as a starter. I also would recommend trying a PVC pipe first to see if it's for you.This didgeridoo has a very good sound to it. It is authentic and feels good in my hands. Could use some beeswax but you can play without it. I have had fun with mine and I recommend it for anyone ages 10 and up.

As many other reviews have pointed out, there is a built-in mouthpeice. I had no idea how to play so I looked up soem how-to videos on YouTube, and this didgeridoo wasn't tricky at all to start on. This is great for beginners, and a great value. It's really lovely as well, durable thick bamboo and hand-painted images and textures give a real authentic and native-like feel to it. Lots of fun. I purchased this for a Christmas present for my 11 year old cousin who had been asking for one, and of course when it came in the mail, I had to try it out so I could be prepared in assisting him with it before the frustrations got him! Lol, so I'm glad that I found it easy once you search a little how to use your mouth blowing into it and how to hold your lips and everything.

It is covered in fake leather which I have seen that it wears and tears ugly, but I'll wait and see if that happens and when.The drum also comes with a second head, both are synthetic, and a little allen key to tune and switch heads if necessary."],["After learning to play the doumbek using a plastic / goatskin drum I began searching for a more authentic instrument. My original plan was to buy a drum from Hossam Ramzy, which I still might do one day. I sent a message to Hossam and he quickly replied that he would personally select a drum for me, however these drums are hundreds of dollars. The typical authentic doumbek has a plastic head, aluminum body, mother-of-pearl inlay, and is usually not manufactured in the USA. Due to budget  issues I continued my search in hopes to find something both authentic and affordable.Thanks to the fine community of Amazon I stumbled upon this instrument, and placed my order based on the great reviews. Upon receiving and playing the drum I could not be happier. My old plastic drum actually fell to the ground and cracked repeatedly as a gang of children got a hold of it; the doum eventually became nothing more than a dull thud. When I tried to repair and tune it the shell cracked further. It was near that moment that I ordered my new Meinl.The Meinl doumbek is made in Turkey. Removing it from the box, and hitting a doum immediately revealed a richness and sustain that I find very satisfying. Taking the drum around town for the first time was a treat; I found spots that accentuate the sustain of the doums even more. To me it seems like this drum represents everything that could be technically desired in a mid-level doumbek, minus the mother-of-pearl inlay. For the first week I did not even bother to change the tuning. The drum sounded fantastic right out of the box and finally I slightly raised the tension on two or three of the lugs.This is an incredible first doumbek for anyone, and a great second doumbek for me. If I ever go for a third one day I will probably go with a slightly larger drum by Hossam or something with the fancy inlay. I highly recommend this instrument.UPDATE 6/27/14: This is a really great drum to this day! I'm also looking at the same model with the wooden outer-shell since it might produce a slightly warmer tone. Amazon also carries the spare heads for this drum if needed."],["I do not know if it was sent that way or it was in its way to CR but the zipper was broken and we felt dissapointed."],["This was my first time buying a doumbek and i am happy with my purchase. The drum produces a great sound and sits in place comfortibly. The package came with a spare head, a case and an allen wrench for adjustment."],["This is my second drum and it sounds totally different from the Egyptian leather doumbek. This drum seems to sound more appropriate for belly dance type music."],["I got this right on time as promised. The doumbek is lined with a black leather looking material and the top white part \"the head\" can be replaced with a new one. An extra synthetic head is included as well as a carrying bag.  It comes with a screw to tune your drum however you like. You can see the little screws around the top which I think is great!  Once I adjusted the screws just a nudge all around I was impressed by the bassy doum. The teks are very nice and crisp as well.It doesn't feel like it weighs 8 pounds at all. It's just right. And it is very comfortable to hold. I m 5'2\" and this drum reaches my knees.Since I am in a small house, the bass was vibrating the walls... So Im guessing this would sounds just as good outdoors as well.Overall I think it is a beautiful drum, with great sound. I'm keeping this one.Good job Meinl"],["I bought this drum for myself but my more percussion minded husband uses it more often and enjoys the feel and sound. Very nice quality."],["This doumbek has a very clear and crisp tone, and is really fun to play. The doum is rich, bassy, and easy to produce consistently. I really like the teks as well -- a very nice ring that's clean and a bit poppy. I'm often hearing from people how nice they think it sounds. The vinyl covering is comfortable, too, and helps keep the drum stable. I'd also suspect that the covering makes outdoor gigs in cold weather easier to bear, as well.Personally, I'd take this drum over the similarly-priced Alexandria drums any day. If you're looking for your first doumbek and debating between the $100 Alexandria doumbeks and the various Meinl doumbeks, do yourself a favor and get the Meinl. I feel that those cheaper Alexandria doumbeks have an inferior tone to the Meinl and do not have as consistent of quality standards. With these drums you'll be able to learn all the techniques without worrying about whether your drum is a dud. And, if you're thinking that you want an \"authentic\" doumbek, well... these are actually made in Turkey.I do have one complaint, though. It seems difficult to find replacement heads for these drums because they're a slightly different size. The Alexandria heads won't fit unless you create a spacer to put on top of the head's hoop. So far, the only online shop I've found the Meinl heads at is [...]. The price isn't bad though; only $7 each. Granted, it's probably possible to just have a local music shop order them -- the heads _are_ in the Meinl catalog, after all. I just wish that more online retailers (like Amazon) would stock them.Ultimately, the most important thing is that __you__enjoy__your__instrument__ -- otherwise you won't be motivated to practice. Even though I like Meinl doumbeks a lot, it's possible that it's not for you. The best course of action is to get your hands on a few different doumbeks and find out what __you__ like. For example, the Remo doumbeks are another good choice (even though I think the price is a bit high), and you might like those more. Regardless of what you get, make sure that it is tunable (so you can tweak your sound), and that the heads are replaceable; Would be a shame to accidentally damage the head and have to replace the whole drum!"],["Elegant drum with great project of sound!

I thought it was a matter of tuning, but I have not been able to replicate the professional sound.  It may do well as a beginner drum, but I was hoping to not have to buy another one.  Perhaps with practice I will be able to produce a better sound."],["This is my first and only Doumbek so i cant speak to how it might compare to others nor how it plays in the hands of someone who is halfway decent at playing it ;) But what i can say is that i very much enjoy practicing with it. The sound it produces is very nice, it just feels right to me and makes me want to keep practicing. Deep doums, snappy teks and the sound resonates nicely. Whats more, i havnt even tried to tune it, sounds nice to me right out of the box, could potentially sound even better! I think it looks damn cool as well. Ill admit, im a fan of black. But more importantly, the outer covering is very comfortable and feels nice. The white head is also a nice contrast. Came with an extra head, tuning wrench and a handy carrying case w/ strap. I'll be the first to admit, im a 110% doumbek amateur, but i consider myself a bit of an audiophile and can appreciate the intricacies of sound and music.

They are all clearly labeled by sound level.  They each carry a distinct tone so if you are using them all at the same time, you can pick their sound out individually.  The red and black are the loud and extra loud eggs, and they have a tinny sound.  For my personal preference I use and like the white and grey eggs the most.  They have soft sounds (especially the white) and are much more soothing than rattling on the ears. It all depends on what sound you are going for.  Holding the egg sideways and swishing it back and forth can create a much quieter sound from the louder eggs that can be more soothing that normally shaking them.The shape of the eggs makes them fairly versatile - there is so much more one can do with these shakers than you would believe.  Remember that the sound depends on not just the product but how you hold and handle it! :)I would recommend this to any musician for studio or jam session use.  It would also be a nice addition to a drum circle and would add a nice touch to a minor percussion set or music teacher's inventory.  I would think it should also make for great meditative use, especially the white egg.  This would also suffice as an amusing toy for a child of any age, and it seems safe for biting, throwing, stomping etc. as the shell is very durable.  I would caution that its advertised use is specifically for percussion, though.  The contents of the egg are no doubt harmful to children if they find a way out of the shell.Buy it, the price is a value and it makes for a fun addition to every day life."]],"title":"Meinl Percussion ES-SET Egg Shaker Set - 4 Piece","total_reviews":29,"sentiment":0.8078896552,"label":"positive","best_review":["superb sounding eggs and great price. the soft medium loud and extra loud is just wonderful for more acoustic stuff. would for sure recommend these"]},{"asin":"B001TX2ZJQ","brand":"Meinl Percussion","imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41s58nBcM0L._SY300_.jpg","rating":[0,0,0,1,17],"reviews":[["My baby use to drop everything on the floor and this little shaker still sounds great"],["You cannot go wrong with this.

That first 55 was actually much bigger than the following models and was affectionately called the \"bird cage\". I have a couple of those large 55s in my mic collection.Today's 55SHII takes the second, scaled down model, adds an on/off switch and has updated the mic capsule to a quieter, more modern sounding cardiod pattern, which helps control feedback while onstage near monitors or front of house speakers.The recent line that I've seen don't have the fit and finish that the originals have, but they still have that same classic look. And they sound even better today.So if it's the classic rock 'n roll look you want, there's really no other mic to get. Grab a couple of Shure 55SHII \"Elvis\" mics while they are still making them.

Make sure to get a good stand with it:Atlas Sound MS 10C All Purpose ChromeOne thing to be aware of is the sensitivity to where the vocalist is relative to the mic; really is front-address only. If you're too far above it, it won't capture the sound. Minor thing, but be aware of it, as I've had to tell some performers to really stay up on it.Biggest gripe, the placement of the switch is a little annoying, I've had two different performers accidentally turn it off mid song, while rocking out.

It gives a very true representation of my tone, and doesn't accentuate plosives at all -- even when the volume is cranked up. I've gotten lots of compliments from musicians who can't believe how inexpensive the mic is for the quality. Plus, it looks FANTASTIC on stage.Recording is great, too. It picks up vocals without pulling in too much ambient noise. It has a warm, well-rounded sound.I love this mic!"],["excellente response, too much cheap, very very dynamicso that is a shure what else can be expected i love it"],["The iconic look of the Shure 55SH microphone is enough to justify it's purchase, but it helps to compare it with the similar (and considerably more expensive) &#34;Super 55&#34; also offered by Shure.  While the 55SH is more affordable and offers the additional feature of a switch, it isn't as sensitive as some of Shure's other excellent microphones.  You can compensate for this either by increasing the gain on the amp or using a PA preamp, and with those considerations the mic performs extremely well, especially in live conditions.  The effective &#34;super-cardoid&#34; pickup pattern means that monitors can be placed directly in front of the singer and it will not feedback.  I've used it for several months now in a swing band, and we love the way it looks and the way the singers look and sound when they are using it.The only cons I can offer are a) we thought we would like the switch on the front, but it turns out that the switch can accidently be turned off by the singer (problem until the singer figures out what happened), and b) a singer who prefers to hold the mic in their hand will not like the heavy weight... it's meant to stay attached to the mic stand.  We solved the first problem by putting a clear plastic guide over the switch plate to hold the switch in the &#34;on&#34; position.  Remember this mic is meant to mimic the &#34;good old days&#34; when microphones were big, heavy things and no one held them in their hands.  Elvis used mics like this when he first started, and radio announcers could hide behind their mics.Shure holds it's retailers to a minimum retail price, so it's hard to get a deal on one of these.  We were happy with the sturdy  brushed chrome construction and performance of the mic, and I've already been asked to allow friends to borrow it for special functions.  This one's a keeper!Bottom line is... you can get smaller Shure mics that sound just as good or better, but if you want both retro looks and great performance, the Shure 55SH will be your first choice."],["Excellent vocal mic..has that warm, clean, clear sound.

I immediately compared them to the old ones to verify there was no wear on the older ones but I replaced them anyway because I did the &#34;break in&#34; procedure on my old needles which caused the shafts to develop kinks in them.

Obviously I can't get my hands on every pair of headphones on the planet, so there are probably many I have missed.  But, having tried a lot of them, all I can say right now is that these are a big step above everything else I have.The overwhelming experience I get is feeling free of that central cloud of something.  Every speaker, headphone or not, has its own sound which it adds to the music.  This makes different sounds coming through all sound the same by just a little bit.  You've got one instrument in the left ear, another in the right ear, and both have that particular pair of speakers' \"color\" or \"tint\" or whatever the heck audiophiles like to call the \"character\" a speaker adds to its output.  I just call it another form of distortion, and it gives me the feeling of the different sounds all having a central non-specific stuffiness.  It's the kind of thing you don't notice until you get better headphones and realize that the instruments were supposed to have a much more open and separated sound than what you were hearing before.Every time I get a truly better pair of headphones, it's the same general experience.  I can hear tiny sounds which were muddled or masked with cheaper headphones, and I find that the louder instruments have a more complex and interesting sound than I knew before.  With a good pair of new headphones, I can listen to all of my old music with a fresh feeling, and these definitely do that at a completely new level.So yeah, these are awesome.  But what about all of the comfort and convenience features?The first thing I noticed upon opening the outer packaging, and then the included storage case, is a godawful brain-stabbing toxic smell.  I don't know what the he## Shure used to make this storage case, but it nearly knocked me out.  I kept the headphones separated from the case for several weeks to ensure that the headphones lost these fumes, while the case is still deadly.  The case is also too small be about half an inch for a reason I will describe soon.The second thing I noticed is that the cord is replaceable, because I had to assemble it before use.  Someone else thought this was a waste of money, but the thin wires of expensive headphones make me nervous with the way they are always dangling around and just waiting to break and ruin the whole setup.  I get a lot of peace-of-mind knowing that if I damage the cord I can just pull it off and plug in the included spare.  But here's why the storage case is lame... with the cable attached, they don't quite fit well into the case  unless you are comfortable with an apparently stressed wire pressed against the side.  So the tiny wire plugs must be pulled off every time.  Oh well, I don't want to carry around that stinky case anyway.The third thing I noticed is how soft, fuzzy, and comfortable the [replaceable-spares-included] earpads are.  I can wear these things for hours (and in fact have been as I write this) without feeling the need to fiddle around with them like an old man trying to avoid bedsores.  The earpads are oval-shaped and angled slightly backward, which is anatomically appropriate and allows almost zero direct pressure against my ears.What I didn't notice immediately, until I switched to some older headphones, is that this soft and fuzzy material creates almost no noise if the headphones are shuffled and adjusted.  The common pleather overwrap design of a lot of other headphones (sadly, even some other expensive headphones) can create some annoying crinkling sounds.Shure took some truly good drivers and put them in a very nice package (except for the literal packaging).  It's a very impressive pair of headphones with no notable weakness to drag them down.  Just plain good all around."],["These are quite simply the greatest headphones I have ever tried.When I received them I was surprised by the massive, tank-like box, they arrived in.  The box included: earpads, cables, headphones, and a huge well padded case.  The case is well built and should protect the headphones well when traveling.The earphones are quite comfortable.  I tested them with my HK receiver, and with my iPod.  What immediately struck me was the sound balance.  I'm not into the big thumping bass, if you are you may want to look elsewhere.  I notice more detail than with my hold headphones, which I guess is to be expected at this price point.All around, an amazing set of headphones, with a wonderful well balanced sound.  You will not be disappointed."],["I sent these back, I bought them online after reading a very positive review on WHAT HI-FI magazine where they actually won a test against: Sennheiser HD700, Grado Labs PS500 and Beyerdynamic T5p. They are very comfortable to wear for many hours but when it comes to sound stage, stereo imaging  and detail I personally prefer Grado Labs headphones(currently own old SR80s, SR150 and my favorite Grado RS2i, AKG K701, Sony MDRV6.I listened to these headphones for near 8 hours after 60 hours break-in period using a FiiO X3 player with built-in amp and gain set to \"high\", they sounded to me like headphones in the $200-$300 price range at the most. Also the product manual states that these \"premium\" 'phones contain a chemical known to cause cancer in the state of California. The product manual and Shure's website does not mention any period of break-in at all needed on these before they sound \"right\", neither I notice any major improvement in sound quality after 68 hours of use. I recommend trying Grado SR150i (although most Grados headphones are not very comfortable) before spending $500 on any other on ear headphones."],["I just received these headphones, and my immediate impression is to say \"wow!\"  Compared to my Sennheiser HD600s, which I've had for a number of years (and which are a very fine sounding headphone), the Shure SRH1840s do not sound like you're listening to a headphone at all.  By this I mean that the openness of the sound is incredible.  When I first put them on, I thought I was listening to my speakers - this is how \"open\" they sound.  In addition, if you're a lover of any music which contains detail, and would like to hear all of the detail containing in a recording, these are the headphones to get.  My only (minor) criticism has to do with the headband, in that they could use slightly more padding, at the point where they rest on a listener's head.  But this is a minor quibble."],["If you are doing any studio work or mixing or any other type of music production then you owe it to yourself to invest in a set of these Shure headphones.  Shure is the premier name in headphones and these babies don't disappoint.  When doing studio work you will pick up minute details in the music that you can't hear as well with other headphones.  If you are serious about music this is the way to go.  If you are just looking for something to hook up to your ipod/iphone to listen to music these are not what you are looking for.  Keep in mind that these are open back headphones and really designed for professional work.  I would suggest investing in other Shure headphones designed for music listening versus production as they make the best in that category as well.  If you are into music production/mixing or even movie or multimedia production these are the best you can get and they DO make a difference."],["This headphone has very sweet sound.  Soft and wet.  I prefer it over the HD650 for vocal.  This headphone can run on anything.  You don't need additional amp for it to sound good."],["Update 28.3.14: The Jennifer Warnes track listed below demonstrates a definite weakness in the 1840 bass. Check it out.Sources: iPhone4s with PA2V2 amp using LOD, various PC's running Foobar2000 using the Audioengine D1 DAC and the D1's headphone out.The first thing people want to know about a new headphone is &#34;How does it sound?&#34; In the case of the SRH-1840 the verdict is: Excellent. The second question people ask is &#34;Is it worth the cost?&#34; That determination is purely subjective of course, and takes into account things other than the sound. My verdict: Yes, with no reservations. I'll get to the details of that sound after first describing the 1840's physical characteristics.The SRH-1840 has a proprietary double-entry detachable cable that's about seven feet long and straight (not coiled), terminated by a standard straight (not angled) miniplug. A 1/4 inch (6.35mm) adapter is supplied and screws onto the miniplug. I can't be certain whether the miniplug would fit into any of the recessed sockets on music players that have such things, but the threaded portion of the plug ahead of the business end is 7mm in diameter including the threads. The cord is made up of two side-by-side strands that are bonded together, where each strand is 3mm thick, and those two strands separate at a strain-relief and join the earcups 'Y'-style.Many people feel that single-entry headphone cables are a better choice because they're more convenient, i.e. they don't get tangled as much as double-entry cables. The price for that convenience is potentially worse sound due partly to the fact that the total cable length going to each driver is different, and partly to the requirement for a thin cable running across the headband to get the signal to the second earcup. Fortunately, the SRH-1840 matches my personal preference.The SRH-1840 comes with two identical cables, the 6.5mm adapter, an extra set of velour earpads, and a semi-hard carrycase that affords good protection when transporting the headphone.Since the 1840's cable has a standard miniplug with optional 6.5mm adapter, one might assume that Shure intended that it could be used with portable music players. Since laptop and desktop computers also have miniplug jacks, and because the 1840 is less efficient than most of the headphones that are typically used with portable music players, I'm going to assume that the intent for the miniplug is to be used primarily with computers. I did try a few relatively low-volume tracks with the iPod Touch alone, and while those were barely adequate for playback indoors where it's fairly quiet, they would not be adequate for playback on-the-go. If you do require that kind of playback with the 1840, you will probably need to increase the volume of at least some of your music tracks.The earpads are fully circumaural and plush velour, with openings that measure approximately 1-5/8 by 2-1/2 inches. The inside of the cups have cloth-covered thin spongy pads so the ears don't contact anything that would cause discomfort. The earcups appear to be some type of high-grade plastic, with a headband of metal alloy that provides good flexibility, light clamping force, and (since the 1840 is so light), good stability with no tendency to shift when I move my head around.The headband has small spongy pads underneath which feel very comfortable on my head, but if there is any tendency for discomfort in spite of the very light weight of the headphone, I recommend pulling the earcups down just slightly more than the minimum, to let most of the weight be borne by the earcups and not the headband. Note that the earcups of the SRH-1840 do not rotate in any direction, although there is a small amount of movement back and forth to allow alignment of the earcups to different sized heads.The SRH-1840 is a snazzy-looking headphone if you've seen photos of it, so it has a modest bling factor that you don't have to pay a premium for. I would rate its appearance as 8.5 out of 10 and I would rate its comfort factor equally high. The reason the appearance doesn't get a 9 or better is because the 1840 isn't a fashion headphone, so my subjective rating of 8.5 is probably as good as you can get for a serious hi-fi product like this. The reason I didn't rate the comfort 9 or higher is because the 1840 is a full-size headphone with moderate clamping pressure to keep it stable on your head. Having said that, I've never had a full-size headphone that felt this comfortable - the next best thing to no headphone at all.I'd like to describe the sound of the 1840 in terms of a predecessor - the Shure SRH-940 - partly because they are family-related, partly because I have both, and partly because it will be a less complex task given certain similarities.The SRH-1840's general signature is best described as: Bass slightly less than the 940, upper treble very similar to the 940, midrange similar to the 940 except where the 940 has a slight emphasis around 500 hz, the 1840 has a slight emphasis about an octave higher. I tend to regard the 1840 as bass-neutral in spite of having less impact than the 940, and for those users who prefer more bass than what the 940 provides, they will have a similar impression of the 1840 - not for bass-heads. The 1840's midrange is essentially flawless with great rendition of voices and instruments, and given the overall smoothness from the top of the treble to the bottom of the bass, as good a listening experience as I've ever had.The standout area for the 1840 is what I call the &#34;presence&#34; area - that part of the lower treble that makes voices and some instruments sound more (or less) &#34;alive&#34;. This would be in the area from 4 to 6 khz I think, and whatever the exact specifics, the 1840 has the best reproduction I've heard from any headphone. Where some of the more expensive headphones from various manufacturers have been criticized for being too bright in this range, I believe the 1840 is the perfect answer. I feel like I can listen for hours on end with no letup, hearing the inner details of music tracks I've played many times before, but haven't enjoyed nearly as much.Being an open-back design, the SRH-1840 has almost no isolation. The soundstage is slightly better than the 940's, which might surprise some users who aren't aware of the 940's above-average soundstage for a closed-back design. Listening to the 1840 I never get a sense of constriction, compression or any other such quality - the sound is always airy and effortless. Sibilants seem less bothersome with the 1840 than most other premium headphones I've used, and there is another important aspect of the 1840's sound that merits special mention: The quality of the upper harmonics of instruments and voices is exactly what I would hope for in a premium headphone but don't always get.Now that I've covered the basics of the sound, it's time to describe how the SRH-1840 sounds with a variety of music that's available on CD's or as high-quality downloads from Internet music stores. I've used the following examples in other reviews, so these will serve as good test tracks for this review and the results can also be compared to the results noted in the other reviews.Bauhaus - Bela Lugosi's Dead (~1980): Strong midrange sound effects - this is a good worst-case test for resonant-type sounds in the most sensitive midrange area. Handled very well by the SRH-1840.Beethoven Symphony 9, Solti/CSO (1972): Excellent overall sound and particularly striking how the SRH-1840 reproduces the triangles, bells and other background instruments that are often obscured with other headphones that have limited high frequency response. Of special note for this headphone are the bass impacts beginning around 10:30 of the fourth movement.Blues Project - Caress Me Baby (1966): Rarely mentioned, but one of the greatest white blues recordings ever. The loud piercing guitar sound at 0:41 into the track is a good test for distortion or other problems. Handled very well here.Boz Scaggs - Lowdown (1976): Good sound quality - this is a great test for any nasality in the midrange. Handled very well by the SRH-1840.Buffalo Springfield - Kind Woman (~1968): A Richie Furay song entirely, rarely mentioned, but one of the best sounding rock ballads ever. This will sound good on most headphones, but it's a special treat with the SRH-1840.Cat Stevens - Morning Has Broken (early 70's): A near-perfect test for overall sound - this track will separate the best sounding headphones from the lesser quality types. Nothing specific, except that almost any deviation from perfect reproduction will stand out with this track.Catherine Wheel - Black Metallic (~1991): Goth with industrial overtones - I like this since it's a great music composition and the sound effects are smoothly integrated into the mix. This may sound distorted or mushy with some headphones, but the SRH-1840 renders the deliberate instrumental distortions clearly.Def Leppard - Bringin' On The Heartbreak (1981): MTV goth/pop/metal at its best - good ambience and high energy - the better headphones will separate the details and make for a good experience. Lesser quality and the details tend to mush together.J.S. Bach - E. Power Biggs Plays Bach in the Thomaskirche (~1970): Recorded on a tracker organ in East Germany, the tracks on this recording have the authentic baroque sound that Bach composed for, albeit the bellows are operated by motor today. The SRH-1840 plays the tones seamlessly through the upper limits of the organ, which cover nearly the full range of human hearing. Of special note are the pedal notes - tracker organs have low-pressure pipes and don't typically produce the kind of impact around 30-35 hz that modern organs do. A headphone that's lacking in the low bass may sound bass-shy with this type of organ, but the SRH-1840 provides a satisfactory experience.Jamming With Edward - It Hurts Me Too (1969): Intended originally as a test to fill studio down time and set recording levels etc., this was released a few years later for hardcore Rolling Stones fans. Although not as good technically in every aspect as the Chess studio recordings of 1964, and in spite of the non-serious vocals by Mick Jagger, this rates very high on my list of white blues recordings, and sounds absolutely delicious with the SRH-1840.Jennifer Warnes - Rock You Gently (1992?): The strong deep bass percussion at the beginning of this track has been cited as a test for weakness or distortion in certain headphones like the SRH-1840. Compared to the v-moda M80 which is noted for a strong lower bass, the M80 has a distinctly richer sound with those notes and a stronger impact. It's tempting to assume that the M80 is better, but the final analysis is in the extended listening. Having played this track many times now, I'm highly impressed with the SRH-1840's bass reproduction and detail throughout the track, and even the beginning notes have a nice clean-sounding thump to them.Jimmy Smith - Basin Street Blues (early 60's): This track has some loud crescendos of brass and other instruments that don't sound clean and musical on some headphones. The SRH-1840 provides excellent reproduction. Listen particularly to the second crescendo at 15 seconds in, for maximum detail effect.Ladytron - Destroy Everything You Touch (~2009): Featured in The September Issue, this song has heavy overdub and will sound a bit muddy on some headphones.Milt Jackson/Wes Montgomery - Delilah (Take 3) (1962): The vibraphone is heavily dependent on harmonics to sound right, and the SRH-1840 plays it superbly.Pink Floyd/Dark Side of the Moon - Speak To Me (1973): Strong deep bass impacts will be heard and felt here.Rolling Stones - Stray Cat Blues (1968): Dirty, gritty blues that very few white artists could match. On some headphones the vocals and guitar lack the edge and fall more-or-less flat. If you're a really good person, playing this song will probably make you feel nervous and uneasy.Tony Bennett - I Left My Heart In San Francisco (1962): Frank Sinatra's favorite singer. Highest recommendation. With some of the best headphones, the sibilants on this recording are very strong, but they're not bad with the SRH-1840."],["How does this sound? You're sitting in a recording studio, looking across the glass at your favorite artist. The engineer hands you this Shure SRH1440 headset and the sound explodes into your head in a way that almost can't be described. Your delight is noticeable, not just with your ears, but your whole body as a rush of adrenaline soars up through your chest. The sound is spectacular, like nothing you've heard - even in concert - where crowd noise and acoustics rob the listener of most of the experience beyond the visual.Incredible headphones for both audiophiles and casual listeners.If you're used to smaller headsets or buds to listen to your music, you'll be shocked at how great this comfortable Shure pro tool works.Worth the money? You've already decided it probably is, if you're looking at this and know the price tag.Treat yourself, go ahead!"],["The SRH1440 by Shure is my first set of over $20 headphones. There are great things about this and some things which may steer customers away. I'm not an expert on headphones, but after using these for well over a month, I can now tell you what I think of this product.When opening the box, you will find a hard case, which contains the headphones, the wire which connects the headphones to the device, and a  inch adapter. The box also features a spare chord and replacement ear pads. There is also a manual. The chord has red and black connectors for the headphones. Maybe I have such little experience, but I didn't realize that red means \"right\". However, the headphones did not make it clear to those more inexperienced like me that the red connector goes to the right (I looked it up in the manual).As mentioned before, the quality of these headphones are far superior to that of any others I've owned previously. I am a hardcore classical music listener, a genre which is famous for its wide range of dynamics. This product allows me to hear everything in the lower register at an extremely soft volume with ease, while moments later I don't have to turn down the volume due to distortion after the massive influx in sound. This is great for a music major like myself. Another small issue that may divert people from this is the lack of surround sound; so if you're a hardcore FPS gamer or want to get a full experience watching a movie, you may want to rethink this.Overall, as somebody who is new to the professional headphone market, I think this is a great product for listening to music. While I had a very minor setback in initial startup (like two minute) and the lack of surround sound (which it doesn't advertise it has), the SRH1440 by Sure is a set of headphones I would recommend."],["Best head phones ever. Clear professional sound thats is worth getting them. If your looking fo a lot if base this is not the kind you will like to get but its a good rich clear quality sound"],["I confess that I have a certain addiction to headphones -- probably because music is such an integral part of my existence and because of my office environment where if I don't have some way to block out my co-workers, it would not end well for my co-workers or myself.I tend to go back and forth between earbuds and headphones.  I like earbuds for their minimal size/weight and generally cost.  However, often I get tired of having to jam something in my ear so like over the ear headphones as well.I had a wonderful EXPENSIVE set of Denon's but alas, they were damaged in my last move and I hadn't had the heart (or money) to replace them.  I also recently purchase the SRH940 headphones because I was concerned that due to the open design of the 1840s, too much noise would \"leak\" out these might not be a good choice for my office.  Also at more than twice the price as the SRH940, I wasn't sure if I wanted to \"risk\" something happening to them by taking them to the office.I listen to a wide range of music but purchase based on my love of classical music.  So tonight I sat down with both the SRH940 and the SRH1840s and had a little side-by-side comparison.I used my iPhone 5 as my listening device and all of the music I chose was ripped directly from CD using the Apple Lossless format.  The pieces I chose to listen to were:Bach Chaconne for Unaccompanied Violin -- (Perlman)Brahms Symphony #1 -- 1st movement (Solti and the Chicago Symphony)Saint Saens Piano Concerto #2 -- 1st movementI think I was expecting a much bigger difference (at least based on price) than there really was.  Not surprisingly -- both sounded very very good with VERY subtle differences -- differences I probably would not notice if I were sitting in my office with background noise (as opposed to alone in my house with no distractions except for my cat who insists on shedding in my lap!)Here are the differences:-- SRH940 had a louder \"harsher\" sound -- not surprising given that they have a higher sensitivity rating (in essence, they will be louder because the earphones are more \"efficient\" at producing sound.  Perhaps the \"harshness\" was due to the louder sound but I did adjust the volume to try to control for the difference.  However, the SRH1840s seemed to be more \"refined\" and \"mellow\" -- sort of a difference between a fine old violin vs a brand new one that you would purchase from your local big-box music store for 300 bucks!-- SRH940 had a more \"detailed\" sound -- whereas the 1840s tended to have a more \"blended\" sound.  When I was playing the piano concerto, one of the things that struck me was how distinctly I was able to \"picture\" the orchestra in my head because the violins were quite clearly coming from the left ear and cellos and basses were on the right side.  The piano was off to the left side but more \"centered\" than the violins.  With the 1840s -- you didn't notice the \"placement\" of the sounds to the same extent -- it was a more nuanced and \"blended\" soundstage.  Which is better?  I suppose it is a matter of taste.  Having played and attended many symphony concerts, I tend to think that the separation as you get with the 940s seems more \"real\" to me.-- The SRH1840s are more comfortable -- they are lighter weight and the ear cups feel software and don't \"clamp\" your head as hard as the SRH940s... both have velour pads but the first time I tried on the SRH940s, my first thought was whether I would get tired of wearing them after awhile.One difference I expected to find but didn't really experience was the external sound from the open vs close headphone design.  I expected that the SRH 1840s would be much louder externally than they were.  However, I found them to be roughly comparable to the closed SRH940 designs.And while these have a lower sensitivity, they were more than capable of playing music at a volume that would have left me deaf after a few minutes if I chose to go that high... in other words, contrary to believe that these are not suited for \"i-devices\", they did very well.  Just be aware that they could draw more power from your device so you probably want to have a charger available all the time.Which pair do I prefer?  If I could only pick one -- I would pick the SRH 1840s because of the comfort and more refined sound.  However, was there enough of a difference to justify spending the extra 350?  In all honesty -- no -- at least not under the circumstances for which I will be using them.Perhaps both pairs are OVERKILL for my purposes -- listening to music from an iPhone, iPod or my Macbook Pro -- as my dad always said, the sound will only be as good as the weakest link.  However, I like to think that the corollary is that even relatively poor equipment will sound better with high-end \"output methods\" (i.e. your headphones or speakers).This may be a relatively \"specialized\" review and just my humble opinion -- your mileage may vary.[NCJVR]"],["I have SRH1440 and this is my second Shure headphones. It has a amazing sound and much better than SRH1440.I'd like to say SRH1840 is better than HD 600 even the HD650, better than the ATH-AD2000x, better than the AKG K701 and K702And the box of the headphones is soooooooooooooooooooooooo big!"],["Before buying, take some time and see if suits your life style.Open Back Headphone: Sound will leak, you can't use it in a noisy environment.Input impedance: These are not head phones for mobile phones or laptops. You will need some decent amp to enjoy the wide open aurora.Quality of Music: Good quality gear will make bad quality music sound worse, than the amped up in-ear head phones. Most of the low cost headphones have a U shape response. They make the high and low over power the mids, so you hear lot of thuds and screeching highs. It may sound energetic, but you are missing a lot of details. Start enjoying 192Khz or loss less music, try old SACDs, even most of the CDs are not half bad. 128Kbps MP3 and Shure doesn't get along that well.Very light weight headphone, you can listen to music without any fatigue. It is quite portable too, comes with extra earpads, cables, travel case. There is no penny pinching here. It comes with every thing that you will ever need for its life.Another open back head phone I love is AKG. Both have similar traits, but Shure is a little bit more forward. Can't stop admiring the huge sound stage and details. Every CD sounds new and exciting. If you have never had open back headphones, use a small sponge to cover the port on your speakers.  Once you close the port, the bass extension will be deep.. but not as exciting as when it was open. Producing deep bass with a open back needs a much more powerful driver. If you are looking for a dead neutral and calm headphones, at this price point there is no other headphone to compare. After leaving the headphones to break-in(yes I believe in it !!!), it was a blast listening to variety of music.Voices come in dead center, instruments were as spread out as a live orchestra. To give examples, Eagles collection CD. The drums were so fast and sharp, no other head phones played the attack so fast and sharp. Even at low volumes, vocals and drums had perfect isolation. R&B; is another difficult things for headphones, with multiple layers of voices and music, most the cheap head phones simply high light the low end thug and leave every thing else muddied. Loved how well Shure plays them, the original voices had the proper left right orientation and the DJ remix appeared dead center. With all the boom placed lower in the sound stage.Sound Stage: There are two common styles, \"You are there\" and \"They are here\".  In the first case, it feels like you are in a big auditorium sitting in the middle row. Sound comes from a distance, wide and deep sound stage. In the second case \"They are here\", it feels like musicians are sitting next to you and playing. Sound coming from close proximity. AKG is clearly the first type, Shure is not totally the second class, just a bit forward. I felt it to be lot more neutral and easy to listen with digital amps than analog amps. With AKG 702 it is easy to understand the difference between Analog and Digital, as it is dead neutral. What ever the type of amp I used, Shure always sounded forward and enforced it style. I love British/Canadian \"They are here\" style of presentation, It made it more enjoyable even with a regular consumer grade pre-amp as a headphone amplifier.It distances itself far head from other boomy head phones, when it comes to vocals. Adele, Diana, Norah voices were so lovely and soft. The drama between the soft vocals, sharp attacking drums and sweet metal strings of guitar can't be explained in words. Nothing better, than a weekend with soft lights and nice music with a proper gear. Spend a few hundred dollars on a headphone amp or use your stereo pre-amp(hopefully a dead quite one) and enjoy the headset. Shure 1440 is truly born out of love affair between strong engineering and sweet music. Worth the money spent, and most of the head phones have long life. I have had some remarkable ones for a decade without any decay. Take care and keep them safe in their case when not used. Dont bother taking them on a train or airplane, there is absolutely no external isolation."],["Every aspect of this product--from the packaging to the owner's manual to the wiring to the storage case to the actual headphones themselves--indicates the premium quality of the entire package. As a layman and avowed non-audiophile, even I can appreciate the superior sound and comfort of these headphones. Whether I'm listening to music on my iPad or watching an action-packed movie on Blu-Ray, these headphones deliver crisp, clear sound quality at any volume. And the pinch and intrusion of earbuds will be a thing of the past once you feel the insular comfort of the earpads (a second set is even included!). If you have the bucks to spare and you want to treat yourself to just about the best sound experience you can imagine, get these headphones--you will not regret it."],["I was surprised how good they sounded right out of the box. The bass is a little weak, but that is to be expected from an open-back design.After a few weeks I tested them on a Meridian Prime headphone amp and compared them to the Audeze LCD-2 and was shocked at how well they stacked up. On several songs I preferred the Shures from a sonic standpoint and on EVERY song I preferred them from a comfort standpoint. These are great if you will be wearing them for an extended period of time.Very highly recommended."],["These studio-grade headphones from Shure (SRH1440) are fantastic.  They have cast recordings that I have owned for years in a completely different light; I can hear stuff now that I never could before.  Of course, this high quality works both ways, and some of the recently remastered versions of albums recorded in the 1970s that sounded good on a pair of Bose Triports sound distorted now.I listen to progressive rock, along with some jazz and classical so I need headphones that can handle wide dynamic ranges and unusual tone colors.  The SRH1440's are more than capable of handling wide dynamic ranges (I used King Crimson's Larks Tongues in Aspic (1973) as a test) and everything sounds warm and natural.  Some of my favorite albums that sounded cramped and claustrophobic when played through the Bose Triports sound more \"open\" now and both mid range and high range frequencies are more apparent.  I thought that the bass response of the SRH1440s was pretty good; low frequencies are tight, punchy, and not boomy in the least.The SRH1440s are huge and a bit heavy but are surprisingly comfortable.  I can listen to several recordings back to back with no major discomfort or ear fatigue.  This is particularly important to me because I only listen to my music through headphones.The headphones come packaged in a large, sturdy box that contains a foam case for the headphones, extra foam pads, cables, and the owners manual.  Everything is of the highest quality.All in all, these are excellent headphones that should please even the most demanding of audiophiles."],["I went to a high-end audio shop looking for headphones. I was planning to compare the Sennheiser HD650 vs the AKG k702 headphones. They both sounded good (although the Sennheisers sounded a little \"flat\" somehow), then the salesperson suggested I try the Shure SH1840's.I was completely blown away by how much better they sounded, even from the 128kbit mp3 files I had accessible from my phone. On higher-end flac recordings they sound like magic. Classical pieces just sparkle, you can hear the individual flaws in the piano and violin, it's like listening to a live performance !Not as good on rock music, I find my ears get \"tired\" after a few hours of drum beats, but that's more likely my ears than the headphones :-).I'm not an high-end audiophile but I walked out of the shop with these headphones and haven't stopped smiling when listing to music since. Highly recommended. The salesperson did suggest a 2 week \"break-in\" period though - run them through the radio for 2 weeks to get them to the sound they'll stay with."],["The Shure SRH1440 are full-size open back headphones. According to Inner Fidelity dot com, \"Generally the best sounding headphones are in this category; and most ultra-high performance cans are of this type.\" Full-size open back headphones are of course not ideal for everyone and all situations (because of their size and the fact that they leak sound and are not noise-isolating), but if you are in the market for full-size open back headphones with low impedance (the SRH1440s have an impedance rating of 37 ohms), and you want outstanding sound and your budget allows it, do consider trying out the SRH1440s.The sound is truly awesome. The only headphones in my collection that outshine the SRH1440s are Shure's SRH1840s. When I listen to the 1440s side by side with myAKG Q701 Quincy Jones Signature Reference-Class Headphonesand my recently re-cabled and re-padded Sennheiser HD580s, I find the AKGs and Sennheisers pale by comparison. (I've made comparisons using various pieces of equipment, including a Harmon Kardon HK3370 amp/receiver, an Onkyo TX8222 amp/receiver, lossless music from a desktop run through a NuForce Icon HD USB Amp/DAC, lossless music from a laptop run through aFiiO E10 USB DAC Headphone Amplifier, and lossy music and streaming radio from an iPad both without an external amp and run through aFiiO E11 Portable Headphone Amplifier. I've tested the 1440s with classical music including opera, as well as rock and jazz, and movies with the sound run through a Sony STR DE485 amp/receiver.)I consider it a significant plus that the 1440s come with a replacement set of velour ear pads, especially given that I recently spent around fifty bills plus S&H; to replace the ear pads for the aforementioned HD580s, and if I were to replace the Q701 earpads today, it would cost me seventy bills plus S&H.; It is also a plus that the 1440s come with a replacement cable (replacing the Q701 cable today would cost me thirty three bills plus S&H;). And it is a huge plus that the 1440s come with a rugged zippered storage case with a foam cutout to hold them. (After buying the Q701s I looked for a similar type of case for them and gave up after realizing that a good quality case, such as those made by Pelican, could easily cost me as much as half what I paid for the 701s.) The case for the 1440 is identical to the case that comes with the more expensive 1840s, and has an attached zippered pouch inside it that holds both cables (i.e., the one you regularly use as well as the replacement; the cable must be removed from the headphones before the headphones can be fit into the case), as well as a threaded 1/4 inch gold-plated adapter.But back to the sound. I've heard the 1440s described as bright, and I would agree, as long as we somehow distinguish between \"bright\" and \"trebly.\" To my aging ears, headphones that are a tad bright is a good thing. I would describe the 1440s as being both bright and present. While I don't find them as neutral as I find the Q701s, they are certainly more neutral than headphones I own or have tried that emphasize the bass, so I would say that the 1440s are definitely not for anyone looking for headphones that accentuate the bass. While I of course cannot literally hear the heartbeats of musicians performing, say, a chamber piece when I listen through the 1440s, it is almost as if I can. (I listen to a talk radio show called the Philosopher's Zone that airs once a week, and when listening with the 1440s I could hear things I'd never heard so much as a suggestion of when I've listened to the show with other headphones, such as movements of the host's chair, and the sound of the host sipping a beverage when his guest was speaking. It was as if I was in his broadcasting studio with him.)When I listen to recordings of live music with the 1440s I can close my eyes and it is as if I am in the concert hall or club or whatever venue the music was performed in. It's not as if I have to imagine that I'm in the live venue; it's as if I am literally in it. The depth, soundscape and presence of the 1440s are nothing short of remarkable. I've listened to the 1440s for hours at a time with zero fatigue, something I cannot say about any other headphones I've used with the exception of Shure's SRH1840s. But I did find that I had to become accustomed to wearing them, as they are not so lightweight as to be unnoticeable (in contrast, the Q701s and 1840s seem to float on my head), but once I found the right adjustment for my head, their presence there became unobtrusive. Conveniently, the metal part of the headband that is exposed when you adjust the headphones has numbers on it so you can adjust each side to the same indent each time once you find the setting that works best for your noggin. Inconveniently, Shure did not provide a way for 1440 users to \"braille\" their way to determine which side is left and which is right, as one may need to do if using the headphones in the dark. Because the cable attaches to both earpieces one cannot determine which side is which in the way one can with a single-sided cable, and unlike the Sennheiser HD580s, which also have a double-sided cable, there is no \"braille\" type marking on one side that one can feel. However, because the Shure name is printed in a slightly indented way on the top of the headband, I can determine which side is left by feeling for the curve of the \"S\" in \"Shure.\"By all means check out Dale Thorn's excellent \"Shure SRH-1440 Stereo Headphone Review by Dale\" in Stereophile's forum as well as his YouTube video titled, \"Shure SRH-1440 Brightness Modification Review by Dale.\"Finally, if you are considering purchasing the 1440s as a gift for someone, you could not select a more impressively packaged gift, as the fairly huge, handsome box they come in exclaims quality, class and refinement, as do the contents."],["The Shure SRH1440 Headphones are good headphones.They are not \"blow-you-away\" headphones that \"immerse you in an ocean of deep and rich sounds,leaving their competitors on the dust\", or other such superlative audiophile reviewer babble... no...but they are simply good, quality headphones.  I found them to be acceptable.  I am keeping them.Here is the back story:Earlier this week, I ordered and received the $180-more-expensive (nearly $500) Sennheiser HD 650headphones.  I was impressed by their almost unanimously great reviews.I found the Sennheiser HD 650 to be totally unacceptable for two reasons:1.) The HD 650 was very uncomfortable - like a tight vice grip on my head.2.) The HD 650 has a whopping 300 ohms of impedance, which to my surprise, I discovered wastoo much impedance / resistance even for my $250 TEAC model UD-H01 D.A.C. - Headphone Amp Unit tobe able to power them beyond just a moderate volume level.So, I returned the HD 650, and instead I ordered and received the Shure SRH1440 Headphones.They were much less expensive (at $300), and much more comfortable on my head,and because their impedance is only 37 ohms... which is about ONE-TENTH of the HD 650's 300 ohms...I was able to power them with my TEAC model UD-HO1 Digital-Analog-Converter - Headphone Amp Unit.The Shure SRH1440 headphones have very comfortable and soft velour cloth ear pads(a better choice than genuine or fake leather, as velour cloth breathes well against your skin).They are not too tight, not too loose, very flexible and adjustable... easy to fit to your head.They produce a nice balanced sound... not too full of bass... not too full of treble...(though if you have an old-school equalizer like I do, that is easily adjustable to suit your taste anyway).I did not like that the cord is only 2.1 meters (6.9 feet) long, as I could have ideally used justan extra foot or two... but I can make that work for me.  I did not like that the cord has a cheap,thin, rubber-coated, strangely \"bendy / bouncy\" quality to it, rather than being a cord that drapesdown more smoothly and uniformly, as it should.  That being said... it is a very lightweight cordthat does not tangle and does not weigh you down... and both ends are gold-plated... so it is acceptable to me.It is unexpected and generous of Shure that they also provide SRH1440s buyers with a second set of cords,and a second set of velour ear-pads... so you can swap-out your cords and ear pads in a few years,when your first sets gets old, and you then have the feel of a new set of headphones... that was thoughtful.You also get a semi-rigid carrying case.  You also get an adapter to convert the tiny 3.5 mm termination jack(which fits into an iPod / iPhone / iPad etc.) into a 1/4 inch classic big headphone jack such as thosefound on most home audio components, receivers, and headphone amps.In closing... I would like to point out one thing, on a related note, concerning what Ilearned this week about the required amplification of a good set of headphones:Although these Shure SRH1440 headphones, at just 37 ohms of impedance,are able to achieve a higher volume level than the Sennhesier HD 650's withtheir crazy-high 300 ohms of impedance... I still found that my new TEAC headphone ampwas only able to power these low-impedance Shure 1440s headphones to what I wouldcall a \"moderately loud\" listening level, if I turned the headphone amp's volume controlall the way up to 100%.  That's loud enough for me... but it might not quite be loud enoughfor some people.Apparently, in order to get really good (distortion free) somewhat high volume out of good headphones,you really need to buy a high-end, very powerful headphone amp, capable of delivering morepower than my $250 headphone amp / DAC combo unit is capable of delivering.I found that discovery to be very surprising.  That's not the fault of these headphones... but it issomething that the buyer of quality headphones should keep in mind.  A powerful headphone ampis necessary to realize the full potential of quality headphones.Happy listening!"],["The headphones arrived in an impressively large 1 foot square box.  Inside you get a molded case containing the headphones and a pair of 2.1m cord.  You also get an extra set of velour ear pads and a second set of cords.  Construction and design appears pretty good.  The head band is made of spring steel, the top part is wrapped in leather padding.  The ear cups are made of plastic.  The open back design is very cool and modern looking.  There's black mesh in the back and you get full view of the driver.  The ear pads are made of velour (my personal preference) and is very comfortable.  The cord is detachable and snaps firmly into place.  I didn't have any problems with the cord falling out.  The cord themselves appears a bit underwhelming in terms of appearance.  My similarly priced Denon 7000 has much more substantial cords.  Overall, the headset is extremely light, probably one of my lightest sets.  The spring tension is right on and easy to adjust.  This is my most comfortable set of headphones.Sound quality is very, very good.  Perhaps the best way to describe the sound is to compare it to a very similar design, the familiar AKG 702.  Both are open back over ear headphones.  Right off the bat, the Shure is much more efficient and therefore easier to drive than the AKG.  The AKG is known for its extremely wide sound stage and amazingly detailed mids.  I'd say that the sound stage for the Shure is very good, but not as good as the AKG.  The mids and highs are not as pristine and detailed as the AKG.  Very close, but side to side comparison, the AKG is noticeably better.  What the AKG lack is bass, and the Shure is clearly an improvement here.My overall impression is that this is a well made, well designed set that is extremely comfortable.  The sound excel in it's balance.  Not great in any given aspect, but very good in all."],["I'm no headphone expert, but I've never in my life heard music sound as gorgeous as it does on these--rich, nuanced, and beautifully layered and clear. I'm able to hear instrumentation and detail I never made out before in years of playing various artists; it's like having them suddenly right here with me performing in my head. It makes me want to listen to every piece I've ever loved to discover and enjoy all the little riffs and tones, all the artistry and complexity, that's been escaping me. My husband feels the same way.Of course, these headphones cost five times more than the best we've previously used, but at the moment I rather impulsively think (having not shopped around and also having been given these by the Vine program) that the comfort, sound, and quality make them worth every penny. You get a beautiful, sturdy zippered case with foam lining, which looks like it could retail for $35-$45 on its own, as well as two dual-exit detachable cables, one pair of replacement velour ear-pads, and a quarter-inch threaded gold-plated adapter. I can't say how these stack up against other similarly priced 'professional' headphones, but they make all the $30-$100 kinds I've used before seem practically worthless. Though I like to be thrifty, these strike me as the kind of product where spending more might actually be worth it because they give you a better value and incomparably superior experience.It would of course still be good to listen to different makes and models to see what different prices (and not just a lot or a little) offer, but it's hard to imagine many people who'd be disappointed with the sound of these. The only thing I don't like about them is the somewhat perfume-y scent in the velour and the foam, but that's undetectable when I have the earphones on. There is a two-year warranty for defects in materials and workmanship to the original purchaser."],["The Shure 1440 stereo headphones are an audiophile's delight. I've been comparing it with Sony and Bose headphones I have used for years, and there is definitely much greater clarity in sound quality than I have heard from the others. I've been using the Shure on a pocket Sony radio, a BOSE CD player, and on my Dell XPS laptop, and have obtained excellent results each and every time. The Shure headphones have provided me with exceptionally high quality in sound, even at a deeper pitched \"bass\" level. I will admit that this is by far the most expensive set of headphones I have ever acquired, but the superb sound quality as well as the high degree of durability does justify its high cost, which also includes an extra set of dual-exit detachable cables and replacement earpads and a quarter-inch threaded gold-plated adaptor for the detachable cables to connect to audio equipment that have quarter-inch headset/microphone openings. It doesn't matter if you are hearing a CD of orchestral classical music, or watching the video of a rock band, these headphones are well worth the investment."],["This review is for the 1440 model.  I have used these headphones for about a year off and on.  I much prefer my Vandersteen 3a Signature speakers, but my listening room is just below the master bedroom, so when my wife goes to bed, so must the Vandersteens.  The 1440's are a far cry from the basic Koss headphones of 50 years ago that I used.  The fit is comfortable for headphones.  The sound is very refined with a pretty decent bottom end than is well-defined (not boomy).  I'm a classical musician turned psychiatrist, and I am still quite particular about ALL of the frequency range contained on CD's.  If a headphone can pass the classical music test, it should be able to reproduce anything.  Although the phones use plastic, they seem very well made.  I am glad to see that Shure hasn't gone the way of other manufactures and begun cutting corners.  Highly Recommended."],["First impression on these is the QUALITY.  The box they come in is very professionally manufactured with a glossy surface of the box and a ribbon pull tab to open.  There inside you find a black case that stores the headphones.  There are both 1/4 and 1/8 adapters as well as 2 dis-connectable cords for the headphones.  This is a nice feature, as we all have had cords that short, tear, fray, etc.  This allows you to connect your back up set and keep rocking.  The case is closed with a zipper, and there is a pocket inside the case for storing the extra cords and adapters.  The case is a hard, yet flexible, black fabric feeling case with a handle.The sound quality is immediately noticeable.  Open back headphones are my favorite as they allow the speakers inside the headphones to breathe naturally as they vibrate when producing the sound.  This is unlike ear buds or closed back (even noise cancelling) headphones where the internal components are sealed inside the casing.  The vibrations are more natural thus allowing the deep bass to really come alive.  Also the high ends of the frequencies are crisp, so the dynamics are amazing as you can imagine.  When you adjust your own EQ settings to your liking, then these headphones are really impressive.I would say that the one drawback with these headphones is the size.  They are quite big.  They aren't heavy, but they are bulky.  Not ideal for using while being active.  They are more for when you want a good set of headphones to listen casually in your home.  They are well padded for comfort, and they come with extra cushions for when you need to replace them after wearing them out from use.NOTE: I am very fussy when it comes to headphones.  I only use the Apple ear buds while working out.  When I listen to music, I prefer nice open back headphones.  My brand of choice has been Grado Labs.  I compared these Shure headphones to the Grado Labs.  I used with my iPod, iPhone and stereo receiver for comparison."],["These headphomnes are impressively packaged, in a shiny, black box. Inside are a owners manual, a nice hardshell case, all the wiring with impressive gold details, and extra felt earpads. I tried them with my iPad, iPod, and my radio on the nightstand. The sound can't be beat. I have tried so many brands of headphones and earbuds in all price ranges, and these had the best sound quality of all (No, have not tried Bose). I heard notes in some of my music that I had never noticed before.I only gave them four stars because, ebven though the earpads are extremely comfortable, I found the weight of these headphones hurt my neck after awhile. Men might not notice this, but if you are buying these for a wife, girlfriend, or daughter, it could be an issue. Also, the size of the case, and the headphones themselves, would make these only a good choice for home use. They are much too large, as is the case, to be portable. I can't see these fitting in any handbag or briefcase."],["I auditioned the SRH-1840 straight out of the box, and was unsatisfied with the sound, so I decided to give them a period of break-in.  Recent scientific studies have shown definite differences between new headphones and used headphones in frequency response.  Of course, \"better\" is a subjective impression outside the realm of science, but the studies confirm that reviewers are not imagining things.I tried them again after about 20 hours of break-in and there was definite improvement in several areas of sound quality.  So, I continued the break-in process. I finally ended up with about 100 hours of break-in and I have to say that it sounds to me that the break-in made a difference all the way through the process. The bass quality and quantity are both significantly improved, all shrillness and edginess to the treble has vanished, and everything is quite smooth now.Meanwhile, one problem I've had is that the headband/earpiece fit was not particularly good for me. I tried various adjustments of the headband and ear pieces, but nothing helped significantly.  Note this is not a \"comfort\" problem.  I'll say here that these headphones have above-average comfort - although part of that might be due to the clamping force being actually less than what would be optimal.  They are also relatively light in weight for full size headphones.Anyway, I've found that I can move the ear cups around on my ears with my hands and sporadically hear sound improvement, confirming my impression that there is something not quite right with the \"fit\" - again, this is the placement of drivers for sound quality (as opposed to comfort).Then, I found a thread on the big headphone forum of a mod for the SRH-940, and since it was easy and non-destructive, I tried it on the SRH-1840 (using a paper towel aince I am out of cotton balls).  To read the thread, type head-fi.org into your browser's address box and then paste in the following at the end of that:/t/591325/how-to-hi-end-ify-your-srh940All I can say is - OMG - all of my list of \"disadvantages of the SRH-1840\" vanished. The bass quantity is now certainly at least equal to that of other high end phones. The already impressive imaging improved further, and the audibility of hall sound and ambience improved as well.The original strong points of excellent timbre accuracy and even balance of all frequencies are even better now with the mod.Okay, I can say that if I were making a purchase decision based on the out-of-the-box sound quality (before break-in), I would make the wrong decision, so I think that Shure (and other makers) should consider in-house break-in for this price range of product.So, I strongly recommend:- 100 hours of break-in (with about 20 hours a absolute minimum)- Apply the mod in the thread linked above (the material used should be to your preference, I don't think it matters) unless you feel that the fit and sound are already just right.The following evaluation is based on the results after both.Pros:* Excellent  instrument timbre accuracy (what makes a sax sound different than a guitar).  If the recording is good, instruments are very close to their real sound.* Excellent balance of frequencies (bass, midrange and treble). You never get the sense that there is too much of any particular frequency, in other words, it never seems overly bright, or recessed, or overly bassy - unless, of course, the actual recording is that way.* Excellent clarity and detail* Very good low end extension* Treble is strong without being annoying or overly bright* Imaging is outstanding ; you can pick out individual instrument positions and there is a three-dimensional quality to the instrument positions. For example, in the first BVSC track, you can hear a musician move his percussion instrument to a spot a foot away.  Note that this is not the same quality as soundstage size or depth - both of those are good, but not excellent - the Senn HD5xx series are better in this respect due to their slightly forward driver position.  My guess is that the matched drivers of the SRH-1840 are what makes the imaging so good.* Excellent for a wide range of music types. As you can see from the tracks listed at the end, I verified that these have good sound quality with any music style.* Very good comfort - should not be a problem for most listening sessions.* Usable with portable devices - the 65 ohm impedance, and 96 dB/mW sensitivity both work fine with portables (unless they have unusually low output)* Foam padded hard shell case which protects the headphone in transport.* Beautiful storage box which keeps the headphones and accessories together.* Spare cable and spare ear pads included - you should not need to order anything for a long time, if ever.* Clever plug design which has the smaller ipod/ipad size plug inside a 1/4\" plug that screws over the smaller one - this provides rigidity when using the larger size, and avoids having to use a bulky adapter when listening through a portable device.Cons;* The headband and ear piece adjustments are minimal ; my guess is that this provides rigidity which would then help with detail and imaging ; but as a result, it does not adjust easily for a wide variety of head shapes and sizes.  You may not have any problem if your head is similar to what was used in the design of the headphone.  And, the mod suggested above may help -  it has for me and others.  Also, in this price range, I strongly suggest contacting Shure directly if you can use some assistance - I find that many audio manufacturers are more responsive than people think.* Small amount of sibilance in vocals ; in comparison to Infinity Emit tweeters that go up to 40khz but do not have the same sibilance ; probably due to small frequency spike in the vocal range.* Not as much bass \"slam\" or impact as those headphones that have that as one of their selling points ; but not entirely deficient in bass impact either.  (After break-in period and proper \"fit\" - in my case using the mod - bass quantity and quality is otherwise fine.)* Cable is slightly short for use with a \"desktop\" amp and is slightly long for use with portables.  (Senn solves this problem by making the cable shorter and including an extension.)* Cable is double entry, instead of the more convenient single entry.  This is the accepted style for high end headphones, in order to make both wires the same length.  However, that can be accomplished within the headphones while still using a single entry point, but using a wholly exterior cord allows for aftermarket audiophile replacement cables  So, this is a minus in terms of convenience and ease of use, but I suppose could be a plus later for those who want to buy expensive high end replacement cables, if and when they appear for this model.* Padded hard shell case requires the cable be removed, which not only takes time, but also might eventually wear out the connections. You can put them in the case with the cable attached, but you have to reverse the phones and gather the cable and put it in the zippered pouch with the cable sticking out - it is a \"kluge\" but works, but it seems clear that no one has thought of this issue.* Instructions - as with all our full size headphones I've used - say nothing about using the headphones. From above, there is clearly more to the fit than just \"put them on your end and put the plug in the jack\", but that is the clear assumption.  In contrast, Shure's $99 SE215 in-ear-monitor phones come up with extensive instrunctions on wearing and fitting them.  For this product, the big manual seems entirely for legal disclaimers.  For $699, it would be good to have some suggestion from the designers as to how your ears should fit in the ear pieces, and how to adjust them for best sound and fit.Conclusion - If you can get the fit right, this is an outstanding sounding product that is very neutral.  Unfortunately, I do not have any of the competing products in this price range, so I cannot directly compare them.  (But I would be happy to review and compare those other competing models, if reps want to send me temporary loan pairs.)Album/tracks used in evaluation:The Beatles - Complete 2009 Remasters in 24-bit formatAlison Krauss & Union Station - Paper Airplane (hdtracks)Miles Davis - Kind of Blue SACDPink Floyd - Dark Side of the Moon (MFSL CD)N.W.A. - Straight Outta Compton (20th Anniversary)Mozart - Violin Concertos (Marianne Thorsen) (hdtracks)Galactic - Crazyhorse MongooseMozart - Sinfonia concertante (Julia Fischer) (hdtracks)Andreas Vollenweider - White WindsDerek and the Dominos - Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs (hdtracks)Buena Vista Social Club - Buena Vista Social Club (hdtracks)Opus 3 Test Record \"Depth of Image\"Previous headphones owned (not used in this review): Sennheiser HD590, HD518, HD449, HD424x, RS180, CX300II, Shure SE215, AKG K240DFEquipment used: Custom built home theater PC using cPlay audiophile music player and HRT MusicStreamer II asynchronous DAC (an excellent product and outstanding value available here on Amazon) directly into the headphones (due to the relatively high output of that DAC).Experience - I have a diploma (and license) in studio audio engineering, and have been an audiophile and music lover since I was a teenager.  I have also worked at all levels of record retailing, and have participated in music performance."],["Right out of the gate, I'm sure I'm going to get slammed because I've formed this review without first shelling out hundreds of dollars for the right. Fair enough, I suppose.If you're still reading, my \"daily drivers\" are Shure SE535-V IEM's, I know my way around a soundboard, and I can (hopefully) pull off a headphone review without sounding like a faux audiophile.For those not used to Shure products, the SRH1840's continue Shure's unwritten edict that higher-end products must sound as neutral as possible. These aren't going to make your teeth rattle with bass, and they're not going to make Taylor Swift actually appear in your living room with the amazing way they reproduce highs. They will, however, give a faithful reproduction of the music you want to hear -- with some caveats:1: Holy crap, are these ever power-hungry! Whatever your not-amplifier is pushing isn't nearly enough to drive these. Even with an 18V CMoy amp, I was checking my battery life every so often. Sure, anything in this range \"should\" be amplified, but the 1840's aren't even passable unamplified.2: Garbage in, garbage out. If your source material wasn't mastered well, you're going to hear it. If your digital collection is optimized for space and your car stereo, you're going to hear it. While you'll be able to hear subtle breaths and picks hitting strings with the 1840's, you're also going to hear sloppy audio engineering from the studio, cheap recording equipment, and so on.3: Despite Shure being a brand that professionals use, the packaging you see here seems to be more for consumers. More on that in a second...OVERALL IMPRESSIONSPlacebo effect or not, I did an overnight pink noise break-in, after a few minutes of unimpressive casual listening. I can't say it was a massive difference, and throughout my evaluation, I found that the 1840's are unforgiving about where the source comes from. At times, I was too busy regretting how I had ripped some of my CD's, instead of enjoying the actual music.Sound reproduction was typical of Shure, in that nothing appeared to be added or taken away. It's classic Shure in being totally flat across the spectrum. Shure reports, you decide. If you're of the \"more expensive = more bass\" school of thought, these will thoroughly disappoint.Jazz, folk, vocal, symphonic and other acoustic instruments all sounded wonderful. Drifting in to more electrified genres was more of a mixed bag, however. Metric and Shiny Toy Guns sound decent, but The Postal Service and Skrillex may sound better on some cheaper Beats by Dr. Dre, or even higher-end Sony headphones.COMFORTWithout question, these are the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn. Ever. I've worn them for hours with no fatigue, and despite their size, they almost feel natural.The headband doesn't pinch, and the generous padding brilliantly distributes pressure. The ear foams don't get hot, yet fit very well around my ears. Everything stays put with movement. If I was rating these on comfort alone, they'd get a solid five stars. If these weren't open-back, I'd probably use them exclusively (you're welcome, co-workers).PACKAGINGAs with anything toward the top of Shure's range, you get a fancy-pants box that isn't very practical (same goes for the aluminum cube IEM's come in, for example) and some accessories.A critical consumer should probably be thinking \"I wonder how much of the price I paid went in to producing this stuff I don't want or need right now?\" rather than \"Hey! Shure gave me all sorts of cool free stuff I wasn't expecting!\" A not insubstantial amount of money has been invested in the \"extras\", and that money used to belong to you. And in spite of the \"professional\" references, I can almost promise you that there isn't an audio engineer in a studio anywhere thanking his or her lucky stars that these new headphones come with an extra cable.CONCLUSIONThe Shure 1840's are designed for a very narrow range of consumers. They're no friend to pop fans looking for the best of what's around. On the other hand, they'd be very, very welcome in the hands of anyone who appreciates Jazz and / or Folk. Not to mention an excellent choice for anyone who wants or needs to be able to do truly critical listening.The build quality and comfort is absolutely top-notch, making them a joy to wear.While it's easy to glow about the 1840's, there are issues. The superfluous packaging really concerns me. If they had dropped the \"extras\" and reduced the price by 15%, I could see a five-star product all day long.-[Test Arsenal]-SOURCES:Lenovo ThinkPad W520Apple iPod Classic 160 GBZune HD 64 GBAudio Technica ATLP120Yamaha RX-V667Biosciencegeek CMoy (18V mod) amplifier on and off of all devices, except YamahaARTIST - TRACK - ORIGINAL SOURCE / DEVICE TESTED*Weather Report - Birdland - CD/ YamahaChecked the amp to make sure treble wasn't maxed, or that I wasn't inadvertently using a weird sound field.

The box the Shure SRH1840 Professional Open Back Headphones came in was impressive indeed. About a foot square, made of very heavy board with great graphics. Inside were the headphones, a user's manual in a sleeve on the box lid, two nearly 7-foot cords, a mini to \" adaptor, an extra set of velour ear pads and a custom molded hard shell case to carry it all.  All the components of the package are professional quality with top dollar oxygen free copper wire, gold plated connectors and Kevlar casings. This is the top of the Shure line and they've pulled out all the stops on these very impressive cans.The build quality of the 1840s is first rate. They are tight, light and strong. Each transition from one material to another is trimmed and/or tucked. The earpad adjustments are smooth and easy to pull, but hold tightly once released. The cord jacks offer up a very satisfying \"snap\" when the plugs hit bottom.The SRH1840s are, by far, the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn.  Some high-end over the ear cans press so firmly against the ear that they become uncomfortable in a very short time. These are light as air and are as easy on the outside of the ear as on the inside. I have worn them for three hours straight with no discomfort at all. I worked as a radio announcer for years and the plastic ultra light Sennheiser on-the-ear phones we used then were no more comfortable than these.After burning in the headphones for about 12-hours I hooked them up to my JDs Labs cMoyBB v2.03 Headphone Amplifier (built into an empty Altoids box) and several devices around the house, including a 4th generation iPod Touch and a Pioneer Elite SC-35. While the sound output of the devices of course varies considerably, the quality of each was vastly improved with these headphones.  I found the sound of the 1840s to be phenomenal.The high end is crisp and tight with no clangy sharpness. The bass is deep and full, with a well delineated cut-off that makes for a clean \"physical\" approach that's easy to find in a good speaker, but much more elusive in headphones.  The mids are where the 1840s really shine for me. Since much of my listening is vocal pop and non-thunderous rock I always look for midrange that's out front and makes its presence known without being clunky.  These headphones are a classic rockers dream (and the bass boost on the cMoyBB v2.03 doesn't hurt either).I have noticed that the more I listen, the warmer and more precise the headphones sound. I think I will take the advice of one of the other reviewers and give the 1840s a longer burn-in period.  I am not one of the ultra high end audiophiles who don't bat an eye at spending over a thousand bucks on a set of headphones, but I do care about the sound of my music. I have to think these Shure SRH1840s would stand up well against cans of any pedigree or price."],["Im using a ResonEssence Concero HP  and a Woo Audio Fireflies to listen to them.They are slightly brighter regarding their upper midrange and overall presentation then Shure SRH 940s, NAD Viso 50s,  Senn 551s or 600s, AKG 702s or 712s, or Beyerdynamic DT 770s or DT 880s.Or KEF M500s, or ThinkSound ON1s, or Focal Spirt Pros, or HIFi Man HE-400s or the new PSBs.The Shure SHR-1840 also sound better then any of those headphone in the list tho the KEF M500s and the HIFI Man H400s are also excellent and comparable, but not as transparent or balanced.The sound of the SRH-1840 phones, to my ear, has been definitely finessed around the 3-5Hhz frequency so that you get stunning details and articulation.Guitars, vocals, cymbals, snare, bass, violin....all benefit from the  upper midrange  bump that impressively increases clarity.Incredible clarity, oh yes.The (mid) mids are ok and unrestricted, and the bass extension and detail is slightly above average.The SHR-1840s are great  sounding headphones.  Their comfort level is excellent, build quality is very good, box and accessories are nice.These headphones are all about  presenting outstanding overall clarity  and balance which they absolutely do provide.Before you reach deep into your Pockets for the Beyer Tesla T-1 or the Senn HD-800 or the HIFI H-600  or the AKG K-812 , you should definitely try these first.They really are special."],["These are, without doubt, the best as well as most expensive set of earphones I have ever used. I've used multiple different headsets and have given up on the miserable discomfort of in-ear headphones. I have never found an in-ear set that was comfortable for more than a few minutes. This set of headphones come as close to perfection as possible, both in function and construction, for this non-professional musicphile and I feel that I am rediscovering the music that I have been listening to for years.Sound: I used the headset with my Sony Reciever and Sony CD Player and the sound was simply out of this world. Besides hearing details in the music that I had been missing for so long, the headset gives you the feeling of being actually on the stage with the performers. It is hard to explain the immediacy of the music and the clean quality of the sound. The bass is smooth and pronounced without the thumping quality that some headphones seem to add on. The open back to the ear pads may help with this - I'm not really sure. All I can say is that the sound comes the closest to the sound you get in perfect seats in a concert - be it classical, rock or contemporary.Use: I would not bother trying these on your ipod or portable music player. I did read somewhere that an amp would improve the quality if you do choose to do this but I found that the quality of the player damped down the quality of the headphones and were a complete waste of time. If you like to listen to the majority of your music on your ipod you may need to look further into this. However, if you like to sit in a quiet room to absorb your favorite music played on a decent piece of equipment, these are seriously perfect! I can totally see my octogenarian, opera-loving relatives falling in love with these.Fit and Comfort: These are not tiny headphones. They are very light and well built but they are big. Usually at this size I find that the headphones either ride on the top of my head (read : future headache) or clamp down on my ears like a vise (ditto). These do neither. The ear pads themselves do not flex and swivel as many headsets do but they are surprisingly comfortable. The velour pads instead of fake leather are a wonderful idea (unless you plan on sharing with other sweaty humans) and, due to the open mesh design, heat does not build up behind them. The unit comes with spare pads and I am guessing you can wash these in gentle soap if needed.Use in Public Places: The open mesh backs of the ear pads do mean that you cannot turn the volume up while using these without the people around you hearing a little of what you are hearing as well. So not perfect for listening in a crowded environment. Also, the open mesh means that you can hear what is being said around you - so no blocking out your children and spouses with these! Or the cranky man in the seat next to you on the overcrowded plane.  For the past few years I have been unable to hear a thing said on the in-flight movies (using the measly ear buds airplanes provide) and would guess that these would solve that problem in a flash. However, their size as well as the fact that the sound is heard by those around you makes these unsuitable for planes. Besides that, they come in a massive padded case (the price merits a protective case) that would probably take up a third of your carry on so don't count on these for those long flights.In sum, if you love music, are considering these headphones and are questioning whether the price is worth it, all I can say is, YES! Do go out and try these out to see for yourself. I have no doubts that a few minutes of using them and these amazing headphones will sell themselves !"],["These Shure SRH1840 Open Back Headphones are by far the best pair that I have for listening to music at home. They are sturdy, attractive, extremely comfortable and the sound quality is superb--everything that you would expect of headphones in this range.Mies van der Rohe would appreciate the straightforward yet refined design. Function was definitely the primary factor in choice of materials and methods of construction (with the possible exception of the jaunty silver metal trim) but the understated finishes and tactile qualities are still luxurious.The earcups are generously-sized with plush cushions. They are slightly angled forward, pivot about fifteen degrees, and the headband is very flexible. There are two strips of padding along the headband. Overall weight is under ten ounces. These characteristics make them very pleasurable to wear even for many hours at a time, with minimal pressure, heat, and moisture.The sound quality of the SRH1840 headphones is superb regardless of music genre. Listening to them for the first time is quite an experience. The wide-open spatial ambiance and soundstage are initially most noticeable. After adjusting to that, the exceptional accuracy and fine detail become apparent. It is necessary to listen to many different kinds of music to fully appreciate how balanced they are along the full spectrum from low bass to high treble. To my ear, there is no particular aspect of the sound that requires qualification or critical comment.There are some caveats. These headphones are not really intended for listening on the go with an iWhatever. The cable is thick and just under seven feet long, intended to be plugged into stationary equipment next to a comfortable chair. An amplifier is really necessary to experience what these headphones are capable of doing. They are best suited for a quiet environment because of the open backs. The sound reproduction is accurate and perception will depend on the electronics and the inherent qualities of the music itself. Poor or old recordings, low quality sound files, or underpowered MP3 players will cause noticeable defects. Familiar music will seem different and it takes the ears and brain a while to acclimate.These Shure SRH1840s have spoiled my ears for lesser headphones. They are so comfortable and the sound is so very natural that I forget that I am wearing headphones and can just enjoy listening to music for several hours at a time, When the construction down the block gets noisy and I have to switch to closed headphones or when I am out walking with earphones, I certainly notice and regret the difference."],["The Shure SRH1840 Professional Open Back Headphones are the flagship model for Shure and that designation is both accurate and well deserved.  I am a \"quasi-audiophile\" and I split my available disposable income between both audio and video systems, constantly trying to improve things on a somewhat limited budget.  While these SRH1840's are not inexpensive, they are very reasonably priced in the grand scheme of things and an overall great value!Let's talk about what you get!These Shure cans come in a very hefty/sturdy box and it is doubtful they will be damaged during shipment so rest assured when buying online.  In addition to the phones, Shure is thoughtful enough to include a true wealth of small extras. Stuff you can actually USE and over time WILL be needing.  How about an extra cable? Plus these cable are not el-cheapos in any way. They are the real deal, 100% oxygen free copper wire covered with Kevlar and terminated with gold plated jacks and almost 7 ft. long. Nice! Of course the necessary jack adapter is also included so you can connect to either a mini phone jack or a 1/4 inch.  Add to that an extra pair of super cushy velour ear pads and a nice looking soft carrying case.  After purchasing multiple headphones over the last few years, it is a breath of fresh air to see these top flight extras included. Just the cabling alone can retail separately for upwards of $100.  Nice one Shure!!First off and VERY IMPORTANT, these cans DO require a \"burn-in\" period.  I suggest connecting them to a portable sound source and let them play for a good 6 or 7 days straight with music set on an infinite loop while gradually increasing the volume each day until you reach your optimal listening level. Rest them every now and then and then start again. The drivers NEED to loosen up and settle in. Any critical listening done before this may prove to be unsatisfying. Once they are burned in, the  1840's  positively SHINE in every way that is important to me.  Believe me, the difference before and after is dramatic and you don't want to spend this much money and then shortchange yourself.  I can tell you that after only ONE day of burn in , the sound dramatically improved! Bass was deeper, louder AND tighter, mids smoothed out and started to breathe, and highs took on a transparent quality while still being very present.  The more burn in the better!  If you simply MUST listen to them right away, when you are done make sure and keep the burn in process going. Do yourself a favor!The build quality of these Shure 1840's is excellent.  Solid construction that provides both a pleasing product to look at and durability for many years to come.  Let's talk about comfort here.  I have a rather large head and found my Sennheiser 650's akin to wearing a vise. OUCH! This is NOT the case with the 1840's.  While they are snug, they do not squeeze me to the point of being uncomfortable or painful.  A good solid seal is needed, especially with open back phones to provide the intended frequency response but these Shure cans do it with a minimum of discomfort and I was able to sit and listen for 2 hours or so before wanting to take a break.  Long enough for a movie or 2 or 3 albums worth.  The ear pads are nice and comfy. They are not quite as comfy as the Beyer 990's (which are the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn) but they are close and they sound MANY times better!If anything, my only two suggestions would be NOT to paint on the \"L\" & \"R\" silk screening as that is going to be the first thing to wear off. A more permanent way of marking L&R; would have been better. Also, the headband, while comfy and very nice looking appears to not have quite as much padding as I would like to see for durability and honestly it along with the ear pads will be the first things that need to be replaced on these.The cable , while high quality , is not stiff at all but very pliable and manageable.  It is not obtrusive in any way while listening and inserting the cable jacks into the phones is simple, attaching with a satisfying \"click\" to let you know they are anchored in place.My previous experience with higher end headphone ownership includes both the 600 and the 650 from Sennheiser , the AKG 701's and the Beyer Dynamic 990's.  I have consistently tried to find ONE  set of headphones that would allow me to listen to all my favorite music and experience pleasing tonal/frequency response with it all. This is not as easy as it sounds. Many folks have multiple pairs of headphones to accomplish this.  Perhaps the 650's for Classical, a pair of mid level Grado's for classic rock and maybe the AKG's for vocal pop.So , do the 1840's cover all my bases? I can give you a three word answer to that. yes..Yes...and a resounding YES!  The Shure 1840's are the best overall sounding headphones I have ever owned.  I perceive the bass response to be as clean and articulated (and deeper) as my 650s' with no flabbiness , the Mids to be as detailed and present as the AKG's and being just a bit forward, but not pushy in any way AND a high end that is neither 'veiled' like the Sennheisers, or sharp and brittle like the Grado's.  Listener fatigue is virtually nonexistent and the overall 'voicing' of these cans is exactly to my liking.  Everything has a very refined, almost crystalline quality to it and at the same time the sound is very dynamic and alive.  The soundstage is massive, in part to the open air design. I don't want to sound like a cake commercial, but the mids, once the cans are broken in, posses a large amount of silky lushness and transparent sheen. These are decidedly NON technical terms, but when I listen to the Beatles in 24 bit that is what comes to mind. Yeah yeah yeah !Everyone hears things differently. Some swear by Grado and can't stand anything else, while others refuse to listen on anything but their 600's or 650's.  Sound and the way we all perceive it can vary widely between the people hearing it.  If you have a high frequency hearing loss for whatever reason, Grado's might be right for you.  If your main musical tastes are classical, you could do a lot worse than a nice pair of Sennheiser 650's. For me, I listen to a ton of vocal pop and classic non heavy metal rock.  The Shure 1840's provide me with pure listening satisfaction for these genres and DO seem to shine for my orchestral albums and 60's classics as well and bring a whole new dimension to my ELO/Jeff Lynne collection while rocking hard with Toto, harder than they actually rocked!  For me, they are a \"do it all\" headphone and I am putting my 650's up for sale and 'lifting that veil' once and for all.If you are planning to use these for your portable player, don't. They are overkill for that particular application, they are hard to drive by i Pods and being an open ear design everyone will hear your music and you will hear most everything they are doing and saying. These cans are best suited for the music lover who listens at home and in quiet surroundings.As with any set of speakers or headphones, I strongly recommend the prospective purchaser find a way to TRY them out before buying. My ears are not your ears and tastes also vary widely.  But if you primarily like 60's vocal pop  *(Beatles, British Invasion, Beach Boys )and more \"Middle of the Road\" rock (such as Toto, ELO, etc) I think it is a safe bet you will REALLY enjoy these cans.  For me, my search is finally over for now and I can just kick back and enjoy the music!Thank you Shure! In my opinion these are overall the best headphone value for under a thousand dollars.  Highly recommended!"],["I use headphones on an almost daily basis, as I share my house with a renter that keeps a completely different schedule than I do. So while I do use headphones for listening to music, I also use them frequently for watching TV, movies, etc. I usually use a set of wireless headphones that let me move around freely, but given a chance to try out these high-end phones, I was excited to see how they compared.Trying them on for the first time, the first thing I noticed was the comfort level. I have a lot of trouble wearing headphones, partly due to wearing eyeglasses, and these are definitely the most comfortable I've worn, light and easy to wear for extended periods. I can (and do) wear these all day with little fatigue.The sound quality as well was immediately obvious when compared to the wireless ones. When watching movies in particular, I was really impressed with the fuller sound, and details that just get lost with the wireless set. Even watching TV, I greatly enjoyed using these for watching my favorites sports, the feel of being right there was clearly superior.If I could come up with any complaint, it would have to be the silly carry case for them. It seems like a frivolous waste that of course is reflected in the cost. I wouldn't mind having a case to put the phones in when not using them, but this one is useless, due to the cover being attached. I would much rather have a case with a lid I could lift off so I could have something to sit on the entertainment center shelf to put the phones on when not in use. This case is just impractical.Overall, these are fantastic headphones if you are looking for top-notch sound. Are they worth the equally high price? That's a bit harder to judge, I'm not sure I would have been willing to pay as much as these are listing for. But if you really want great sound and have the money, they should be at the top of the list to consider."],["The flagship Shure SRH1840 open, dynamic headphones are their first entry into the high end audiophile portion of the market. In a crowded field that features many excellent headphones - such as the Sennheiser HD 650s - in this price range, the Shures are a good example of an engineering strategy that emphasizes a more neutral acoustic approach to music. They are reminiscent of the Sennheiser HD 580/600/650 line, which remains popular with audiophiles for their musical accuracy and their relaxed approach to sound. The SRH1840s (the 40 in Shure names refers to their 40 mm neodymium drivers) feature music reproduction that sounds natural and relaxed, with a generous sound stage, good imaging and a pleasing transparency. To my ears they also have an assertive warmth, with music sounding more forward than the most popular Sennheisers, thus avoiding the \"veiled\" sound that some find problematic while listening to headphones from that manufacturer. If you've found the Sennheiser \"veil\" an impediment, you might find that these Shures have a refreshingly different approach to music.While they are effective in reproducing all genres of music, I found the 1840s especially impressive when confronted with complex orchestral recordings. This type of music requires relatively quick response, solid depth of field, a consistent acoustic elegance and a generously wide sound stage, all of which the Shure 1840s possess. Adding vocals by playing Opera only adds to their ability to impress. The 1840s feature a potent mid-range that brings vocals to the fore without burying them beneath orchestral forces. Their musical transparency allows vocals to be enveloped by the orchestra without overwhelming them. In Jazz, and other acoustic instrumental music, the 1840s have a comparable ability to allow each instrument to breathe across a well defined sound stage that is always acoustically liquid and warm. Treble is crystalline and sharp without obvious sibilance or inducing fatigue. Bass is crisp and forceful, although never overemphasized. Only when playing certain kinds of Rock - featuring compression, distortion and artificially emphasized extremes of the musical spectrum - did I find the 1840s to be ill-matched to the material. With this type of popular music they appear to be laboring somewhat to reproduce it effectively. If you listen to a lot of Metal or Hip-Hop, the 1840s are probably not the best headphones for you.The Shure 1840s are light and comfortable: they are a pleasure to wear while listening for several consecutive hours. They come with a hard shell case and include replacement ear pads and a second cable, both of which will undoubtedly come in handy. If you are an experienced head-fier who has never considered Shure headphones, it may surprise you to learn that the 1840s are this good. After several weeks of extensive use, I remain impressed with their ability to reproduce music naturally and warmly. Because they are open back, if you require headphones for use in a crowded and/or noisy environment, you will probably need to look elsewhere. However, if you are not constrained by your surroundings, the Shore SRH1840s are worthy of your consideration. Despite their efficiency and 65 ohm impedance, I recommend you use these with a headphone amp. Although they can be used plugged directly into an iPod, their sound is substantially improved by the added power that an amp provides. To my ears the 1840s sound as good or better than several headphones costing much more. Shure has succeeded in creating a (relatively) moderately priced, audiophile grade headphone for use with almost all genres of music."],["These are some of the nicest sounding headphones I've listened to. Only have a few hours of use, maybe it will get even better."],["These are great headphones and easily fit into my stereo system and my IPOD.I do feel a little silly having headphones on the size of small dinner plates but I have gotten over that since I love how they cancel out all other noises and I can clearly hear the music and the bass.I also tested the headphones out to see if I was able to hear any music from the headphones. If you stand right next to someone with these on you can hear the bass but it's not loud enough to be truly disturbing.Also the sound quality is crystal clear and so far no static feedback that usually happens with most other headphones that I use for more than a month or two.It also comes with a really gorgeous leather case for the headphones.I know that some of the other reviewers talked about burn rates and how to ensure that your headphones have great quality sound but I can honestly say I did not do any of the suggested actions one should apparently take prior to using new headphones. I just assumed that they would sound great when I used them and was glad to see that I was right.I saw the price of this amount and know that if I was on a budget I would probably pass on these headphones for something more affordable but these headphones are truly fantastic.Overall grade: A+"],["My last few pairs of headophones have been AKG 240, and a pair of Beyerdynamic.These Shure phones sound better than any others I've owned, and feel better than any I've owned.I love them, and recommend them highly."],["The Shure SRH 1840 is unique in its truth of tone and clarity. Many top-tier phones spotlight the treble to give the impression of great detail, or emphasize the attack of a musical note at the expense of it's bloom and decay to enhance the impression of greater resolving power. This robs the music of its resonance and sweetness. Not so the 1840: you will hear the body and full resonance of accoustic instruments with a tonal balance that is completely  neutral and convincing. Clarity is of the best kind; musical; distortion free; and smooth. 90% of musical content is in the midrange and the Shure gets it right without sacrificing extended frequency response or dynamic range.These are very comfortable phones; light weight; roomy earcups; low clamping pressure. Build quality is first rate and materials are ideally suited to the phone's function; plastic for the earcups, heavy gauge alluminum for the head-band yokes, and steel for the transducer mounts. No bling.These phones are easy to drive but deserve to be driven by first rate upstream components. They are especially good with Classical and Jazz. They are amongst the very best in reproducing difficult intruments such as piano and violin. In summary, the Shure is elegant in design and operation- a musical delight.N.B. the Shures were driven by Bryston BHA-1 or Woo WA-22 headphone amps with a Luxman D-05 CD player as front end. Comparisons were made to Sennheiser HD-800 and Audeze LCD-2.2 headphones."],["This is a pretty good pair of headphones but I suggest that you get a amp/dac if you are planning to get this headphone because there isn't enough power to produce the sound that it can potentially produce with an amp/dac. These headphones sound amazing with them an amp/dac but without it, these headphones sound average. The downside to these headphones is the price, sometimes I hear some sort of buzz when I listen to music and stuff, these headphones do leak but if you don't turn up your music up like crazy than leakage isn't that bad, and these headphones are quite heavy but as long as you adjust the headband and wear it a lot, you will get use to it. For 400 dollars I expected something a bit better. These headphones feel more sturdier than the beats and bose headphones. It even comes with an extra set of cables and earpad which the bose and beats don't do. It also, comes with a 2 year warranty from the manufacture which is extremely good especially when bose and beats doesn't do that at all. Bottom line these headphones are average and for 400 dollars these aren't really worth the money but way better built that the more well know companies."],["I'm a longtime fan of Shure products, having used countless Shure mics and in-ear monitors in the studio and on stage. This was my first experience with full-sized Shure headphones and I walked away very, very impressed. The sound quality is outstanding. Obviously high-end headphones like these require a high-end audio source to get the most out of them. Overall, I found the sound balanced with a slight brightness. Generally, I prefer a balanced sound and abhor the over-pronounced bass found in headphones like Beats by Dre. The sound response on the 1440's is fantastic and suitable for any type of music you can throw at them.Normally I use in-ear monitors from companies like Ultimate Ears, Shure, and Etymotic. Initially, I was concerned about the comfort level of the 1440s. Considering how big these headphones are, they're almost shockingly comfortable. The headband and ear cups are well padded. I wore these headphones for several sessions that were two hours or longer. I was always satisfied with the comfort.The accessories that come with the 1440s are a nice bonus. The travel case is a cut above most. It came in handy during a few cross country flights and a trans-Pacific flight. The extra ear cups are a nice bonus too.Like I mentioned earlier, these headphones are best when paired with a high-end audio source (quality DACs, receivers, etc.). Using them to listen to MP3s on an iPhone is overkill. Initially, the response favors mids and highs, but after 40 hours of break-in the sound was mostly balanced. It's important to give any type of headphones adequate time to break-in. There are several aftermarket cables that can be used with these headphones. Some claim to offer a different sound experience. I haven't tried any myself, but I appreciate the versatility, flexibility, and durability of attachable cables.All told, this is a quality product that's inline with my expectations of Shure -- great sound, great construction, surprisingly great comfort, and useful accessories."],["I wanted to say the review done by Marty Gillis , is correct.When I got these I was so disappointed at the quality right out of the box given what I read and the reviews.I did as was advised and left it running for a while to &#34;burn-in&#34; the sound.And wow, they sound amazing. Do not be disappointed until you have it running for about 100HOURS then test the sound. The burn-in is legit.Only thing that was bit lacking was the bass at the beginning b/c I listen to bassy songs. But the clarity and the neutral sounds makes up for that and I'm a base guy.Just rememeber to do the review/test after the 100hrs of burn-in to truly get the quality of this headset. I almost returned it. Luckily I didn't. And it's very comfy too.I only didn't give it 5 stars b/c of the bass it's lacking vs other headphone in the price range but otherwise it's VERY GOOD."],["In a nutshell, fantastic headphones sound-wise. Comfort could be improved.If you are considering these headphones, then you most likely have a lot of experience with audio equipment and recognize the importance of driving the headphones with quality upstream equipment.  Also, you recognize how subjective people's opinions of sound can be.  So here's mine...I will be comparing the Shure SRH1840's to a pair ofSennheiser  HD600'sthat I have owned for over a decade. I've grown very used to these cans so figure that into the comparison.The headphones.  The quality of the headphones seems to be very study.  The cable is nice and feels good (some cables can be annoying).  One thing that bother me is that the SRH1840's were not as comfortable as the HD600's. One thing I attribute that to is that there is not left/right rotation capability for the ears.  You can adjust headphones up/down, but the ears do not rotate at all.  I found that strange and disappointing. I noticed the difference every time I switched headphones while listening to different songs.When comparing the Shure SRH1840 and Sennheiser HD600, I listened repeatedly to the songs below.  One of the challenges I found is that if I listened to the whole song and then switched headphones, I would forget the differences.  So I ended up listening back and for to 15 to 20 second parts.  Which was very tedious with the cables.  I also picked songs I knew, so these may not be familiar to you.The sound. One of the things that struck me right away is that the SRH1840's seemed more neutral than the HD600s.  When listening to the piece \"Serenade\", the 1st 10 seconds was a completely different between the two... the HD600's seem to capture the warmth and emotion of the music, the notes seemed to dwell longer.  In general, the quiet classical seemed richer on the HD600s.  This turned right around when I moved into music with vocals.  Sounds like \"Soak it up\" or \"Big Dipper\" seemed to be too close or overdone on the HD600's and just right on the SRH1840's.  The other thing I noticed is that the SRH1840's seemed to be less fatiguing, as in, I could listen to them for a longer period of time without noticing I had headphones on.  I threw in some White Stripes for some smooth and then loud vocals and instruments.  The SRH1840's did not disappoint... the sound was fun and enjoyable.So again, in a nutshell... great sounding headphones, I enjoyed them the most with vocals.  The comfort could be improved.Songs:Yo-Yo Ma - Concerto in G Minor for Two Cellos...Pachelbel(Michael Maxwell) - SerenadeSoak it up - WussyBig Dipper - Cracker  (one of my favorite songs for demoing speakers on)Fell in Love with a Girl - The White StripesWe're Going to be friends - The White Stripes"],["When these headphones arrived, I was a bit worried because the box was so heavy.  Fortunately, the weight came from the packaging. The headphones are so lightweight that I can barely feel them when they are on. The earpads are extremely soft and comfortable. I've never felt headphones like this before!  The detachable cables and spare earpads will help ensure a very long life. The sound is impressive! Every note is clear and strong. They work well for entertainment in the home. Most of the music I listen to is recorded live, and sometimes the clarity suffers. However, almost everything sounds clearer with these headphones. They are also perfect for mixing, when hearing every note is imperative. The open-back design is probably more suited for the studio, but they are also wonderful in the home. The quality can't be beat and they should last many years down the road."],["These headphones are incredible.  The sound is so nuanced, so clean and so layered.  Despite being headphones where the source of the sound is an inch from your ears, the impression it gives is that you are in a room where the sound is a comfortable distance from you.  The feel of depth is incredible.  These are studio professional headphones.  Their virtues is sound quality and comfort and but necessarily small size.  These are large headphones that come in a large case.  It is of open back design meaning that there is a little volume of leak out of the back of each cup.  It serves the purpose so when you are not wearing them, you can still hear just a tiny bit.  It isn't for traveling on a plane.  But for the purpose these are designed, they are fantastic.  The sound quality is excellent.  They are expensive but if you need upper end quality of sound, these are as good as any.  They sound better than my regular floor model loudspeakers.

I've trusted them with my guitars, and they've helped me make the right decisions for my needs and budget. Last year, I bought a set of Fender Custom Shop Texas Specials directly from Alto's web site. Over the past year, I received a bunch of Amazon gift certificates and wanted to get myself a Shure SM7b. When I saw that I could get the mic from Alto Music, it was a no brainer. I was purchasing from my local music store through Amazon. As for the mic, it's an SM7b, and it's everything I was looking for, despite it being a low output mic. It's smooth, has a sexy low end color, has no harshness, brittleness, or high frequency unpleasantness that can occur with some condensers. I'm recording in an untreated basement, and this mic is perfect for when I'm singing loud rock stuff; it only picks up what's right in front of it and none of the room. I'm using a Focusrite 2i2, which is great for loud singing, but I'm picking up a Cloudlifter for some more clean quiet gain to use this mic on acoustic guitars and softer vocals as well.

I prefer it to the Neumann U87.  I recorded two albums with the U87 in professional studios (Ian North \"Neo\" and \"Torch Songs & Arson\") recorded \"World Gone Deaf\" Darkjet at home with the SM7B.  The Neumann is a very accurate mic. The Shure flatters your voice - sounds bigger. Also the SM7B does not pick up noisey a/c or other unwanted sound, making it vastly preferable to condenser mics in a home studio . There is a myth that this is for loud vocals - not true. I whisper sing a lot.  I also prefer this mic to the Electrovoice RE20.  I recorded my commercially released album \"My Girlfriend's Dead\" with the RE20 (prior to buying the Shure). I found the RE20 to be too nasal sounding on my voice and far less transparent than the SM7B. One caveat: the ouput on this mic is quite low - you do need a quality mic preamp."],["I use my Shure SM7B mainly for podcasting and voice work and it performs extremely well in those applications.  I also use aHeil PR-40 Dynamic Studio Recording Microphoneand you can check out that link for my review on that item. Both microphones are dynamic microphones and both give my voice a very warm, natural feel.One thing, well actually two things, the Shure SM7B has that the Heil PR40 does not is a set of two switches.  One for bass rolloff and one for mid-range emphasis / presence boost.  While both of these switches can be useful, I prefer to keep the mic flat and let any outboard processing / EQ handle adjustments that need to be done.  If you don't have outboard processing, both of these could be helpful to you as the bass rolloff really does help keep low frequency noises (for example, someone bumping the table) to a minimum and the presence boost does help certain voice ranges cut through the mix a bit better.When I reviewed the Heil PR-40 I said that it was the best bang for the buck out there and the Shure SM7B may be changing my mind a bit.  While the PR40 is about $70.00 cheaper than the SM7B here on Amazon at the time of this review considerations must be made to the fact that most PR-40 users will want to use a shockmount (about $100) and pop filter / windscreen ($15 - $60) to get the best results out of the microphone.  With the SM7B the shockmount is built into the microphone and does a surprisingly good job and Shure includes two different foam windscreens (one for normal use and one for ultra-close up use) with the microphone.  So the bottom line is the Shure SM7B with all the accessories is probably going to be less than the Heil.Another thing worth mentioning is that like the Heil PR-40 the Shure SM7B is built like a tank.  It is a heavy microphone and in my opinion just looks very cool whether it is mounted on a boom or on a desk stand.  Both microphones perform about the same as far as rejecting any off-axis sounds and both are excellent microphones for voice and podcasting applications.The SM7B takes a little more to drive it than the Heil PR-40, so you'll want to make sure that you have a decent mixer / pre-amp that can handle the microphone.The bottom line is the Shure SM7B is a very high quality microphone and I would highly recommend it.  If you're comparing it to the Heil PR-40 most likely the thing that will make the difference to you will be the aesthetic differences and the price because the performance of these two is very, very close."],["You are looking at what I consider to be the best friend a voice ever had.  During a 40 year broadcast and voiceover career I have used (or been forced to use) every other large diaphragm studio mic on the planet along with the Shure SM7B and it's predecessors the SM7 and SM5.Large diaphragm dynamics have some notable advantages over condenser microphones for voiceover work and solo vocalists in multi-track studio work.  I've used over the years the Sennheiser MD421, EV RE20, EV RE27N/D, Shure SM7B, Shure SM7, Shure SM5 and most recently tried a Heil PR-40.  Sometimes this was not of my own selection, but I just used what was available.  Of the lot the Shure SM7B is my favorite of the ones still available.  The SM7B is a better shielded SM7 and the SM7B of today has a better shock mount than the old SM7 or earlier SM7B.  The shielding in the B model minimizes RFI from computer monitors, florescent lighting, radio transmitter proximity, etc.  The SM7 was a redesign of the SM5.  I consider the SM5 to have been the very best vocal dynamic microphone ever created but it hasn't been in production in ages.  I have used a few ribbon microphones that were also pretty good such as the RCA 77DX and RCA 44 but they were not as good as the SM5 or SM7 or SM7B.Today's SM7B is the best non-condenser vocal microphone still in production.  Stop looking and buy one.  You will not find a better microphone for voice work whether singing or spoken word.  It has a very controllable proximity effect, something that is missing from the EV's.  I can play a SM7B like a violin, the others I just don't seem to have nearly as much proximity effect to toy with for dramatic impact.Everything that is good about condensers for voice work is in an SM7B while everything that is bad about condensers for voice work isn't.DJ's change jobs a lot and I got tired of finding the EV RE20 & RE27N/D mics or the Sennheiser everywhere I went, so I bought my own SM7B.  I never liked the EV's or Sennheiser much and didn't ever feel like they were much of a tool.  The Heil PR-40 is pretty good but doesn't have any on-board EQ options.  For recording not having the EQ is probably no big deal as you can tweak it in post production but for live radio you can't do much of that.The SM7B is a tool for skilled vocal talent, so if you are trying to make a novice sound good you might do better with an RE27N/D but for someone who actually knows how to really work a microphone over then the SM7B is only dynamic large diaphragm mic I know of that can deliver everything a real voice artist has to give.  The reason is that this microphone is designed for one thing, voice work.  The others are more versatile, but the SM7B is \"THE VOICE\" microphone and that was all it was intended to be. It has however found secondary duty as a bass cab microphone and it is pretty good at recording some very loud and boomy sound effects, but it is primarily a vocal microphone.Of all the instruments that have ever been recorded or broadcast, the human voice is the most complex and difficult to capture reliably.  That is one reason vocals sound good on a $4,000 tube condenser microphone, since it can capture all the complexity, inflection and multi-frequency overtones of the human voice.  Unfortunately even these very best condensers also pick up lots of things you didn't intend and also have at least a trace of self generated noise.  If you are doing a dry voiceover you can't hide the hiss of a condenser under something else.  With the SM7B you don't have to.Even for singing this microphone is sort of a secret weapon that kids calling themselves \"Recording Engineers\" today are usually totally ignorant about.  They figure anything short of a multi-thousand dollar tube condenser microphone is inferior for studio vocals and this microphone proves them wrong.If you want a good all around microphone, this is NOT it.  If you want the best dynamic vocal microphone, here it is.  As others have mentioned the output needs a decent preamp but works with all the pro studio gear I've ever connected to it.  I think if you have some cheap USB interface then you will want to put another preamp in front of it and that will make it far more usable for recording whispers.  Most real studio preamps are a good match for it. I've plugged it into some real junky mixers and had it work too.  You need at least 60 dB of gain, the spec sheet actually says 59.  70 dB would be better. Lots is made of the \"LOW OUTPUT\" of -59 dB but it isn't all that much less than the Shure SM58 which is -54.5 dB! -4.5 dB isn't much at all for any decent mic preamp.  But again most of the \"one-box-solution\" USB interfaces with built-in mic preamps is probably going to need some help as they were designed with the hotter output of a condenser in mind.The Shure SM7B comes with the built in shock mount in the stand mounting and yoke attachments.  Every other large diaphragm dynamic has a shock mount made for it but it costs extra.  They all need an external windscreen but only the SM7B comes with one! I got mine 10 years ago when it still came with two windscreens.  It has a nice metal case for storage/travel.  I think now they just come with one windscreen which is the bigger one Shure calls the A7WS but still come in the metal case.  I use the smaller windscreen mostly and Shure calls them the RK345 and their distributors still carry them. The smaller windscreen makes the microphone more open and airy for me and I'd suggest getting one of the RK345's, but that is the only accessory you'll need to add.  The windscreens are held on by some little Velcro tabs but easily interchanged.  They are also very durable for foam screens.On the back end of the tube is a round plate you remove with a hex key and under the plate are multiple EQ adjustments for Flat/Bass Rolloff/Presence Boost settings that you can fiddle with to get the sound you like best. You can just leave the plate off if you want. This is easily the most EQ flexibility of any large diaphragm dynamic.So I'm just adding my two cents worth here and joining the others who pretty much all agree this thing rules for voice work.  I should have written this review earlier but wanted to try the new Heil PR-40 first to make sure I was still an SM7B guy and it took a while for the Heil tryout to happen since I didn't want to actually buy one.  I still am an SM7B guy.  I would give it 4.5 stars but it won't let me do that, since there is nothing better right now in the class I rounded it up to 5 stars, but the SM5 was actually a bit closer to a 5 star vocal mic."],["I purchased this microphone as a gift. They were so excited to receive it. They use it for work and love it so much that they are going to purchase a second one. Great product!"],["I bought this mic based solely on reviews I read.

Exceptional value for this price."],["If you are looking for a microphone for voice-overs or broadcast use, THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO BUY.The Shure SM-5 and SM-7 microphones are the best voice mics ever made.  The large SM-5 is no longer made, so you can only find it used, but the SM-7 is just as good.  Either one, you have the best.Don't let the price fool you.  I have brought this in to studios that have $3000 Neuman condenser mics and they laughed when I said I wanted to use my $300 Shure mic instead.  I told them to put up both mics and do an A/B test while I spoke into each of them.  The three other audio engineers in the studio had to agree, the Shure was better and it was a night and day difference, not hard at all to decide it was best.This mic has a warmth and rich sound no other mic can give you.Even industry publications like MIX MAGAZINE and RadioWorld have done reviews where they did the same tests and said the same things about this mic in comparison to the expensive condenser mics...--------------------------------------------from MIX MAGAZINE, March 1998, page 53:Eric Paul has made a career out of recording country giants like Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Johnny Cash and many others:  \"My favorite overall microphone for voices is the Shure SM-5.  If they can't get a Shure SM-5, they can still get Shure SM-7s, which are still available.  If you've tried out three very expensive tube mics and you aren't happy with any of them, then the next step should immediately be a Shure SM-7.  I will almost always guarentee you that if the expensive mic doesn't work, an SM-7 will.  For some reason, people sound better on them.\"----------------------------------------------from RADIO WORLD, February 18 1998, page 62:Joe Stack, director of engineering for ABC radio said: \"When I worked at WATH in Athens, Ohio, I had someone call and offer me ten RE-20s for the three SM-5s we had.  I turned him down.\"------------------------------------------from EQ MAGAZINE, July 2006 issue:The SM7 is perhaps most famous for being used as the vocal microphone on Michael Jackson's Thriller engineered by Bruce Swedien.-----------------------------------------------Some interesting facts about the SM-7...\"When we were doing \"Off The Wall\", \"Thriller\" and \"Bad\" I ended up with 6 Shure SM7's. That is a fantastic mike.\"  - Bruce SwedienThe Red Hot Chili Peppers have used the SM 7 on vocals on every album they have done.You can see James Hetfield from Metallica singing into a Shure SM 7 on the \"Some Kind Of Monster\" DVD.----------------------------------------Another thing I have noticed in the studio, is that some of my other mics require gating and downward expanders on the mics to get rid of room noise, but the SM-7 doesn't need it.  It is quiet all by itself.And to save many hours trying to edit out mouth noises, clicks and smacks from voice-over talent that use expensive CONDENSER microphones, just have them use the SM-7 next time, and no more wasted time editing out mouth noises anymore.Throughout the years on the Howard Stern Show, they have replaced and tried all sorts of microphones, from the Electrovoice RE-20 to Neuman mics.  But if you notice, the Co-host, Robin Quivers, STILL uses the Shure SM-7 and refuses to change to any of the other mics.  You can see throughout the years on the TV show that although the mics are always changing for everyone else, Robin ALWAYS has the SM-7 to this day.Since the Howard Stern Show has moved to Sirrius Sattelite, the show had to buy new microphones, (couldn't take them with from CBS) and everyone seems to be using the same mics they did before.  Robin has another SM-7 so she really likes this mic!  It looks different now, because she has the larger windscreen that now comes with the SM-7."],["Got one from guitar center great mic does wonderful things if u know how to mix it this mic sounds clean and powerful its the best dynamic microphone ever if you know sound dynamics mics are punchy powerful then mic is clean and poweful but its not a neumann stop saying or comparing the neumann u87 is the king of clear condensed polished sound you have to pre eq this mic definetly for vocals in music but not much tho with that being said this is one of the only mics that sound good on everybody voice if u know what u doing this gives power and cuts through a mix big good for voice over no eq needed for voice over really so listen to me anybody serious about sound need s this every studio needs this for dynamics and power you can't give under five stars your a pup."],["The tone of this is about as good as it gets for any mic under 1 grand.

The characteristics of this dynamic mic allow us to get great, warm sound without extra noise.Be sure to pair this mic with a good, clean pre-amp, as you'll need to pump up the gain.  I use a Grace M101 and strongly suggest it."],["This is the best sounding mic I have used in my 30 years of working with sound. I have a couple high-end large-diaphragm condenser mics and worried that this one wouldn't be able to produce the sound levels I needed. Was I ever wrong! The microphone is golden on vocals (only use it for close-mic voiceover work), but the quietest I have ever heard when it comes to background noise. Even having the A/C kick on during a session does nothing. I had heard the mic was good in this regard, and bought it after a recent move left me without a professional recording environment. Outstanding performance!For those not in the know, you do need a preamp with more juice than most (Shure recommends +60db gain at a minimum), or you need to buy a Cloudlifter to make sure you have enough gain for line-level input. I am currently using this with the Mackie 402-VLZ3 which is a quality product but definitely on the low end. Sounds very nice with it alone, but once I added the Cloudlifter, the mic came alive. Sounds very warm and intimate at default settings, can roll the bass off if working with a script containing more plosives, and can boost the mid-range presence if desired. I have always handled this on the mixer or in post, and have considered these settings on the mic itself to be a little hokey in the past. However, I must say quite frankly that I was impressed with these two settings on the mic.Overall, in my top 3 pieces of electronic equipment, and wouldn't hesitate for an instant to recommend it to others. When you buy your $3000 Neumann and don't like the way you sound, try this - you will likely be impressed. If I would have spent a grand or two on it, I would write the same review - when you get this much performance for $350, what can you say? You definitely get much more than you pay for.Regarding build quality: It is very well built. Materials feel expensive, it is large and solid.

This is a friendly mic that sounds great.You should know:* You'll need a pre-amp with 60dB gain to get a proper level out of this mic. Most computer audio interfaces with built-in mic pre's have only 30-40db of gain. As a test, if an SM58 in your setup requires that you max the gain,  you'll definitely need to pair this mic with an external pre-amp (you probably need one for your SM58 too!).* This isn't intended as a hand-held live mic, though people have done it."],["The mic sounds great but plan on spending more money on a cloud lifter to boost the signal.

After careful consideration, I elected to pick up the SM7b.I have not been disappointed!The SM7b's rejection of ambient noise is superb; it takes EQ and compression very well; and the overall tone of the mic is quite pleasant. It's not a &#34;neutral&#34; mic--it does have a pronounced thickening effect on spoken word, but with the low-cut and mid-boost switches on the rear of the mic, you can tailor your sound to be as clear as you need. (I also notice that by removing the foam wind-screens and using a regular pop-filter, the top end opens up quite nicely.)The two provided wind-screens are great for general-purpose and close-talk applications; in particular, the second, fatter windscreen completely kills plosives. I can get right up on it and never pop a single 'P'.I needed this mic because I needed a tool that would provide a top-quality sound, would work easily every time, and get the job done quickly and well. The SM7b fulfills all those criteria.I feel like I would be remiss, however, if I did not mention the mic's one shortcoming: it is EXTREMELY low output. You're going to need a very high-gain preamp or a Cloudlifter (or FetHead) to really get this mic to come alive. Once you do, though--it sings. Would recommend as anybody's first &#34;serious&#34; mic."],["Like some others I went the route of buying and then outgrowing all kinds of USB mics, having spent a total of about $550. Finally I decided that I really needed an XLR mic in order to use multiple mics at once. After doing a lot of research I finally decided upon the Shure SM7B and I'm really happy I did. In this price range in terms of dynamic mics, which I need because I record from home without the benefit of a quiet studio. My choice came down to the SM7B or a Heil PR-40, which is also a great sounding dynamic mic. The fact that the SM7B has a built in suspension system and therefore does not need a shock mount, plus it does not need a pop-filter helped make the decision. These two items for the Heil add more than $150 to the cost. Besides, the SM7B is an industry workhorse and has been used now for over 30 years.After using it for the past month, all I can say is that it is a great sounding mic, needing little to no processing. Also, as most others state, this mic needs a lot of clean gain. I bought a small  Mackie 402-VLZ3 Premium 4-Channel Ultra-Compact Mixer from Amazon for $99. Mackie has a great rep for having very nice clean pres and the Mackie will power this with the gain turned to 3:00 (rotary dial), which leaves some headroom, plus the gain is very clean. So a $100 mixer will work well with this mic., as long as it's a Mackie. Before I received the mic., I decided to play it safe and ordered an inline preamp called the Fethead for an additional $100. The Triton Fethead is powered by the phantom power on my Mackie and adds another +25 db. This allows me to run the SM7B with the rotary gain knob set at 10:00 if I wish.As a different reviewer already wrote; don't waste your time and money moving up every few months from your latest USB mic., cut right to the chase and buy the SM7B for $349. If I had followed this advice I could have bought the SM7B and the Fethead and still had $100 in my pocket, compared to what I wasted finally learning this truth."],["GREAT! NO PROBLEMS. But did anyone else get the wall of foam and yoke mount, that was said supposedly included?"],["So I am a big fan of the SM57 Microphone as a vocal mic due to its ease of recording and good sound quality.I have a bunch of the Large Style Condenser Microphones (Rode NT1-A, AT2020, SP C-1) and they are clear, but so sensitive that it's difficult to get a solid performance and mix without them either clipping or picking up everything in the room. So if you're like me andlike to let go a bit when you sing, you should try a Dynamic Mic for the wide range and forgiveness they can giveyou when you belt a little.I did an A / B test against the SM7B I just bought and the SM57 (I love) for vocals - with the exact same processing chain, cable, settings, etc. and just switched the mics out. I sung the same passage as well, and I have to say - the SM57 sounds muddy in comparison to the SM7B. If I didn't have this new microphone I would still like the SM57, but the Genni is out of the bottle now... so not going back. The SM7B is clear and sounds sweet in comparison and still handles the vocal sound dynamics very well.DYNAMIC SINGERS ( Rock, Jazz, GOSPEL, OPERA )= If you have the budget get this SM7B and if you don't, buy the SM57 until you do have the budget.QUIET SINGERS (ACOUSTIC , FOLK ) = If you sing softly all of the time you really don't need one of these dynamic mics, and would be better off with the standard Large Condenser mics as listed above. Of those type, I like the Studio Projects C-1 Best I think, but they are close."],["Beautiful, does absolute wonders. If you're questioning if it is worth the money, it's worth every god damn penny! You're welcome."],["I have used this mic for recording vocals and electric guitars and am very happy with it. It would be better if it came with a storage case, however."],["I can't do more than underscore the endorsement of this mic by the previous reviewer (FOX).  If you haven't started in the mic-collecting business, trying every trendy dynamic and condenser mic in the hundred dollar range and below, you might actually save some bucks by cutting directly to the chase and going for this one.  I've always wondered why I can't reproduce the sounds of our local NPR outlet, and I finally realize it's because they have the Shure SM7B and I don't.It enhances the voice with depth and richness and filters out the pops and unwanted percussives (face it, those separate pop filters are cumbersome to use).  It's very directional and \"selective\" (rejecting room ambience and background noise), so it's perhaps not the ideal mic for all applications.  But for announcing, broadcasting, vocal performance and vocal recording, I don't see how anything could possibly equal let alone surpass it."],["I recorded vocals for our last album with my Beta 58, and used this for our new album.  The difference is incredible.  This thing picks out all the nuances.  The Beta 58 will still be my live choice, but this thing is perfect for recording my mix of clean and metal screaming vocals.  We were considering a condenser mic, but i think we made the right choice considering the dynamics of vocal types that I use.  We did not need a special preamp for this, we simply used the usb interface we already had."],["The Shure SM7B was my go-to mic for voiceover / podcast for a couple years before I switched to condensers. Males with a low voice in the 150-300Hz range sound fantastic with this mic, as well as any female voice that may have sibilance issues. Paired with a proper pre-amp, the SM7B is a tough mic to beat and is probably the best there is for under $1000. It does shootouts with some of the best mics in the industry for a reason.Anyone who has noise issues with the mic probably needs to invest in a higher-end preamp: 20-40dB of gain just won't do it unless you're screaming. I was regularly giving this 55-60dB of gain, which really brought on the noise with cheaper preamps, and even then I'd need to close-talk it (about 3-5&#34;).Ultimately, I have to recommend it if you want something quality under $1000 and have preamp with gain to spare.

I have never used it on instruments so I can't speak to that area of use.  There is plenty of information out there about the SM7B, just be sure to read the reviews specifically for what you want to use it for.  One thing I strongly recommend is a really good preamp.  This mic needs a ton of gain to reach it's full potential.  I have tried a few different ones but eventually settled on the ART Pro Channel.  I also occasionally use a Cludlifter CL1."],["I don't have much to add. just wanted to say this peace is amazing. I record singing with it, and it makes my voice sound worm and beautiful.

Classic mic and extremely versatile. Especially in VoiceOver and live recording."],["I am a Dj and the SM7B is a pretty good mic it is clear and has an occasional pop. I think that for on air use it is a good affordable buy. I would recommend it very highly."],["What you need to know about this mic:1) This mic is very directional. You must keep your mouth in the sweet spot at all times for best results. Pulling back an inch gets into tinny muddy territory, and an inch too close makes for a strong proximity effect. I found that a palm's width from the tip of the mic works best. As long as I keep my mouth there, the results are predictable and good regardless of the room I'm in. Also if the mic is aimed too low on your face (like at the lower lip or chin) you'll sound like you have a stuffy nose. Aimed too high (like at the bridge of the nose) sounds sneering and nasal. Right at the upper lip works well for me.2) The bass cut and presence boost are convenient. Use a plastic thing like a guitar pick to switch them, as metal will scratch it. I've played around with the switches and in the end both set to flat was best. Initially I thought the presence boost was a good idea, but in a mix it made my vocals too honky in the upper mids. Flat's where it's at. Flat sounds most natural.3) Being a dynamic, it won't sound as open and airy as a condenser might. Though it takes EQ well, and you can EQ that in. If you remove the foam and use a pop filter, you do get more highs, but after working with that for a while I realized it doesn't always sound right, seems to unbalance the highs above 5k toward sibilance a little too much, but it might work for you. After using it for a few years, I learned that starting with a bad mix that is too bright or blaring and then adding in the SM7B on vocals causes the mic to appear dull and muffled, but really it's the mix that's the problem. Whereas if I start with the vocal sound and make it clear and natural, and build the mix around it, the mix turns out to have a natural sound that's not too bright or dull either.4) Yes, it rejects room sounds more than a condenser, but not gobsmacked amazingly so. It rejects what's behind and to the side, but in front it's pretty sensitive. So if you're singing with an echoey room behind you, it will pick that up. So don't think this will make you sound like you're in a dead control room, unless you actually are in one. Hang some blankets or acoustic foam behind you and you're set. Being that it records about twice as dry as a condenser, it takes reverb pretty well in a mix, meaning you can add reverb and delay without having your vocals drop too far away and undefined in the mix.5) So what does it sound like? The sound is *very* natural and true to my voice. It truly is a vocal mic first and foremost. That plus the dry/up-close characteristic are this mic's top selling points. It works fantastically on death metal growls and clean singing atop sparse/acoustic/clean backgrounds. It does have slight color in the mids; I agree with the frequency response chart indicating it has a slight scoop 400-900Hz, slight boost 1000-2000Hz, but it's still natural sounding despite that. The color is tailored to the voice: reduce the honky boxy mids, accentuate the main vocal intelligibility range. That's one reason why this mic is considered \"flattering\" on vocals. It still has body though, definitely not a thin sounding mic.6) This thing is heavy and rugged. The capsule is surrounded by this truncated cone-like metal screen enclosed on all sides. The screen is like the kind you see behind microwave oven doors. What I like about this mic is that I can throw it inside a bubble mailer or wrap it in a scarf for storage and not have to worry about crushing or damaging it, and it doesn't need a big case like some condensers and especially tube mics do. So it's actually compact in practice and quick to set up with one of those detachable mic adapter mounts. Even without the adapter, it has a convenient free rotating collar to screw it onto a mount/stand so that you can hold the mic in place while screwing it down.7) This mic needs 50 dB gain for loud singing, 55-60dB for quiet singing, 65-70dB for whispering. Make sure your preamp is designed for at least 60dB of clean gain. Some cheaper USB interfaces only go up to 35dB. If your interface lacks the juice, no worries, get yourself a CloudLifter and it'll add 25dB of nice clean gain and it's phantom powered too.Overall, I would prefer a condenser in a good room since it allows me to move a little more without coloring the sound, and because it has a more openness and air compared to this one. But since my room isn't perfect, this will do. The biggest pros are that it's natural sounding and that even with reverb and delay it stands out in a mix. It's especially good on spoken voice, as it was designed for, since unlike a condenser the SM7B does a very good job of not picking up as many mouth clicks, mouth noises, and background hissing.In the end, if I had to get rid of all my mics and keep only one for vocals for the rest of my life, it would be the SM7B. Mainly because I know I can conveniently use it anywhere, anytime, and get reliable good results.EDIT 2014:  Forgot to say, when you listen to mic shoot-outs on the net, often times the tip of the SM7B will be positioned the same distance as the condenser. This is a problem because the SM7B's diaphragm is actually back a few inches. So the condensers will be closer to the talent (or lack of talent) than the SM7B in such cases, causing the latter to sound more duck-ish, honky, un-detailed, or thin due solely to distance factors, and is thus not characteristic of the intrinsic mic color. In shoot-outs where the proper distance was used, you'd be surprised how much the SM7B sounds like a good condenser. It really does. Of course it may be missing air (or conversely, be less prone to sibilance) but as I said below you can *easily* EQ that in, since this mic takes EQ very well. Seriously, a 2dB shelf in the highs. Another thing I wanted to add, is that the gentle bump in the 1k to 2k region (for vocal definition) that his mic has, can sound slightly honky or strident or blaring depending on some sources, but again you can EQ that down a bit. And finally, when Shure says this mic has a flat response, that's not true, it has color and the frequency response charts show it. Yet, the color gives it a larger than life natural sound on voice, so it sounds natural even though it's not completely transparent and honest."],["I've used the Shure SM7B at a couple of stations in my radio career over the years and decided I would splurge to make it my home microphone for everything from voice overs to Skype.  So I picked this up from Amazon reseller BSW, along with a USB pre-amp and boom (I got the mic cord from Amazon).Two days later, everything arrived.  The result is simply awesome.The mic doesn't pick up background noise, such as my forced-air heating or my PC fan.

I blindly purchased and although I can see why broadcasters would use it, I wonder how many pop/alt vocalists actually do.  It's a dynamic mic, so I compared it to my workhorse live/studio mic the Shure 58A.  There's no comparison, the 58A is powerful.  The SM7B sounds faint and actually took away from my voice rather than enhancing.  Then I compared it to my Gauge ECM-87 (a replica of the Neumann U-87)...still nothing.  I have a thinner voice, so that might be it, but I urge anyone interested in purchasing it to try it....preferably on a mix of their own music.Above is the original review.  To be fair, I have to add:  I was in a situation where I could not use a condenser mic due to a weird low rumble around where I live.  So, I said, OK SM7B...one more chance.  The song was very \"pop\" with lots of drums and heavy base line and I had to really belt out the vocals.  The SM7B allowed me to put the song down in a single take that day.

This is considered the gold standard by which all others are measured. Of course at least part of this reputation is deserved, but perhaps more for the durability of the SM58 than its sound. I have a couple of SM58s and a couple of PG58s. I was considering the SM48, but the PG58 has slightly better specs, and almost identical price.The first thing I noticed out of the box was that the PG58 is slightly bigger and slightly heavier. It also has a different switch than the SM58. The metal screens protecting them aren't interchangeable. I then plugged in one microphone cable so the settings would be identical. I tried both mikes, one after the other, first with speaking and then with singing and playing guitar, and then I changed the settings, or more specifically, the effects and the EQ on the PA. I repeated the experiment, speaking and then singing while changing between mikes.Here's what I noticed: The SM58 is slightly flatter in the mid range. The PG58 is slightly brighter and has a touch more presence. They are about equal on volume. The slight differences in tone can be easily manipulated with an EQ or just ordinary tone controls. Neither was susceptible to much feedback or vocal pop.I haven't tried out this side by side comparison in a live situation or even in practice, as it's too time consuming and interferes with playing. It's difficulty to judge in those situations too, or at least awkward, but I have used a combination of the two in practice and no one seems to be able to tell the difference, except one person actually expressed a preference for the PG58, but that could be just the settings.I looked at the specs for the two mikes side by side. The SM58 is a little flatter in response, especially at the high end, over 10K Hz, and it picks up a few dB before the PG 58, somewhere between 50 and 60 Hz. However, since the human vocal range is generally between around 300 and 3000 Hz, neither of these seems likely to have much effect, although the SM58 might be a tad more responsive for a bass singer.I also tried out two different Behringer mikes and a Radio Shack mike. The Behringer 8500 was totally outclassed by both of the Shures, sounding tinny and thin and with little presence or volume. I tried out a Behringer 2000XM and was impressed by the similarity. These mikes sound almost identical (The B 2000 and the Shure SM). The Behringer 2000XM seems to have been discontinued, though, and replaced with the 1800XM, an inferior mike offered in bundles of three for under $50.I then plugged in a Radio Shack mike that was a spare backup, not even taken out for practice. The model number is 33-3001, probably also discontinued. This was an excellent sounding mike, with good volume, presence and tone.I didn't have any other mikes to test in this side by side experiment, but I did reach some conclusions:There is quite a bit of snobbery in choosing microphones, with the Shure SM58 held up as some unreachable standard. They ARE sturdy, and they are good mikes and the price is not unreasonable, at around $100. However, there are other microphones which sound nearly identical and are also sturdy and reliable, at lower prices, including the Shure PG58, and most likely the SM48, though I didn't have any of those to test.I wish more people would give unbiased reviews based on actual performance instead of condescension toward those who are either on a budget or looking for alternatives to the standard bearer. I'm giving this 4 stars only because I haven't had enough time to give an evaluation of how this holds up in comparison to the SM58."],["Purchased 2 of these for a gig and they performed as good as our SM58's, no problem."],["So I run a small recording studio in my home and work with the audio systems at our church and other events. All the places I've ever worked at trust SHURE microphones. I bought the PG58, and its apparent why that is. Giving little or no feedback at high volumes, the PG58 really owns up to its SHURE name. It has a shockmount inside so the handling noise is barely there. The rugged handle and materials used to build it can take a serious beating. I myself treat my equipment very well, but I know others who use SHURE microphones and DON'T take the best care....and they're nearly indestructible!

I'd probably be all too ready to agree with those who argue that a Neumann or Telefunken mic costing 5 G's simply isn't that much better than a Nady mic costing 10 bucks.  But with respect to the Shure, I'm less sure that the SM58 isn't worth 40% more than the PG58.  Perhaps if you have a sufficiently high-powered and \"clean\" amplifier and have tweaked the EQ settings to favor the frequencies of the human voice, the two mics could be mistaken for one another.  It was my attempts to occasionally use an instrument amplifier as an emergency P.A. that led me to realize the PG58 sounded somewhat muted and dull compared to the SM58.  Switching to the more common, admittedly more expensive mic, gave me just the extra gain I needed along with added crispness and clarity to the voice (at least for announcements).P.S. I notice that the head of the PG58 is larger than that of the SM58.  Since the rise of the \"digital audio workstation\" (who doesn't have a computer with free, included Garage Band on it?), large, even gold-plated, expensive-looking but cheap mics are on display all over the place.

There was a time when Shure was the great American cartridge company and virtually everyone with a component turntable owned at least one Shure product.  I paid only US$ 18.95 plus shipping for this little red and black beast. Mine said it was Made in Mexico on the box. Packaging is modest and not as luxurious as what Shure provides for its more expensive M97eX. I also own a Shure M97eX (also from Amazon)and a Shure stylus force gauge (a must have for all owners of non P-Mount tables).The Shure M92E is for P-Mount tonearms i.e. for plug in style cartridges that are held in place with a single screw. This makes alignment easy with no need to adjust the tonearm. There is also an adapter to use the cartridge on standard tonearms as well. I used my M92E on a Technics BD20d turntable.  This is a low cost Technics table that I bought new about ten years ago and the basic design dates back to the mid 1980s.  I have the modest Technics cartridge that it came with and a better Ortofon OM3P cartridge which cost around $50.The Shure is surprisingly good sounding. It has a nice, warm balance without shrill highs and bass is actually quite good. It is much better than the rather edgy sounding Technics cartridge that came with the turntable. The Shure is not quite as smooth, detailed or three dimensional as the Ortofon but is flatter, more even and open sounding.I am guessing a lot of people looking at this Shure cartridge are going to use it on a turntable similar to mine so I suggest adding a low cost thin felt platter mat from Pro-ject on top on the rubber one that comes with the turntable. I find it damps out unwanted vibration better and allows this cartridge to do its thing. You do not need it, but on my set up, it really let this little Shure sing.  I played all kinds of music on it and while it seemed happiest with rock and jazz, even classical was very pleasant sounding.  What you get is natural sound with no nasties. What you do not get is a very detailed, articulate sound or a lot of air around the instruments or great imaging.  The Shure's faults are errors of omission rather than any significant vices. Frankly I have owned some cartridges in the $300-400 that were not as even and pleasant overall as this little Shure.I strongly recommend the Shure M92E for LP lovers on a budget."],["I am using this with an old turntable.  the stereo is connected to the computer so I can transfer records (LP's) to my hard drive and later to CD's.  the cartridge has a good midrange and bass.

I replaced the stock Audio Technica cartridge on the Technics with the Shure M92-E. I also bought Discwasher D4 cleaning fluid. My previous set up included the turntable hooked up to a Sherwood integrated amp driving a pair of Infinity RS4000 three way speakers. So, everything about my set up has changed! Nevertheless, my current set up with the new cartridge sounds really nice.

I feel that my records are safe with this cartas opposed to some that I simply have no idea of the design and history. A bad stylus or acrappy cart can ruin a record. Since sonic impressionsare what you will be most curious about, I'll describe them.I am listening to the M92E right now playing Captain Beefheart's \"Clear Spot\". I must admit that for the money I paid (half the current price but no mounting kit) I get lots of pleasure knowing my best carts are ready to use but the M92E is oddly pleasing. It does nothing particularly wrong OR right except do its job and fade into the background. Compared to a cartridge at least twice-the-price, the soundstage is a bit thin, the general clarity of location of sounds in the mix is better on pricier carts.It is very easy to listen to. If you are playing a record while doing other things, not listening with care, it does an excellent job. If you crave a decent second cart for emergencies or for \"everyday\" use, saving that high-dollar cart for times when you want the difference, this is a fine choice. Not into Vinyl THAT much but want decent sound ? Good choice. There is a big difference between this cart and the Shure M97XeShure M97xE High-Performance Magnetic Phono CartridgeThe M97 keeps the Shure sound while improving on every sonic area almost even-handedly...very Shure. The mass of the different stylus assemblies combined with a finer elliptical tip give it much of the \"space\" and transients that the M92E naturally muffles.The M92E is so neutral sometimes you feel it has kicked-in to reverse...the 18,000 hz roll-off gives ita very muted upper-end when compared with an Audio-Technica, in many ways the polar opposite of the Shure designs.That said, any Shure engineer would likely say,\" If the customer wants exaggerated treble they can use the controlson the amp or receiver\". They have a valid point. The cartridge can \"disappear\" on you, you find yourself listening to the music and not the system. If the stylus is broken-in and the record and stylus are clean, the stylus mounted correctly the M92E is all the cartridge MOST people need, then again, many people returning to vinyl are looking for ultimate sound. It is not in this cartridge.You DO get what you pay for...Shure has always been a great value, from the SM-57 and SM-58 microphones which, though 50 year-old designs, are still the industry standard vocal and instrument microphones at reasonable price!****OTHER POINTS ****This cartridge is great at tracking \"difficult\" discs. The finest cartridges require an excellent, flat surface to providethe BEST in sound yet we all end up with a few records that warp from one thing or another. Also, as LP manufacturing and recordings became more able to put the energy of an artists musical vision on vinyl the demand on the tiny needle, or stylus, to track these tracings correctly increased. Shure was on the \"cutting-edge\" of making good-sounding, affordable and ultra-reliable moving-magnet cartridges that track much better than most carts in the same price range.  That legacy lives on in the basic design.The products are still made in America, just Latin-America. If Shure treats its Mexican workers well and transplants the manufacturing skills they will have few if any quality-control issues.. There are problems every time production is moved in this way. I have seen a slip in quality of a number of Shure products in this transition but most things look very good. If you buy a Shure Stylus, eyeball it and if it is not straight, send it back. Most all are fine but it was an issue and may still be. I have a good microscope and both of my new Shures were fine.The body of the M92 accepts a large number of old Shure styli, many of higher quality than what you get with the cartridge. It does not always work but can. There is plenty of info on upgrading these. Put a really good stylus on it and it changes the whole ballgame...handy! You can even get a newly-made, higher quality stylus from Shure so you have an upgrade path.If you are on a real budget or want a second cart for whatever use (no scrachin' this cart, though) it is an excellent choice. If you want really fine sounding vinyl playback, buy a better cartridge and either way, buy or make a record washer. The yellow, manual spin-clean works very well. I CANNOT believe I did not know of these in the 1970's. Every record, new or old must be washed now and then if you want to hear music and no pops, clicks and such.Spin-Clean Record Washer MKII Complete System"],["Ah just like it was 1981 again.

The sound quality is very hard to beat for the price. The detail is there and the frequency response is great. Tracking force is standard as any p-mount is.

If you want an audiophile-esque setup at the end of your tone arm for a great price you can also use the N97XE replacement stylus and that really makes this thing sing. Just an FYI this cartidge is a bit bright and suffers from some sibbilance right out of the box but literally after about 3-4 hours of listening on it and the bottom end tightened up and the high end splash had dissipated.

At first I bought it thinking I would upgrade later to an SM58 when I got some more cash, but honestly I am incredibly pleased with the performance of this microphone and won't be replacing it anytime soon.I read somewhere that this mic is actually better suited to recording purposes because it doesn't have a transformer built in like the SM58. Whether or not it makes a difference, I can say that it seems easier to fit in the mix than an SM58 to me. I borrowed a friends 58 to compare and I came up with an interesting conclusion. The SM48 seems to fit better in the mix with less effort. I just high pass around 180 hz and slightly boost top end around 4k to give it a little more air. It comes out smooth as butter.. With the SM58 I found myself wanting to cut a lot of mid range out because it was almost overbearing. To me, all of this makes perfect sense when discussing qualifications for a live vocal mic used by a lead singer. You would normally want that extra mid range presence in a live setting, but for recording the SM48 wins in my book.Other than sound, the main selling point is value. I expected mediocre results with this mic, especially since I picked it up for $30 but it has absolutely blown me away. I am going to buying at least 2 more in case I come across an artist with several vocalists. The build quality is also great.

There's a full 10,000 Hz more of high frequency captured by the 58. Even though the high end of that spectrum falls outside of the human vocal range, it allows for a brighter, crisper sound. This mic doesn't make vocals seem as \"alive\" as its more expensive sibling. With that said, it's not a bad mic, either. It's fine for backing vocals, especially females, who are more apt to cut through the murkier color of the mic. I've also had good results with using it as an overhead drum mic, as it seems to reject some of the harsher overtones of cymbals. If you're on a budget, or only need a mic for speaking or making video, it's probably a great choice. For live music, though, the SM48 can't match the sound of its legendary big brother. The housing and screen are as solid as the rest of Shures mics, and shouldn't give you any trouble, unless you abuse them mercilessly. If you're a lead vocalist, hold out for the SM58. It's well worth the extra 50 dollars, especially since you'll be using it for years and years to come."]],"title":"Shure SM48-LC Vocal Dynamic Microphone, Cardioid","total_reviews":60,"sentiment":0.7195783333,"label":"positive","best_review":["I'm very happy whit the quality sure mic honesty recommends to my friends and the cost is expensive is clear and nice mic"]},{"asin":"B0002BACBO","brand":"Shure","imUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41enr7ezWHL._SY300_.jpg","rating":[0,0,0,3,21],"reviews":[["This is a amazing microphone and is one of the best ones i have used."],["I haven't recorded any instruments with this, but this mic picks up vocals very well and gives a clear sound.

Issues with muddiness, save for a vocalist's natural sound, vanish instantly.I play in what can best be described as an insulated shed. I sing in very close proximity to my fellow band members' amplifiers. At the beginning of the night, while the mix was still at what it should always be at, this microphone was like a small slice of musical bliss. Unfortunately, by the end of the night, the instruments were turned up to deafening levels and I had to switch back to the, also recommended,Shure Beta 57A Microphone. Not because of feedback issues, amazingly; but because the condenser was picking up too much ambient sound.

It has some heft to it, it looks nice, it feels nice to the touch; but best of all? It sounds amazing.The pickup pattern is Supercardioid which has a little more rear-pickup than you'd think; but sound quality alone trumps this small annoyance. The think that separates the 87A from the rest of the Shure handheld pack is that it is a condenser microphone - so don't use it on terribly loud sound sources.

The sound of a good condenser on vocals is a must for pro sounding recordings. Shure has managed to bring that sound to the stage for use in live performance. I have a decent Mackie based PA system (Mackie mixer and Mackie active speakers) and I must say that every positive reveiw is true. This is the best live vocal microphone I have ever used. For the past 25 years I have been faithful to Shure SM58 mics for vocals but now I am hooked on the Beta 87A. Yes they are expensive but if you can afford it they are worth it. Borrow one if you can and you'll see what I mean. If you have a high quality PA system you should have a high quality microphone and this is it.Warning: The Shure Beta 87A (87 and 87C) along with the Shure Beta 58 are heavily counterfeited and sold on sites like Ebay and Craig's list. They look almost perect and come in perfectly duplicated Shure boxes with warrenty cards, mic pouches and mic collars. The first thing to check for if you get one is to see if it is actually a condenser mic. Most of the counterfeits out there are poor sounding dynamic mic capsules.

In 2010, after checking customer reviews on several guitars in the entry-level range, I narrowed my choice to a couple of Epiphones, a Mitchell and a Yamaha.  I played them all and chose the Yamaha F335 for its good build quality and nice sound.  I find the sound to be mellow and pleasing, not too boomy in the lows nor too shrill in the highs, and with good resonance.  The action was acceptable right out of the box, but I did lower it a bit (by trimming the underside of the saddle) when I changed strings and now it's just right for me.  The build quality is very good, and was better than the other models I played that day.  (I have since seen an Epiphone at a different store that also had very good build quality, but was told Yamaha is more consistent.)  I had seen comments that the F335 strings are too close together, and I think they are spaced tighter than most models, but not by a lot, and it has not been a problem.  Only wish I have is that the F335 had a strap knob at the neck joint.  Yamaha has a fine line of musical instruments, and while the F325 (silver tuning keys) and F335 (gold tuning keys) are its entry-level acoustic guitars, I think Yamaha has delivered a great sounding, well-built guitar for the price.

An acoustic that I can carry on my bike, take to the park, take camping or to a party and not worry too much about having it damaged or stolen. I tried out several guitars at Guitar Center in the $100-$200 price range and this Yamaha won handily over other guitars in the price range I tried (such as Fender). When I bought the guitar at GC they gave me a new one still in the box. I took it home and found that the guitar creaked: the baffle was loose and applying slight pressure to the body made it creak. When I hooked up a strap and tried to play it I sounded as if I were standing on a creaky old wooden stair. I promptly took that guitar back to GC and asked them for the one on the shelf that I played. So: if you order this online take some time to really inspect it before committing to it, there may be some quality control issues from one to the next.

Out of the box the Yamaha F335 was set up perfectly and ready to play, no adjustments needed other than tuning (which I am thankful for because my local music store charges $50 to set up an instrument).

A few days ago I replaced the original string that came on it with Ernie Ball 2146 Acoustic Regular Slinky String Set (12, 16, 24, 32, 44, 54) and WoW, I thought the guitar sounded good with the factory installed strings!

I tried some of the various designated travel guitars, and thought the Baby Taylor was just plain bad sounding. I liked the Martin Backpacker, but there I was in the $200 range and I just didn't want to drop the coin. I looked at some cheap off-brand guitars and they sounded tinny and, well, cheap. Then I spotted this Yamaha on sale and was impressed. I mean, at this price point there is not much competition. I've definitely stroked some more expensive guitars that did not feel as nice. It seems well made, looks nice, sounds clean and has easy action. Nothing bad here. Of course, it does not sound like my Martin, no way Jose! Nor does it feel like my Martin, so don't have any illusions there, either. But it does what it does very cleanly and without presenting any problems, so how can you possibly go wrong? If it gets dinged or scratched, no biggie. My daughter liked it so well I gave it to her and it will serve her very nicely as a guitar to learn on.

I can also confirm for you that I have heard no full sized guitar at this price point that sounds as good.My daughter can easily form chords and practice without tiring or damage to her fingers, she cannot do this with any of my full size guitars.  As she ages I am sure I will give her one of my full size guitars and she will leave this behind but it is fulfilling its purpose by letting her learn to play without pain or any of the other difficulties ecountered when a child plays a full sized acoustic guitar.If you go into the purchase with the right expectations I am sure you will not be disappointed in this well built, 3/4 scale guitar from Yamaha.

I've owned this guitar for years and bought it as my beach guitar. I've owned many small guitars including the Applause 1/2 size and I also own a Baby Taylor. Side by side with the Taylor, it far exceeds expectations for a guitar that costs 1/3 the price. It's remarkably playable, tunes up perfectly and holds up after several seasons of playing on the beach and being lugged around in a backpack without a case. Don't compare any small guitar to a full-sized guitar when it comes to sound quality and volume; or to more expensive small guitars.  Also trashing the guitar because it has steel strings is beyond ridiculous. It's a steel string guitar, and as such it requires beginners to play for a short time each day until they develop callouses. One additional tip, small scale guitars benefit from heavier strings since they provide more tension and volume, and tune up better.

I went to Guitar Center and played every sub-size guitar they had, expecting to spend something in the $3 - $400 range, and was astonished to find that this guitar had the best tone and playability of any - at a discounted price of $129.  I've read all the other reviews here, and think that most share my view.  The handful of complaints can be chalked up to some combination of:- Unreasonable expectations or non-guitarists (e.g., \"shouldn't have steel strings for a kid,\" which opinion you may or may not share, but you can just restring)- Individual instrument may have been defective (one observation of finish issues) or required some adjustment (buzzing in one review).My STRONG recommendation for anyone is to go to a large guitar store and play everything they've got in the size range.  Then you'll know what's available in the category and, critically (since there is probably a LOT more quality variation in a $100 guitar than a $3,000 guitar) be able to play the exact instrument you're actually going to purchase.I couldn't believe that the guitar I bought could be produced and sold at this price."],["This guitar was a birthday present for my daughter who desperately wants to learn how to play the guitar and write her own songs.

I have had several guitars.  While it is possible to buy a $130 guitar that is o-kaaay, you still need a luthier to set it up.

They really struggle with holding the instrument in a proper position. This guitar is large enough that an adult can play it - although a little cramped. It has a straight neck, the fret finish is good, and it is reasonably easy to fret.It does not sound very full because of the small body but the sound is pleasing enough. My biggest compaint would be the tuning machines are cheap and it is more difficult for the guitar to stay in tune than it should be. As is a problem with most short-scale instruments, it does not intonnate well, but it does the job. Chords are reasonably in tune up to the 9th or 10th fret. That is fine for an instrument of this type and probably far superior to a lot of other guitars in this price range.I would like to see the addition of an on-board tuner, or at least an option. This would have added $15 or so to the price but would have been worth it. As is, I bought a mountable tuner of eBay and cut a hole in the guitar and it works well. If you are not that compfortable doing that, buy one of the ones that clip on the headstock.Also do not attempt to but ultra-light strings on this guitar, it will not stay in tune.

When in tune, it sounds fine. Compared to my full size Yamaha, this guitar goes out of tune more frequently, probably because the hardware is a little cheap. However, I tune this sucker up with my cheap Koirg tuner in under a minute, and my son is making good progress in his guitar lessons on it. Like I said, when in tune it resonates nicely and sounds nice. It also has pegs at either end of the sound box for a strap, unlike my full size guitar that only has a peg at one end (?!).

I find the sound, quality and finish unbelievable for a guitar at this level."],["My 5-1/2-year-old daughter just started taking lessons 2 months ago, and this Yamaha is a great fit for her needs. Crisp tonality and ability to stay tuned make the guitar a great purchase for us. Her teacher highly recommends this guitar, as it can easily be played by an adult as well, meaning that the life of the guitar isn't limited as the student becomes older. In fact, its smaller size (read: portability) makes this my go-to guitar to play (over my own guitar) at the children's ministry at church.The only downside is the thin gigbag. Because my daughter is so young, she doesn't exercise as much caution with the guitar as I would like (which is a testament to how well it stays tuned). I'm looking into the better endowed Taylor Guitars Baby Gig Bag so the Yamaha can outlast my daughter's 5-year-old tendencies.I highly recommend the Yamaha FG JR1 3/4 size acoustic guitar for both young and old.Update 3/15/13: I got the following case for my daughter: SKB Baby Taylor/Martin LX Soft Case with EPS Foam Interior/Nylon Exterior, Back Straps. Purchase price was superb, especially in comparison to the Baby Taylor Gig Bags.Now 6 years old, my daughter is happily progressing in her musical pursuits, all thanks to this great guitar."],["The JR1 guitars were just what I expected and needed to teach my twin grandchildren how to play. Very little tuning was needed to get them up and performing. The girls love them."],["Originally had my 9-year old try a full sized acoustic guitar.  It was almost as big as her.  The store expert recommended this one and she loves it!  The size is just right and she doesn't feel overwhelmed like she did with the full-sized guitar.  She loves it and hasn't been able to put it down.  It's perfect for lessons, is easy to tune and sounds really good and rich despite the size.  Good things do come in small packages.  when she outgrows it in a couple years, I'll pass it down or trade it in for a larger model, but for now, it's perfect.  She's already mastered several chords on her own and she's about to start formalized lessons.

The box arrived with a little damage and a huge boot print on it. I thought the worse. Pleasantly to my surprise, everything was intact. The guitar and gig bag where in excellent shape.  I tuned the guitar and it has been holding tune and it sounds great.

Very glad we went with yamaha."],["Just for background: I am not a professional musician, but I have been playing guitar and piano for over forty years. I own several guitars. I just purchased this for my nine-year-old daughter. I had originally ordered a Luna Aurora Faerie guitar but sent it back. The Luna was mostly plastic and assembled so poorly, that calling it anything but a toy would be untrue. The Yamaha is another story. It actually has a spruce top, wooden bridge and adjustable truss bar. It is a real guitar in every sense of the word. It is a true 3/4 scale guitar despite was others with little or no knowledge of guitars have posted. The out-of-box action (string height) is good and can be played \"as is.\" For a better experience, it should be taken to a guitar shop and adjusted (set up) properly. Action is adjusted by raising or lowering the neck or bridge nut, not by adjusting the truss rod - as many people attempt to do.As to the sound, it's great! A 3/4 scale guitar is not going to project loud, but it's tone is very pleasing. I would recommend getting light strings (11-47 or thinner) for a beginner. The guitar stays in tune well, I have not had a problem with the tuners as others have claimed. The neck and frets are first class. The size is perfect for a child. All in all this guitar is great. For the money, or even for several hundreds more, you will not find a better guitar. I highly recommend it."],["Our son started guitar lessons a few months ago and this has been the perfect size and type of guitar for him to start with.  It's well made and has a nice sound, we haven't had any problems with it.  The protective case that comes with it is very practical, we use it all the time.  The only complaint I have is that the zipper on the case gets stuck on the inside fabric so I had to trim it."],["I have several acoustic guitars. This is one of my favorites for the simple reason that the string action is excellent for a stock inexpensive guitar.  This is an great guitar for the beginning player as the strings are set low on the neck. There is no difficulty in fretting the strings. The Yamaha FG JR1 3/4 size acoustic guitar has a nice feel to it when holding it in my lap. It is very lightweight and has a beautiful finish. It is a good buy and sells currently at the local Guitar Center with/bag at the price offered via Amazon. I give this little guitar 5 Stars."],["We bought this for our grandson and it is a decent 3/4 size acoustic guitar for a young beginner. He is just 4 but can hold it and strum it with ease. I like the fact that it holds its tune pretty well and doesn't sound tinny or cheap like some smaller guitars. I think he will like it and be able to learn some basic chords and strums on it. I have given guitar lessons to children for years and would recommend this as a good beginner instrument.Lauren"],["This guitar was a very good purchase for my nephew.  He really enjoyed it and it was a fast shipment and in great condition when it arrived which means to me that it was packed well. Would use this seller again."],["I am basically an advanced beginner, having started out about a year and a half ago on the Yamaha 3/4 Size Classcal Guitar (with nylon strings.)  Also taking lessons.  I recently purchased this Yamaha FG 3/4 Size Accoustic Guitar.In my opinion, it has good intonation, has a more than decent rich sound to it.  It is definitely not a \"toy\" guitar.  After about five tunings at the beginning, it has held its tune well--only very few tweaks. The action is low without buzzing, which is good for tender finger tips, and just plain, overall fretting. I have to agree with some of the reviewers who believe this to be smaller than a 3/4 size guitar.  This one is pretty small.  I don't think it's 3/4 size--more of a half-size. I am only 5 feet tall, female, with small frame and fingers, and I find the distance between the strings to be a bit of a tight squeeze.  Distance in frets is okay for my stature.I was worried that going to a steel string accoustic guitar would be painful on the tips of my fretting fingers since I have nerve damage in my fingers--one of the reasons I started off on the Yamaha 3/4 size classical with nylon strings (which is a great nylon string guitar for beginners), but I don't realize any difficulty or pain with this steel string guitar.  I have calluses by now, but even so, for one just starting out on a steel string, I don't think it's any more painful than starting out on nylon strings.A setup by a luthier, I don't think it is at all necessary unless you are at least an intermediate, at which point you probably own a $500+ guitar that has a louder sound (I think this one has more than average projection, and aginn, intonation).  Besides a bit of a problem with the string-to-string closeness, the only other thing I can think of is the fretboard, compared to the overall size of the guitar, and the body, is more than average heavy--not a real biggie, but I thought I'd mention it.Because of its small size, if you are taller than five feet, or have average or large hands, I can't give it five stars.  If you know enough about guitars and think you can handle a guitar this size, I would give it five stars, especially for a small child.All in all, if you are looking for a beginner steel string accoustic guitar, especially for a child just starting out, I don't think you could go wrong with this guitar. You get a real guitar at a very good price, that's pretty vibrant, while keeping in mind that it is on a small scale.  Here, I would give it five stars.If I had a child who wanted to start playing a steel string accoustic guitar, I would not hesitate to purchase this guitar.  If you are taller than five feet, or have large fingers, I do feel this good guitar would be a bit of a tight squeeze, and also possibly not as comfortable to hold.  If, on the other hand, you want to purchase a very nice quality guitar without shelling out big bucks, especially for a beginner, I would highly recommend this guitar."],["This product cracked in 6 weeks.  We just use it for Guitar lessons, it had a crack in it and showed up now.  When I contacted Best service they said I only had 30 days the return it, are they kidding.  Do not buy this from them."],["This little guitar sounds and plays great!  I got this for my Granddaughter who is 8 and she and I love it.  The intonation is just perfect, it tunes up easily and sounds great.  Highly recommended.  I may buy one for myself for campouts and road-trips, because it is so small it travels well.  Great price for a really nice small guitar."],["This is an excellent little guitar.  It is well made and sounds pretty good for it's size.  The tuners work well; they're snug and turn smoothly.  The result is that the guitar says decently in tune from one day to the next.  This is a weak spot in many 3/4 scale entry level guitars.  Frets all seem level, neck is straight, and there is no noticable fret buzz.  Action is pretty good right out of the box on mine."],["Just needed to be tuned, but other than that it has stood the test of time. My daughter truly enjoys using this item and I think I would order same brand name again if needed for the future."],["One of the other reviewers complained that their guitar teacher called this a \"1/4 sized guitar\" and it appeared that they felt they had gotten a bad deal.  No, it is a 3/4 sized guitar - this is based on scale length and not overall size of the guitar - but it is small.  This guitar has a 21 1/4\" scale (normal is about 26\" but it varies), a 12 1/2\" lower bout and a 9\" upper bout.  This places it in the parlor size category, more or less, and it fits a child well.This is a fully functioning guitar with a solid spruce top, decent craftsmanship, and an adjustable truss rod.  The action is acceptable (although it needs setup at the nut) and the tone is, well, there.  You are never going to confuse the Yamaha FG JR1 for a $3000 Taylor.  It is a $120 guitar.  The main virtues are its size, playability, and price.  For that $120 you get a well made, well designed small guitar suitable for all ages with enough tone and volume to hold its own in a small group.  You can take it aboard any plane and place it in the overhead rack.  If you are sitting around the campfire and have to fight off a bear with it, you are only out $120 and it is sturdy enough to tolerate at least one swing.The adjustable truss rod lets you change the relief of the neck in all sorts of conditions (assuming you are brave enough to do so) and a little filing on the nut by your luthier (don't try this at home unless you have some experience) will make it very playable for both finger style and pick.So it is not the top of the line, it works well for what it was intended to be.  It sure beats the heck out of the so-called travel guitars which all sound like they are made from cardboard and look like the set designer of Avatar or LOTR produced them for orcs.  If you are looking for a quality small guitar but are too cheap to pay for one, give the Yamaha FG JR1 a look."],["Sounds pretty good for the price, but the tuning didn't hold, the factory strings were crap, but new strings will solve that tuning problem. My son is 5 and learning, It fits good in his hands."],["A very nice little guitar for my nearly-13 year-old son. I tuned it when it arrived (within a week of ordering) using the Snark SN-1 I ordered with it and he played around on it every day until his first lesson last night. His instructor commented that it was a nice guitar and said it was comfortable even for him and would make a nice traveling instrument for adults. Incidentally, he also said the Snark tuner was one of the best on the market--he has an identical one himself. Back to the guitar, my son learned his first notes last night and my wife and I have been entertained by the openings of &#34;Smoke on the Water&#34; and &#34;Amazing Grace&#34; since then.  He loves this guitar! Thank you to those of you who answered my questions before I purchased this.  It was money well spent!"],["I have been playing guitar for over 40 years, and have owned a JR1.  Mine did need to be intonated but otherwise sounded okay for the size.  Also I'd definitely recommend a string change, but then I change strings on most of my guitars when I buy them.  I did feel that using either Martin Silk and Steel or DR Rare phosphor bronze strings improved the tone of this little guitar and made it sound pretty good.  It's small, probably small enough to fit in overhead storage, but my 6' 7\" husband played it regularly with no problem, and although I prefer a wider neck, I also had no problem with this guitar.  The coolest thing - since it is priced so low, I have no problem leaving it out on a stand or playing it on the porch or anywhere.Very handy little guitar, definitely not a toy.  Good guitar if you need something small or inexpensive, or both."],["Nice guitar for a little kid. I got for my 8 year old son and he loves it. Its small but thats what he wanted."],["I got this for my 14yo daughter as a first instrument.  It tuned easily and has a nice sound, and the 3/4 size makes it easy to handle for her. All in all, it was one of the best gifts I could have made."],["This guitar is good for a 5-9 year old.  It's a beautiful guitar but a small 3/4 size guitar.  The scale length of an average 3/4 guitar should be around 22.75\" and this only has a 20-21\" scale length.  That makes a difference if you are looking to fit a 9-12 year old.Other than the scale length, I would say this is a good guitar.  So if you are looking for a young child and want a step up from a toy, then this would be your choice."],["Got this for our 7 year old. It seems like a very good quality guitar with a very good sound."],["This really is an awesome value for an acoustic guitar at $100 or less.  I bought mine at Music and Arts on Black Friday for $79 + tax.The frets are really easy to play, easier than an electric guitar at a similar value.  Hard to believe that such a low cost acoustic guitar can play so well.  The tone is very good and the sound is decent.  We have 4 electrics, and I find myself going to this one a lot when I am just practicing alone.  I had bought it for my son who has an electric.  I wanted something easier for him to just sit and quickly play.  I am very glad I bought this guitar.I will try to update in 6 months to tell you how well it is holding up.  So far, my wife, our 6 year old, and myself have been playing it daily.  We all love it.My only complaint is the way the neck strap hangs - it makes the neck slide right toward the ground if you are not holding onto it.  It is so light that you really don't feel it when you are playing.  Unlike the Epiphone SG where the neck is unbalanced like this, but you feel it while you are playing and it can be annoying.The first guitar I bought was a Schecter Diamond Series Omen-Extreme 6 (paid $250).  Later, I have purchased two other guitars that at some really great prices:Epiphone Les Paul Ultra II (paid $405),Epiphone SG Special (paid $90),My 6 year old son has his electric Ibanez Stratocaster 3/4."],["I'm very satisfied with this guitar, which I bought for my 8-year old son.  The tone is good and the guitar stays in tune.  It feels well-made in the hands.  We had a Mark II M2G-30SB 1/2-size guitar which we'd used for a year before this, and it didn't stay in tune (and it always had one sour string that never would get in tune, even with the help of an electronic tuner.  Changing the strings didn't help).  So I'm very pleased with the Yamaha.  It's great quality at an affordable price.  We purchased the guitar through the Guitar Center website, which had free shipping.  It comes with a soft case.  The only criticism I have, and it's a minor one, is that I wish the case had at least one pocket on it for picks and such.  But it's a well-made case otherwise.

I've gotten pretty good now, and I figured it's time to graduate to a nicer model. I went to the guitar store told them I'm looking in the $500 range. I tried out several the Seagull models (which I wanted to like more, just because it's made in Canada), an ovation, an Alvarez, a Fender, but I kept coming back to the Yamaha FG730. It just sounded, played, and felt so nice! It was amazing that the price was about half of some of the other guitars I was playing! Every other guitar I tried kept getting compared back to the Yamaha. Even my daughter, who came with me, kept saying, &#34;no, that one doesn't sound as nice as the Yamaha either, dad.&#34; So, surprised at my selection, I bought the Yamaha.Here's what I like: The sound is amazing! It has a loud punch of you want it, but it can be subtle if you tickle the strings. When you're playing softly you can still hear each string clearly, even the high E. Beyond the sound, the tuner handles are a little larger than other models, making fine tune adjustments much easier to do, the action is nice and low, but without any fret buzz (even with a capo on it), the gloss finish really shows off the wood, and the abalone shell makes the sound hole and headstock sparkle. The only potential negative I can see in it is very minor, and that is that the strap button on the bottom was a little loose, and started to pull out when I put a strap on it. It did not come out, though, and its an extremely minor issue.I love this guitar, and would recommend to anyone looking in any range under $600. If you go over that, you're in a different class, but under that mark, this is probably the best all-around guitar, and it's probably the cheapest to boot!"],["Great sound. Decent setup. So so strings. Beautiful!Overall very pleased.

That said, this is my third guitar and by far the best yet. It's beautiful and sounds great! I plan on keeping this guitar for quite a while as I continue my progression. I play around the house and some small gatherings, but will never be a stage performer and don't want to be. But, for me, this is a nice sounding and looking instrument and I'm happy to show it off to my friends. I've always been very wary of Chinese made merchandise, but this is made in the Yamaha factory in China and the quality is top notch! I know something about quality having worked in manufacturing quality control for 30 years. I recommend this guitar to anybody who wants a nice guitar for under $300.00!"],["This guitar is just as good, if not better, than the 100-300 series Taylor guitars at a fraction of the price. Beautiful tone, perfectly placed action allowing for beautiful notes no matter how high on the neck, gorgeous guitar (I got the natural color), Auditorium-like shape allows for great volume while the softer notes are flawless. Great for either finger-picking or strumming. The electronics, of course, aren't the best, but they are still pretty good. I mainly play without plugging up, so that makes no difference to me. I like the option of being able to plug up if I need to, but the pure acoustic sound (which this guitar so richly provides) is more my taste. Built-in tuner is an obvious plus, allowing for quick adjustments of off notes (which doesn't happen often, because this guitar stays in tune very well). I am picky when it comes to the cut-away, and the cut-away that this baby sports is perfect.I've played the higher end Taylors before, so I obviously know that the 600-800 series Taylor are gonna sound better, but these ratings are based mainly on the bang for the buck that I got out of this guitar:Tone: 10... Like previously stated, this guitar's tone is as good if not better than the $800-$1600 Taylor guitars. I had wanted a Taylor for a long time. I had my eye on the Taylor 114ce for it's beautiful tone. Though it was the lowest end of the Taylor guitars, it was still $850. When I found the Yamaha fjx730sc, I picked it up and played it, and thought \"wow, this sounds better than the Taylor\" so I assumed it would be a more expensive guitar. Looked at the price tag... $560.Feel: 10... The action on the guitar is perfect. Just high enough not to buzz, while staying just low enough to make you barely have to touch the strings to play them. Hammers sound and feel great. The back of the neck makes your hand glide. The cut-away makes you literally feel like the instrument is a part of you, and not just something you're holding. Sound weird? Just wait til you play one.Look: 10... I'm not gonna lie. This is one of the most beautiful guitars I've ever seen. Without all the frill and fluff and gold inlay (which looks ugly in my opinion). The auditorium shape is awesome-looking, the finish is perfect, even the head-stock looks awesome without being in the way.Electronics: 8... Like I said, the pick-ups are pretty dang good for the price. The built-in tuner is an awesome addition.Overall: 10... This is the 2nd guitar that I've ever owned. My first guitar was a cheapy step up from First Act. While it had decent tone, it lacked in playability because of the high action and lack of electronics. I got the action fixed, and while it became a lot easier to play, the tone was still not at my skill level. My new Yamaha fjx730sc makes me literally want to play the guitar all day because of how beautiful it sounds. This is the kind of guitar that will leave people with their jaws on the floor."],["Been wanting this guitar for many years and it's everything I hoped for. The sound, the feel and ease of playing is so much better than my old beat-up guitar. Great price, thank you, and fast delivery. Love it!"],["This guitar is a great value for under $300. I've owned this guitar for several years and it still impresses me how good it sounds. I was looking for an acoustic and played everything in Guitar Center under $400. It really did amaze me how much better this guitar played and sounded compared to everything else in the price range. Everything else I could play sounded cheap and tinny. This guitar projects and sounds great - very full deep tone.I originally wanted to get the sunburst finish version of this yamaha before playing the natural finish. Maybe I just played a dud or the burst finish muffles the resonance of the wood, but the natural version sounded so much better than the sunburst that I had to get it, despite not looking as cool :).I'm giving 5 stars because for the price it's an incredible guitar that feels and plays like other guitars twice the price. Four years later it still sounds and looks great."],["The construction and cosmetic look of this guitar is excellent. Good sound and sustain.Only problem I have is that the Yamaha FG-730SGuitar deserves better tuning machines. The ones installed on my FG-730S are not of the quality the guitar should have.That is my only problem with this guitar."],["I Was playing a Takamine G Series EG340SC, until I picked this up, I like this guitar so much better in everyway."],["Yes, it's a Chinese guitar - I won't go into the political/economic aspects of it other than to say that I struggled purchasing this for that reason.  Let's talk about the guitar on it's merits as a musical instrument.Tone -  Beautiful traditional dreadnought tones.  Not as dark or boomy as a Gibson DN, not as bright as a Taylor DN.  Really nicely balanced and articulate.  If you sat down in an acoustic room with a bunch of guitars, this one would certainly float to the top in this category, no matter the price.Playability - The setup and fret job are extremely good.  Maybe not quite as polished as higher end guitars, but playability-wise no complaints at all.  The string spacing is different than on my Taylor, which makes this feel a little off for me - but this is strictly a preference thing so some might like this better.  The rosewood fretboard is pretty slick - I don't really notice a functional difference between it and my preferred material (ebony).  Perhaps the only negative note in my review - the fretboard binding is not rounded, so it can feel slightly uncomfortable in some situations.  Again, this is a personal preference - I've experienced squared-off binding like this on high end guitars as well.Construction - The neck and body are solid and the bracing is basic, but solid.  The neck construction seems less than ideal, but is probably as stable as anything else unless it suffers a big impact.  It would be nice if they had mounted a second strap button.Aesthetics - Overall, the guitar looks great.  The sunburst is done well - many pictures of these guitars make the sunburst look pretty bad - it's great in person.  The guitar I received (Tobacco Brown Sunburst) is darker than pictures would indicate - which I like.  The inlays look great and the gloss finish on the body/headstock is to a high standard.  The binding in places is a tad messy, but overall this is a pretty classy looking guitar.  The laminate rosewood back is nicely grained and dark.It's unbelievable to me that this guitar is under $300 considering the features and details (no matter where it's built).  On it's merits as an instrument, it's unassailable."],["This is my first guitar, as I recently decided to start learning guitar, and I must say i am impressed with the FG730s. Mine came ready to play from the box, the action was great, just needed some tuning. Overall it feels quite sturdy and the color (Natural) is really nice looking. Something that i like is that it holds tune really well so i can just play a lot without having to tune it constantly. I don't really have any other guitar to compare it to (except a really cheap guitar at my friend's house that sounds awful) so to my ears the Yamaha FG730s sounds great.

Excellent fit and finish."],["I received this guitar as a gift a few years ago and it is my favorite guitar acoustic or electric. I have been playing over 30 years and fell in love with this guitar immediately. The tone is so full and the action is perfect. I have other guitars where I've had to lower the action and fool around to get it to my liking. This was perfect right out of the box. I've had friends that own Martin and Taylor guitars play it and just smile at the full tone and playability. Every player that has tried it just stops after playing a few minutes and says \"This guitar sounds great.\" I play it through a Fender Acoustasonic Amp and just LOVE it. The ease of playing on the high frets is so smooth. The guitar does not fall out of tuning when playing several songs and is just a JOY to play.

It is probably THE most reviewed guitar (check it out at guitarcenter.com for example); and most of those reviews are very positive.Yes, it's made in China, which arguably is a mental hurdle for many of us - but that's pretty much the only negative, and then, you could probably argue that such quality at this price cannot be made anywhere else, and you'd probably be right.I love the color - it's deeper and darker that the pictures suggest. I had originally ordered the 'natural' (light) color, but much prefer this one.Soundwise, I'm no expert, but it sounds very good to me, and I'm extremely satisfied with the purchase, and with Amazon shipping and return service which has never failed me."],["I have been playing guitar off and on for 30 something years...I'm not that good.  This guitar has made my playing better than any other guitar.  The low's are excellent and the low E stays perfectly tuned and playable.  The sound is not really warm but it is full and you can distinguish the highs from the lows.  I am finding it a little difficult to blend in a middle tone nicely.I have small hands and need a small neck.  This neck works very well for me and I think anyone with small hands size 6 and larger will enjoy playing this.  The strings are not easy on the finger tips though.  If you want nice clean sound from your notes, you really need to press painfully for a bit, unless your fingers have already taken the abuse.I have not noticed any fret buzzing except for when I don't cleanly play.  The set-up on the guitar is perfect.I don't know if the strings are a big deal. Lots of people say change them..the stocks are old and rusting.  It plays pretty well with them, but my A string near the 1st fret has a small sign of rusting.The guitar is comfortable for a full size guitar.  I wouldn't want to be smaller than someone 5'2\" with an average stretch.  It has a nice full sound which actually plays better the louder you can play it, but is very enjoyable and clean played softly as well.If you are going for a full warm sound with a sense of rounded bass,  this would not be the pick...mahogany or cedar tops would do better.  But Sitka spruce is the standard and will produce clean balanced sound which is still very nice and probably more versatile.Check out some YouTube videos of the different Yamahas to see your preference.  I found the videos to be accurate to real life sound.Enjoy any way.."],["I purchased this guitar for my 16 year old daughter who plays competition piano. Prior to this guitar she had a Taylor baby which the strings were a bit too high over the fret board for her liking. The Yamaha FG730S model I bought is the vintage cherry sunburst model. I could not find a better sounding guitar under $800. The solid Sitka spruce top was a standout in the price point. The rosewood neck has a sandwiched plastic composite running under the rosewood fret board which reminded me of the Kawai pianos built with composites. The composite neck did not deter my purchase because I figured it would prevent neck bending. Although composite necks are not something you would find on a $2K Taylor Dreadnought that this guitar emulates at 1/10th of the price.As is it is indeed a fine playing instrument. I felt this guitar was worth investing a few bucks into. I upgraded the stock tuners with brass Grover's Trophy Tuners, Bone Bridge, Taylor ebony tuning pins abalone topped, and re-strung with D'Addario lights. Finished it off aesthetically with a gold strap button to match the tuner, and now I have a $300 guitar with $200 with of upgrades that looks gorgeous and sounds like a $2000 high end Dreadnought.Prior to customizing the guitar it looked, felt, and played at a 4 star rating when compared to a $2K Taylor. After the investing $200 in upgrades it looks, sounds and feels similar to a 5 star Taylor Dreadnaught. All in all for $500 total this is a guitar that my teenage kid can take to outings and I won't be afraid of her telling me it needs a repair. After a little customizing this is a guitar that anyone whom appreciates fine sounding accoustic guitars would be proud to own. Looking forward to a lifetime of ownership.What a Deal!!!"],["I bought this guitar after trying out a bunch of them out at a local music store. I tried out a few in my price range and then made the mistake of trying out an $800 Martin. I knew when I played it that the deep resonance and rich low-ends had ruined me on cheaper guitars. Then, I picked up this guitar. That clear bass against your chest is here in this guitar for a fraction of the price of the more expensive guitars. It's not equal, but it's incredible given the price difference. I highly recommend this for the ridiculous price:quality ratio."],["I went to Guitar Center today. I tried at least 15 acoustic guitars. I chose the yamaha FG730S because it sounds great, it looks great, it feels great, its well made, and the price is right. Its made in China, its got a rosewood back and sides and spruce top. Believe me, Mahogany or Nato Guitars dont sound as good as good ol rosewood guitars. In addition, its got pretty decent inlays. I feel kind of lucky today because i bought the last one."],["Not being an expert in guitars, I turned to my music friends for a recommendation on a first guitar for my teenage daughter.

It is a great guitar and has served me beautifully for that time. I wanted to upgrade so I went online and bought a Taylor 110 Dreadnought for $649.00. It cost another $130 to ship it to the Caribbean where I live. Only now could I really appreciate the Yamaha. For starters the finish is superior to the Taylor. It has inner support bracings where the Taylor has none. The exterior finish is way better and the tuning keys are equal to the Taylor. It has a smoother neck and better action than the Taylor. It has a slightly bigger sound-box and more substantial feel. The tone quality of the Yamaha is very good but it is the only area I would rate the Taylor better. The Taylor is a little louder and boomier but not by much. And certainly not by a price difference that is nearly three times the amount. This Yamaha is such a great value and a great instrument. I am not sure if to sell the Taylor at a further loss and keep the Yamaha. But I feel Taylor has to give buyers more value than they do right now, at least at their base model 110 which starts at $649.00."],["I just bought this guitar for my wife.

I plan on changing the factory plastic saddle with a bone saddle once my funds have been replenished. And that can only add to my satisfaction with this instrument.You know that feeling you have after you've made a sizable purchase... wondering if you made the right choice?

Thanks!!!"],["I've had my guitalele (I've named him \"Steve\") for about three months now, and I gotta tell you, life without Steve would be a sad one indeed. It's incredibly light, and even tinier than I anticipated (roughly the size of my chihuahua mix. yes, we took measurements), but produces a huge, booming, cheerfulness-inducing sound. You cannot keep a straight face while playing this instrument. Smiling like a goof is mandatory. The case it comes with is perfectly nice, and from there I just throw it in my messenger bag with the neck sticking out a bit and go about my business. Especially as someone who lives, works, and plays in NYC, having a travel-friendly instrument is beyond amazing. Everywhere I take it, everyone wants to borrow itOther reviewers have covered the technical aspects, so I'm just gonna say that I enjoy the living daylights out of playing this thing. It is so much fun. It's not like a travel guitar, where you make sacrifices for the sake of portability and still have to deal with the freakishly long neck and horrible tinfoil sound. It's a 'real' guitar, just tiny. The neck is pretty darn close to standard size, just shorter scale, and the uke/classical-guitar-style tuners means it stays in tune much more reliably even when it's getting jostled around. It sounds huge. When I record with it, I don't even need to mic it separately because it booms loud enough to be heard over my voice (and I have a big mouth).I've also found it incredibly convenient to play. Because it's bigger than a standard uke, it fits perfectly under my arm, and I can easily stand and sit and play or even walk around and play without needing a strap or anything. (If you have really long arms or something, this may not be the case for you.) This allows me to irritate my roommates, mariachi-style, which I'm sure they appreciate.Seriously, it's practical, fun, and happiness-inducing. best $100 I ever spent in my musical career. Go Team Steve!(If you want to hear what it sounds like, here is a video I made. It's via webcam so the audio quality is not good at all but even through that, you can still hear how awesome it sounds.[...]I'm not sure if youtube links are okay on Amazon, so if it gets deleted, just go to youtube and search for guitalele and you'll get tons and tons of demo videos.)"],["This little thing is one of my dearest possessions!!I've played guitar as a hobby off and on for about 18 years and have a couple of full-sized acoustics. About a year ago I started researching smaller instruments because I wanted something easy to travel with. I looked into 1/4 size student guitars and I looked into the Little Martin and its Taylor equivalent. While the Little Martin has great reviews and a great sound, it costs 3-4 times more than this little guy does. It's definitely worth that price, but I didn't have that kind of money to spend. For about $100, the Yamaha Guitalele is excellent.It has a beautiful sound and it's very easy to pick up and take it with you on trips! (To keep it safer for long trips I bought a hard shell tenor uke case which works really well for it. I also bought one of those little Snark clip-on tuners and have been very satisfied with that as well.)Two things which take some adjusting to if you are used to playing a full-size guitar:1) The strings are a lot closer together and your fingers may feel fat and clumsy at first. I got used to this pretty fast though.2) The guitalele is tuned to A instead of the standard E tuning of a full-sized guitar. Basically this means anything you play on the guitalele is like playing your reg. guitar with a capo on the 5th fret. So when you play a C-shape chord on this guy, you are actually playing a G chord. I was used to playing a lot of songs on my regular guitar and had to figure out how to translate them to continue playing them in the same key. (It's possible to lower the tuning to E if you want, but the strings have a slack, kind of rubbery sound and they don't stay in tune as long.)I'd recommend checking out the YouTube video reviews for this instrument before you buy it if you have any more questions. You can hear what it sounds like and get some expert input! It really is great. I love mine to the moon and back and have had a blast playing it!"],["I got this as gift for my 7 year old and thought I could use it as well.I must have tuned it several times but as soon as you start playing the tuning was off. I had to return it.Good overall quality and came with a nice bag to hold it."],["I'd seen this on Amazon before and considered getting it, and one day I saw it at a local guitar store, so I picked this up and started playing it. I was so impressed with the sound that I just had to bring it home with me. I won't say where I got it, but it was the same price as here on Amazon, which is very reasonable. This really is a cute little instrument. It's light and easy to travel with, and I take it everywhere with me. I usually play steel string acoustic and have the calluses to prove it, so the nylon strings are weirdly easy for me to play. For those wondering, because it has classical-style tuning machines, steel strings aren't an option on this baby, and they wouldn't sound right anyway. That said, it has a really nice sound. It's about the size of a baritone ukulele, so it doesn't have that smaller, higher sound most people associate with ukuleles; it's a little fuller of a sound than that. I took this to Colorado with me last summer and played it when I went camping with friends, and it was perfect for that. My sister and I have fun with this thing at home, too. Even though my Taylor GS Mini is technically a travel guitar, I'm so OCD about my guitars that I refuse to leave them in the car even for ten minutes; I have to be there with the AC or heater on making sure it stays at room temperature. That makes this baby an ideal option for me; I don't really have to worry about the investment so much. I don't leave it in the trunk for days on end, but I'm okay with leaving it there to grab dinner or something. That said, if something happened to it, I would definitely replace it. I have so much fun with this little thing! The only reason I gave it a 4 is because even though it is well-made, there are are some imperfections on the finish. They aren't visible, but you can feel them there. They've been there since the day I got it. But besides that, this is a surprisingly good-quality instrument. I would highly recommend it."],["I bought this with high hopes as I play both ukulele and guitar (Kamaka uke and Ramirez guitar) I have a need for a little backpack instrument and Yamaha is exceptional at its price in its lower line classical guitars.  Unfortunately, this instrument has very poor fretting and intonation even compared to a lower priced ukulele.  It is marginally acceptable for first position chords, but if finger picking or classical guitar or ukulele is your thing, you will be very disappointed.  Also, the frets are very cramped, more than either of my ukuleles and very hard to play, and I have very small hands. Construction is good at its price point but it has little resonance; again a medium priced uke sounds better. The neck needs a complete redesign and the instrument should be revoiced. A good guitarlele such as that built by KoAloha is about a thousand dollars so I was probably expecting too much."],["Cons:It seems to need frequent retuning (remember to tune it starting with A - like a guitar with a capo on 5th)Something appears to have gone loose on the inside and it rattles a little if I hit the strings hard, but I can probably fix that the next time I change the strings..Pros:This baby sounds amazing! - far beyond it's price tag.Obviously very portable.In my view these pros easily out-weights the cons and I do not hesitate to give it 5 stars."],["The Yamaha Guitalele is a great instrument for the price.  It's better quality than any acoustic guitar or ukulele I'm aware of at the same price point.  It definitely could use a fret dressing and the tuners aren't the greatest but that is expected even for instruments costing two or three times as much.I changed the stock strings to a set of D'Addario Pro Arte Extra Hard Tension (EJ44) after reading other reviews about how they improved tone and string tension when tuned like a guitar (EADGBE).  The tone may be better than stock but I disagree with other reviewers and find the string tension is virtually the same as stock.  As far as I can tell a few of the EJ44 strings are slightly larger (more tense) and a few are slightly smaller (less tense) than stock.  Do not expect tension to improve for EADGBE tuning.  I want to be able to tune like a guitar and tenor ukulele so extra hard tension strings are the only way to go for me regardless of which tuning is used...Or customize your own setup by purchasing individual strings if you want to get fancy.  I'll probably keep it tuned EADGBE for now but have no worries about tuning back up to ADGCEA (tenor ukulele) with these strings when I feel like it.  It won't risk snapping the bridge off any more than stock strings would since they are virtually the same."],["Where to begin? The guitalele is an instant classic. It sound is sweet yet humble and retains some of the best qualities of both instruments it takes its name from. It's a lot of fun to play and feels like the perfect sized instrument when placed next to a standard ukulele and guitar. I own a nice old Harmony baritone ukulele which has a similar sound, but the GL-1 actually has a shorter neck and is tuned higher. The guitalele at least for me is more enjoyable to play in part because of the increased number of strings which allows for all o' them fancy guitar chords.

Like most people, I enjoy a variety of music and so I play a few different instruments in addition to classical guitar. Trouble is, not very much of what I have learned on guitar translates to other instruments. Since the Guitalele has the same relative tuning as a guitar and since it has nylon strings and a fairly wide neck, I was hoping to have an instrument with not much of a learning curve. I was hoping for something I could take on a hike or on vacation easily.I was also hoping that since it is tuned higher than a classical guitar, I could get a good projection from this instrument and possibly have fun with it outdoors. Unfortunately, there are 2 problems here. The first problem is that since the scale of the instrument is so very short, the frets are close together and it is very difficult to play any of the guitar pieces I already know, even in the lower positions. The second problem is the tone : plink - plink - plink. This just did not work for me. I suppose you could use this for playing basic chords in the lower positions but the tone is just wretched. I guess the moral of the story is that $100 is too cheap for a real instrument but too expensive for a toy."],["If you are one of those people (like me) who have to read a billion reviews before you buy something, save your time and just read this one.First of all, This is soooo cheap (money wise) for what it is.

Where I go, It goes.Second, The description says you should change the strings like every 2 months or something. I have not had a problem with that at all. I haven't changed the strings since I've got it and it sound brand new! Honestly, When I first got my GL1 it did not stay in tune well. But, after like 2 hours of playing it was fine and now I rarely tune it.

It's supposed to be tuned from A, but I didn't know that at first and I tuned it from E (as per normal guitar) or D for a bit more tension and I LOVE that bendy sound!. I play fast off-beat vamping for comic songs and the slack at those lower pitches works great. I'm damping a lot so the over all effect is almost like a train chuffing - rounded and full of character. Tuned as intended (in A) it is more accurate with less of that slack character.

The sound is lovely and resonating, and quite different from a soprano or concert ukulele's playful sound - much more like a guitar.  It sounds somewhat similar to a tenor ukulele - I had been thinking about getting a tenor uke, but I'm glad I went with this instead.As a ukulele player, I haven't got the hang of using all 6 strings - I play the highest 4 strings, which are tuned like a ukulele (GCEA), and it makes songs I've played many times sound really different - which helps keep me motivated to keep practicing.  I especially like it for practicing songs with fingering rather than strumming, as I don't have the hang of muting the deepest strings so the other 2 strings kind of throw me.As a ukulele player, I thought this instrument would get me playing guitar again (after 10 years of not playing guitar), and I've heard that it's a good transition instrument for others, but for me, it just made me fall in love with the ukulele all over again."],["This was probably the best $99 I spent all year...No kidding!The guitar is totally playable, sounds great and fits in a suitcase for travel.Plus I get the sound of a uke without the learning curve.

I just want to start off by saying that this is not a cheap toy as I thought it would be, it is a well built piece of equipment, not top of the line. It has nylon strings, the ADG are wrapped and the CEA are not wrapped and you have to keep tuning it until the strings stretch but that needs to be done with a regular Ukulele. Tuned to ADGCEA, the GCEA are the same as a Ukulele and they added two base strings of AD. It is the same as a guitar with a capo at the fifth fret. The frets are a little closer than a regular guitar so I would recommend that if you have large hands or fingers to try a Guitalele out at a music store. I went online to Youtube and watched the Guitalele videos before I bought this and all the reviews were high. I like this and would recommend it to others who want a small guitar to jam with or just have some fun. For the price of this you can't go wrong but I still plan on buying a guitar when taking online lessons due to the fact you have to change the chords to match a regular guitar chord. Example a regular C chord will become a G chord on the Guitalele. I use a Snark Tuner to tune my Ukuleles and the Guitalele.Snark SN-2 All Instrument Clip-On Chromatic Tunerit is simple and easy to use. I bought two. I might post a short video later on.If you want a nice Ukulele to start out with use this one..Lanikai LU-21C Concert Ukuleleor a smaller one..Lanikai LU-21 Soprano UkuleleThen there is the Baritone Ukulele which is tuned the same as the 4 strings of DGBE on a guitar..Lanikai LU-21B Baritone Ukulele"],["It looks pretty and sounds nice. Product quality is great.I own concert and soprano ukuleles more expensive than $100. And they cant match the sound produced by guitalele's bigger body.I do not own a baritone ukulele to compare to. But i assume the extra bass strings do make a huge difference holding a chord.I wish the tuning was similar to a guitar. Its ok to pick up guitar books, but you gonna sound 4 tones higher.Also its not re entrant G, so even if you try to skip the bass, you will sound more like a guitar.It feels great on my hands. Smaller hands would find it perfect.update:You cant tune it like a regular guitar. Doing so made the strings too loose. So I changed the strings for some xtra hard tension D&Aacute;ddario ones, as someone advised, and the result was bad. The strings achieved better tension (still loose) but now they sound subpar.

After testing it out with the included strings I put on a set of D'Addario Pro Arte Extra Hard Tension strings and the guitar is very usable in standard tuning EADGBE.  The tension on the string is only slightly less than a standard set of strings tuned to ADGCEA.  The lows sound much better than I expected and although I bought this for my son's birthday to start him out on guitar, I think another may be coming for my birthday to keep in the car and bring on work trips."],["This is a great value for a practice and travel instrument.(I got mine with free shipping)Built like an instrument, not a toy, it is an interesting crossover between a high strung guitar and ukelele. Fun to play, easy to take along, stays in tune well enough, and it's only a hundred bucks. I bet if you bought one you would like it."],["I bought my Yamaha guitarlele about 2 years ago from Long & McQuade located in Canada.  It's the same as the one Amazon is selling here.  I teach classical guitar but have always loved the sound of ukulele.  My reason for buying this is because I don't have to learn how to play the ukulele and can play the guitarlele using the knowledge I already have - yea!It is very similar to a guitar in many important ways.  It has the same 6 strings tuned the same way.  However, and this is VERY important so please read carefully:  To get the best sound out of your new guitarlele you must tune each string up in pitch.  For example, let's take the 6th string (lowest) and tune it up to A instead of E.  Clip on your electronic guitar tuner and crank that string up a bit until the tuner reads \"A\".  It will be the same pitch as the actual 5th string on the guitar.So here's the breakdown on tuning each string:6th = A5th = D4th = G3rd = C2nd = E1st = AYou really need to to tune it this way because otherwise the strings are too floppy and you won't get that beautiful ukulele voice.  The action is very good and it will not be any harder to play.The instrument overall is fairly easy to play, especially in the lower positions.  I have trouble holding it because I'm used to holding a classical guitar so I always have to make adjustments to get used to it.  Barring chords especially higher up the neck is kind of tough because the frets are so close together so I usually play easier stuff.  Also, I have discovered that certain types of music really play well and others aren't so good.  Almost all Celtic music sounds great!  Christmas carols are lovely, but Spanish stuff doesn't sound so great, imho.  The instrument just doesn't have enough power to carry some types of music.  Blues are good, and very ancient sounding tunes like those that would have been played on a 4 course guitar from back around the 15th century sound really cool on the guitarlele.  It seems to be well constructed, the tuning gears work well, the action is good, frets are inserted straight and level so I really can't find anything to complain about, especially for the price.I would suggest keeping the tunes simple and have fun!  It's just like a little guitar with all the same strings and same number of frets. You will probably have to tie a strap on it to hold it in place but that's not absolutely necessary, especially for those of you who are accustomed to playing small stringed instruments.I took it camping over the summer and had a great time playing it around the campfire in the evenings, something I've always wanted to do!  I'm quite fond of my guitarlele and am going to purchase another for my daughter so that we can play duets together on them!  :DUPDATE 4.10.13-------------------------------------------------------------------------I bought another guitarlele (this time from Amazon) and it is exactly like the one I purchased a few years ago.  This one is for my daughter and she is having a delightful time playing it.  We've been playing guitarlele duets together and they sound great and is such a fun thing to do!"],["This guitar is great and comes with a great little case that is well-made, unlike some flimsy gig bags that come with other brands' products (although I wish it had a pocket on it to store strings, but, hey! It came with the guitar). It's a little hard for me to put my hand around the neck, but my hands are pretty small. The strings are very nice as far as I can tell (I am not an expert musician), and tune nicely. They are pretty tight, and a little hard to press down, but that might just be because it is a quality instrument and I am not very far along in my guitar-playing. My economy uke's strings were very cheap and it was easy to press the strings down. It is easier for me to play this guitar with a pick instead of just my fingers. The instrument is very beautiful and seems to be made with quality. It is not as small as a soprano ukulele, but is very pleasing to hear and can be quite loud for how small it is. It would be nice if it had a strap button installed on the bottom so I wouldn't have to hold it with my elbow while standing. I love, love, love this little guitar."],["Best purchase I've made all year. It sounds good and is surprisingly well made.  The matte finish is so-so, but I can't complain for the price.  I did change the guitalele to standard tuning using comments I found on Youtube.  I shifted D'Addario EJ45's 2B->1E, 3G->2B, 4D->3G, 5A->4D, 6E->5A and swapped the low E using a string from the EJ-46.  Works great!"],["Well made and sounds awesome!  I've paid a lot more money for guitars and ukes that didn't sound as good as this!  I highly recommend!"],["It has been said before but it will not stay in tune.

I have difficulty getting my smallish hands around a regular guitar fret board, but I didn't want to go full-out ukulele and only have four strings. I have no troubles playing any bar chords or keeping a grip on it.I've tuned mine a 4th higher than a regular guitar, like others suggested. It has a surprisingly big, warm, and cheerful tone. It's great to sing along with, and since it's so small it pretty much can go anywhere.I personally don't have any problems playing it, but others might find it difficult to play higher up on the neck (the frets get a little cozy up there). It holds tune decently well, though you might have to tune it up a little every now and again. I test it out and tune it by ear before each play like I would my guitar.It comes with a case that zips up along the bottom and has a little handle on the side, perfect for travel. Honestly, it's the best $90 I've spent on an instrument. You really can't go wrong, especially with the price."],["The Yamaha guitalele sounds absolutely beautiful. It's like a mini classical guitar, except the recommended tuning is A-D-G-C-E-A (A-D, followed by the standard G-C-E-A tuning on a 4-string Ukulele), but it can also be turned to E-A-D-G-B-E (standard tuning on a guitar).On the standard tuning for a guitar, however, the strings sound a little floppy. A reviewer suggested using an extra hard, high tension string like theD'Addario Extra Hard Tension Classical Guitar Stringsto get around the floppiness on the E-A-D-G-B-E turning. You can use a capo with this instrument. MyKyser Capoworks on it just fine.The guitalele measures 27-1/2\" x 9\" x 2-3/4\" at their widest points. The construction quality on my copy is tiptop except for a minute area (where the neck meets the soundboard), which is lighter in color because it missed an application of wood stain (not a big deal really). The guitalele has a satin (non-glossy) finish, which is a lot less prone to the unsightly scratches a high-gloss finish might incur.The package includes a black nylon gig bag.For a high quality instrument that costs a tiny fraction of the price for a full-size guitar, the Yamaha Guitalele GL-1 is a good buy (just under a Ninety as of this writing)."],["The Yamaha Guitarlele is a fun instrument.It is just midway between a toy and a musical instrument.I know there are other guitarleles (I think Kala has one) that are a bit more serious .

After reading most the 5-star reviews I was super stoked on this guitar, but it didn't even live up to my least expectation. Where to start? My biggest gripe is the sound, OH the sound!!! Now I realize this is a very small guitar and shouldn't expect it to sound like a holy orchestra, but seriously the Spruce does this thing no justice. It sounds like a tin can. If you're thinking of buying this, but are unsure of the sound quality. Find a tin can and put strings on it. Now strum.. That's what you're paying for..... I can barely make out an \"A\" chord the sound quality is so bad. Next the fret spacing is the size of a pencil eraser. Very small and easy to play the wrong chords when you're fingering is right. The guitalele is light though, about the weight of a sneaker shoe, and 3 feet in length, so it is relevant for travel. Also it does come with a small pack, that you can carry around like a briefcase. The action is decent and there's no fret buzz which surprised me. That is all the positive I got though. Okay, now if you are an intermediate guitar player and want something for travel that has quality sound. Invest in a Baby Taylor or a Martin Mini, just don't get this unless sound isn't an issue. I would recommend this Guitalele as a beginners guitar for any age between 4-13, it would make a great birthday present for a kid that's just learning guitar. But be warned. If you are an experienced musician looking for something with quality look elsewhere. No offense to anyone who owns this guitalele this is  my opinion, I'm just a casual guitar player who gigs live once a week. Not a professional rockstar or anything, so don't take my word for it. Anyone who doesn't own this stop by your local Guitar Center and give it a try. You'll know what you're buying first hand."],["Im a man on the move and am constantly away from home.

I play a baritone ukulele but felt I needed more strings. A regular guitar is just too large and bulky and the frets too far apart for me to play the chords comfortably.  This is just what I needed - very comfy to play in your lap.  I tuned it down 5 steps to regular guitar tuning (EADGBE) with the original strings and it does fine - I'll change to heavier gauge (Hard Tension) classical guitar strings (as some have suggested) when it comes time to change them out.  For less than $90, including gig bag and free shipping, this is a real bargain and it's nicely made.  It is not a $1,000 collector's item, so you can just enjoy it and not worry about getting a scratch on it.  I purchased a strap called the UkeLeash, which doesn't need a strap button and doesn't clip onto the soundhole - it's a unique design that goes around your arm. If you need amplification just use a tuner clip on one of the tuners and plug into any guitar amp - works great. It's light-weight and should travel well.  My husband was also impressed with this instrument and thinks it's a great deal.  Order one today and put a smile on your face!!"],["We bought this for vacation and it makes a great travel guitar.  It easily stowed in the carry-on luggage compartment even in the small planes we flew.  We bought a hardshell tenor sized \"UKE CRAZY\" case for it and it fits like a glove- absolutely perfectly.There's plenty of YouTube Videos that show the Guitalele being played and these things sound GREAT!  It's got a nice rich full sound and projects a lot of volume.  It has the \"Uke\" sound when strummed and also works great for fingerpicking.  It was set up pretty well when I purchased it, but I took it in and had the action lowered a bit which made it even nicer.  My tech also did a very small adjustment at the nut and improved the intonation. You probably wouldn't have to do these things but for the $35 I paid it was well worth it.We put on D'Addario high tension classical guitar strings and would highly recommend this as the sound is MUCH better than the stock strings that the Guitalele comes with.My only \"minus\" would be the neck is just a tad wider than I prefer, but I got used to it quickly and now I don't really notice it.This is one fun little instrument!  I think for traveling it can't be beat as it sounds great, is easy to play, is inexpensive, and fits easily in the overhead bin when flying."],["I love this thing. I tied a strap to it with some shoe strings, I slap it on my back, get on my bike. I take it with me when I go hiking, to school, to the beach, or anywhere really. The tuning on it is ADGCEA which would be equal to as if you had a capo on a regular guitar's 5th fret, which means that you can play the same chord shapes as a regular guitar, the notes will just be higher.As far as quality goes, I'm pretty happy with it. Some people said the strings that they got were no good, but I've had mine for about 3 months now and I have no complaints. The strings are very sensitive though. They bend very easily, so sometimes the chords played sound good and other times they might sound a little off. I see as a very delicate instrument.. when I press down my fingers for chords I press them straight down and make sure I'm not bending them. A;so, because they bend easily, it can go out of tune pretty easily too. I tune mine often, to make sure they are good to go. I have always tuned my normal guitars by ear, however I find that it is harder to do with the guitarlele, so I use a tuner usually.Visually I have no complaints, the wood and finish are nice, the neck has good action and feel, although a small part of me wishes that they had some artwork around the soundhole. As for sound quality, I love it.. the higher strings/notes do stand out more in a way, and definitely have the ukulele sound, but if you play gently enough it creates a nice balance. The resonance is beautiful. It has a very warm, mellow sound. It's pretty loud for it's size too. And it is so versatile, you can play Spanish style chords like Em and Am which sounds awesome (Onda Vaga uses a uke, perfect example, youtube them), .. you can emulate a mandolin to an extent.. I'm not saying it sounds exactly like a mandolin since it obviously can't replicate the resonant-sound of the double layered strings, but it does have the high notes from the strings that at least sound somewhat similar to a mandolin, if you want to cover a song with one. Or you can just play regular songs, normal chord shapes, even powerchords sound good.It's just like guitar. Just tuned to much higher notes. If you know music theory, you can do a lot with this little guitar. I even have used a capo on mine and it sounds good, although when I put it too high up the fret spaces are so small it's hard to make the chord shapes ;-)Before I saw the guitarlele I was looking at rogue instruments because they sell cheap mandolins and ukuleles. I checked out reviews of their instruments on youtube and they had some mixed reviews.. they didn't seem like very good quality. I saw someone mention the guitarlele on the comments, and when I looked it up I knew it was the 'travel' instrument I wanted. 100 bucks, for a completely unique Yamaha brand instrument? You can't go wrong. Yamaha aren't the super-high end guitars, but my bigger acoustic is a yamaha and I don't have any complaints about that one either (a friend gave it to me to replace my epiphone acoustic which I need to get a new saddle for).I hope this review was helpful. If you get one, enjoy it. I know I enjoy mine. I've even started buying other travel instruments like a melodica and a Buffalo Drum.. so yeah. Enjoy!!"],["I purchased this instrument brand new, on an impulse whim due to a managers-choice sale at a local music shop that I simply could not ignore.  It was brand new, unopened, in box.  They allowed me to examine it prior to purchase. In that environment I thought it a nice instrument.However, it can be difficult to properly examine an instrument in a busy store, and that store was VERY busy and noisy.  It's when you get it home and can examine it leisurely in peace and quiet that the details stand out.This is indeed a 6-string ukulele.  It measures a bit over 28\" top to bottom and has the sound of a baritone uke.  I have heard throatier and more mellow instruments in the same price range.  The advantage to this of course is it's 6 string, so if you're a guitar player you can achieve the ukulele sound and portability without learning totally new fingering.... that is of course, until you realize that while it has 6 strings, it is not tuned like a guitar.  It's tuned to ADGCEA rather than EADGBE.  One cannot simply play guitar music on this instrument; all such music has to be transposed or new chord name recognition learned.  Being a total newbie to ukes, this was news to me until I got it home and read the instructions.  So my primary purpose in purchasing this-- to have a small portable guitar, hit a snag.Now that's not totally the end of the thing, because you can be a little inventive and use alternate string sizes to tune this to standard guitar tuning.  It takes a bit of experimentation but it is possible to set this up to standard guitar tuning if one doesn't mind buying a couple of string sets and playing mixup.  So all is not lost there.  It was just an unexpected surprise-- mainly because I didn't research the instrument prior to purchase (it's rare that I impulse buy).So tuning aside we get to the quality of instrument.  That's where the Yamaha really falls short.  This is an oil rather than a lacquer or shellac finish and in several places the oil was still visible and could be wiped away by hand.  There were a couple of glitches in the finish straight out of the box.  That this was a \"rush job\" out of a factory with no finish work at all was blatantly obvious.There are no strap pegs; those will require being added by hand (not difficult, but extra expense and time).The action is of course too high.  That's not unusual-- in truth it's quite common in off-the-shelf stringed instruments and came as no surprise.  But along with the other failures in workmanship it stood out here.However, the thing that bothers me the most:  if I wasn't aware this is a Yamaha Guitalele... I'd think it's was a cheap knock-off child's guitar.  There's not one thing about this instrument that says \"quality\"-- which is quite disappointing.  This instrument sells for about $100.  That low cost is obvious.  This is a \"cheap guitar\" in every way.  I can't honestly say it's a toy, but it reeks \"beginner instrument\".  The tuners are as cheap as they come,  the finish is cheap, there is no decoration, no protective edging. The finish is-- unfinished.I bought this solely based on the number of positive reviews here on Amazon-- and I respect those reviews.  People have different tastes and for some folks this has a \"home made\" feel that they will love.  However I've been playing guitar for (mumblety mumble) deca...uh... years and I know the difference between quaint and cheap.  I own two Ovation guitars, a Peavey electric bass, a hand-made violin and an Epiphone electric uke (which is of such higher quality it's not even a contest. And no I'm not hawking Epiphone.  Facts is facts, that's all.  You can read my very-positive review on the Epiphone on Amazon).When I got this  home and took a good look at it, I found no sign of quality or craftsmanship, nothing that said anything more than \"this was made as cheaply and quickly as humanly possible\".  In truth the only positive thing I have to say about it is that it does have a spruce top and the strings are of reasonably decent quality.Other than those two factors, one can find $40-$50 full-size guitars all over Amazon that equal or surpass this instrument in quality.  The only benefit this would offer is its smaller size and ukulele voice-- if someone particularly wants an inexpensive portable guitar tuned like a uke.  Other than its portability, I find no special merit in this and even at its relatively low price... consider it over-priced (or rather, under-made).One must grant it's largely a matter of personal taste and expectation.  But low quality is low quality.(Edit two weeks later:  I just today saw the Cordoba at a local store-- a direct competition to this instrument.  The Cordoba is MUCH nicer.  It's built better, has better sound, and is finished out much more nicely.  Sorry Yamaha, but facts is facts.  Had I seen the Cordoba and Yamaha side by side, I'd have bought and kept the Cordoba.)That's my honest review.  I know some will disagree.  But others know exactly what I mean.  This isn't an expensive instrument so one really can't expect super-fine quality at this price. However-- I paid about the same price for my electric uke and it is superb quality from top to bottom.  As mentioned, the Cordoba is a better instrument and costs the same.Fortunately the local merchant has a satisfaction guarantee and I was able to return it.  I simply cannot recommend this instrument unless there are no better options-- and frankly, there are."],["This is a great little instrument to keep in the trunk of your car. You never know when the opportunity may come up to do some playing. The quality is unbelievable for the price. I paid around $100 for mine off Amazon and got free shipping to boot. You can't buy a very high quality ukulele for that price. And you get the bass strings on this for more guitar like playing. Don't expect it to have a mellow guitar type sound.  It is more like a tenor uke with a couple bass strings. At this price you could afford to have one to carry with you and one around the house when you get the urge to make a little music.William Roberts"],["This little Guitarlele is great - I have tuned to the standard E tuning of a guitar and it manages very well.

I have had way more fun with this little guy in the last couple of weeks than I had with my twelve string in the last six months.Added info:Now that the tuning has settled down, it is keeping tune very well, with no need to retune during playing.The strings it came with are not the best though, they are wearing through all ready."],["awesome instrument. It's so small that I can take it anywhere. In the car, on the plane. but don't be fooled by its size. The sound is pretty loud and the quality very decent.I don't have any issue keeping it in tune. It stays in tune as much as my other nylon string guitar (full size), which means, it doesn't stay very long in tune like a steel one, so each time you play it, you need to adjust a little bit. But that's expected of any serious guitar player.The only caveat is that the frets are kind of small. If you have large hands, you may have some trouble holding some chords. My hands are not particular large, but I find it a tight fit with chords such as the most common A chord (6th:x, 5th:o, 4th:2, 3rd:2, 2nd:2, 1st:o). Conversely, some of the stretchy chords are very easy on it.

I have used cheap keyboards in the past (&#62;10 years ago), and decided to go for this one despite previous bad experiences.I have no regrets! This thing is great! No tuning required like a real piano, it sounds amazing, and that is before I plug it into my mid-high quality sound system. The weight of the keys feels very nice, and it responds appropriately based on how fast you push the keys (faster=louder), like you would expect from a real piano.There are a LOT of features, many of which I will probably not use. However, I was excited that Yamaha samples from a high quality piano, and you can really hear the difference when you're playing. There are several piano modes that are all quite different, so you can choose your favorite piano type and play on that. Also, for the sound, the form factor for this keyboard is very reasonable. It fits in our small townhouse just fine, and takes up less space than an upright."],["To be frank this is my third YAMAHA  Digital piano-organ I begin with the DGG550 and the the second is DGX650B and this one is a gift to my grand son, having 3 unit from the same company mean the perfection I love ot"],["There are several other good reviews here that discuss a lot of the features of this new flagship model in Yamaha's Digital Piano lineup.  I have been playing various models of these machines for 8 years.  Previously my at-home model was a YPG-535.  Also, at church I play a DGX 640 - the version immediately previous to this one.(The main difference between the DGX-6xx series and YPG-5xx series being increased polyphony, memory and the Graded Hammer System (GHS) which mimics the &#34;feel&#34; of an acoustic instrument).I have replaced my home YPG-535 with this DGX-650 to take advantage of the following NEW FEATURES.(By the way, these are all improvements over the previous model, the DGX-640 too)1.  &#34;Style Recommender&#34; - a NEW FEATURE in this lineup, allows you to set a tempo, start playing a song and based on the rhythm  you are playing, it will list a few likely &#34;styles&#34; that fit what you are playing.  This is a nice time saving feature as you don't always want to scroll through 150+ styles, this can narrow down your options for you faster.2. &#34;Audio Recording&#34; - another NEW FEATURE in this lineup.  Previously, I would make a recording onboard then use a laptop PC with line-in to create an MP3 version.  Now I can save the onboard recording as a WAV audio file to a flash drive, pop the flash drive into my computer, import the file into iTunes and it's there.  (iTunes can convert WAV files to MP3 with just a click).  This is a lot easier.  No cables, no more additional software steps.  Keyboard to flash drive to PC.  Done.  Love it.3. &#34;Speaker override&#34; - The onboard speakers are only 6 watts but they are large and sound very nice.  With all previous models though, the speakers cut out if you plugged in headphones (or in my case, at church, plugged the keyboard into our sound system).  Then I have to turn around and set up a separate monitor to hear myself when the musicians are all playing.  Now, you can set the speakers to stay on (and I can use them as a monitor while the keyboard is plugged into the sound system).  Hmmmm....I may have see about upgrading our church model to the DGX-650 for this feature alone!!4.  &#34;Auxiliary Input&#34; - you can now plug your MP3 player into the keyboard and play along with it through the speakers.  Frankly this is not something I expect to do much of, but it's nice to have it, right?For me, upgrading from the YPG-535, I also gained a few other improvements  such as more voices, more styles, more memory registration banks, additional memory for the onboard 6-track recorder, and up to 128-note polyphony.  All these were present in the previous model - the DGX-640 which I play at church, but I didn't have them at home on my YPG-535. Now I do!Over the past 10 years or so Yamaha has really done a nice job with these digital pianos.  This is really the top of the line in this space.  There are three models in this family.  First, the basic YPG-235 ($250), then the YPG-535 ($500), now the DGX-650 ($800).  From here you spend more money and you either have to move more towards a &#34;real&#34; piano (less voices, styles, etc.) - or towards a workstation/ arranger keyboard.  Both cost more than these.  These are an excellent value and great compromise.As a longtime fan of these digital pianos but I have to admit there are some limitations on these too.  For example, Yamahas have lots of great features and things but they are often only accessible through a layered menu system.  This can make it difficult if you want to make a lot of changes very quickly.  For instance...you only get 4 registration-buttons to set up your favorite settings.  Now Yamaha does have 8 banks for those 4 buttons so theoretically you have 32 presets to work with.  But you only have direct one-touch access to 4 at time.  Otherwise you have to hit BANK, then whatever number - say 5, then the registration button.  It's hard to do that in the middle of a song!).  Keyboards with lots of buttons can be intimidating to look at - but they are great to have.  Often there's nothing like direct-access to a setting or feature you need quickly!But honestly, you will probably play this for a lot of years before you really bump up against these type of limitations.  This might even be too much keyboard for some first-time or second-time buyers who might consider a YPG-535 and be able to save about $300.  For those folks, the biggest difference to consider may be the lack of GHS.  The YPG-535 sounds great and I have loved it - but it will not give you the tactile feedback the DGX-6xx models will.  If the player wants a more authentic feel and the $300 won't break your bank go ahead and get this DGX-650 flagship model.  You won't regret it.  Also consider adding the LP7 3-pedal unit for another $75 or so.  It looks great, feels great, and most importantly, it'll keep your pedal from sliding around all over the place!"],["I've had this piano for about 6 weeks now.  I decided to wait to write the review, until I had some experience using it.  So here goes.As the title of my review states:  I am a professional musician. I studied piano for 10+ years, had a 30-year career as a professional opera singer, and have played piano ALL my life.  I have used my piano skills to accompany myself, learning roles, etc. and also as a private voice teacher. This is all by way of saying: I know pianos, and, I am most accustomed to a traditional acoustic piano.  I recently moved back to CA from NYC, and was not in a position to buy a &#34;regular&#34; piano. After a great deal of research and reading NUMEROUS reviews, I settled upon purchase of this Yamaha Digital Piano.  As someone who dearly misses the upright grand I played all my life, let me just say:  I am THRILLED with this purchase.Sound:  Several reviews on Amazon are noting things such as:  a lack of clarity in the lower range of the keys / imperfect action of the keys / imperfect sound here and there.  If you are looking for a PERFECT Grand Piano sound - then you need to buy a Grand Piano, or spend many thousands of dollars on a Clavinova.  If you are looking for a really FINE digital keyboard that can get as close as possible to that lovely and true acoustic sound produced by a grand piano - then this is the one.  The sound is fabulous - as true and clear a Grand Piano sound as you are going to get in a digital keyboard.  In my teaching I keep it pretty much always on the Grand Piano setting.  One thing I'm REALLY liking about it is, in fact, the volume control.  I have several students whose voices are not quite as developed or &#34;loud&#34;, and the ability to calibrate the volume of the accompaniment is helping greatly in my instruction.Action of the keys:  Personally, I really LIKE the action of the keys.  They feel properly-weighted and not terribly different from what I'm used to in an acoustic piano.  Others on this site have made note of the actual sound (mild clicking), made my depression and release of the keys.  I really don't notice this at all.  It is VERY mild, and does not bother me.Pedals:  Be aware:  if comes with just one pedal that attaches via cord to the back of the piano.  This functions as the damper (sustain) pedal.  For my immediate purposes it's working fine, but I will definitely purchase the add-on, three-pedal unit.  The single pedal, over time, will not be sufficient for my needs.Set-up:  I am a fairly strong, athletic woman, and I was able to get this up two flights of stairs, on my own.  I set it up on my own as well, and set up was clear and straightforward.  Just follow the instructions EXACTLY as indicated, and it will be very easy. It took me about a half-hour. HAVE AN ELECTRIC SCREWDRIVER ON HAND---it will make the set-up monumentally easier.As others have said here as well:  having the ability to utilize headphones, and play / practice, in a way that does not bother others, is invaluable.  Lastly---the only thing I did NOT anticipate is the fact that the detachable music stand sits farther back on the console, than on a regular acoustic piano.  Of course this makes sense - because there are so many digital settings.  So just be aware of that one detail.  I'm used to the music being right at the front.  But this really is not a big deal.If you're looking for a really GOOD, good quality and reliable keyboard that can give you the best possible sound, without breaking the bank, then I HIGHLY recommend this keyboard.  Good luck and Happy Music Making!"],["I bought the DGX 650 to replace a Casio PX 120. I wanted the teaching capability and various play along features and it does not disappoint. The Casio keyboard, although sloppy, does not feel sloppy when playing and is more expressive than the Yamaha. The Yamaha keys seem sturdier but feel plastic like and are noisy. The DGX 650 is expressive enough and the voices should satisfy anyone. I like the speaker system but there should be more power. I have the LP 7 pedals and they are stiff compared to the Casio but could be used without the stand. I had a year of lessons many years ago and was a nervous player. Thankfully I was tought chords and have enjoyed playing. I now want to read full music and the Yamaha DGX 650 is helping me accomplish that."],["This digital piano is great for a beginner and the experienced player.  The range of sounds and styles is amazing.

Buy it as a family piano, and use it for everything else that you might want in a a great piano-action keyboard!"],["I couldn't be more pleased with the piano. The directions were great and the piano went together effortlessly. I love how easy it is to play and the sound is top quality.  I just wish I had bought one sooner."],["I have a room full of professional gear and digital recording equipment in my house and generally ignore these types of products.  However, I was in a local music store last week and just happened to play around on one of these as I was waiting for the tech to finish up with a sax repair for my daughter.  I have to admit that I was shocked by the sound out of this thing.  What was supposed to be 60 seconds of tinkering with it turned into about 30 minutes of testing.  Of course the piano samples were great but other sounds like the Yamaha CP80 (a fake acoustic piano from years ago with a very unique sound), Rhodes (jazzy electric piano from the 70's but still used - a lot) and flute sample (with velocity sensitivity that changes the patch when pressing harder) were dead on.  I can't remember all of the patches that stood out but there were a lot of them.  For 800 bucks I nearly bought it on the spot until I realized that I would rather have it as a midi module for my rack or certainly not with the keyboard stand.  But wow, the keyboard action was really good and the sound was great.  I wouldn't take this on a gig, but perhaps to a rehearsal due to the sound, speakers, and light weight as long as I can dump the stand.  I already own a Yamaha P-70 that I use to drag around for practice etc, but I actually liked this a lot better. We used to have to spend about two grand to get this kind of action and sound years ago.  For the money, it's quite amazing."],["It's everything I was looking for: weighted keys, 3 pedals, and extensive effects with digital interface. It also looks and sounds great."],["Best purchase I made all year long. I bought it when it was just on the market and have had no regrets. Pianists compliment it on its accurate reproduction of the feel of a piano. Of course the sound, while excellent, doesn't give you the vibrations and goosebumps of a real piano while playing, but that's every digital piano.I assembled this all by myself, so it is doable. It has a lot of features, a lot of which I do not use. I can speak to its recording abilities as excellent though. I use it all the time to record my performances and post them on Soundcloud.Really happy with my purchase. I have used this thing 95/100 days I've had it since. Do yourself a favor and skip investing in little-league keyboards. Just get this one."],["I've played an old upright for years. Also have a Casio PX120 that breaks every time I move it somewhere. So I purchased this Yamaha DGX 650.  It has held up well to moving - though it is somewhat heavy (50lbs) and you have to unscrew it from the stand. I also bought a monitor (speaker) with a built in subwoofer (Rokit 6 RPG2)  to bring out the bass notes of the lower end. The sound is heavenly. You have to purchase a male-male TRS cable  that plugs into the headphone port of the DGX 650 to connect the external speaker. You can turn the Yamaha speakers on simultaneously with the monitor to blast the room with a rich piano sound. It is really close to the real thing. Most people you play for will not know the difference. Those that argue that the acoustic piano is better, need to add  a monitor with a subwoofer - and play this bad boy. Also, play around with the different grand piano voices. Tchaikovsky's  concerto #1 sounds fantastic on this piano."],["I bought this to replace an older digital piano whick did not have all 88 keys. I am very pleased with the piano so far (have had it for 2 months). The keys are great and not only do the look like keys from a real grand piano they also feel that way. The grand piano sound is best when the volume is up or if I'm wearing headphones as it can appear somewhat muffeled when the volume is low.There is a flat sustain pedal in the box, but is it very light weight and tends to move around when I'm playing. I therefore also bought a FC4 pedal that is heavier and thus more stable.I use the feature of adding my computer to the the aux in input so I can play on top of music from the pc or the net. Also this way I can create backing in GarageBand and then play the piano on top. There are many features and I have only explored a few, but everything seem to work smoothly and it has increased my joy of playing."],["I am overwhelmed with my new Yamaha! Its capabilities are endless! I am in the process of trying to find someone familiar with my model with whom I can take lessons.

I also ordered the white leather adjustable bench and it's even more beautiful than the picture shows it to be. I have a blue and white living room and it looks elegant together."],["I am happy with my digital piano and enjoying the features. Playing it is fun. What I am disappointed with is that there is no keyboard cover and I didn't notice that when buying it.

It's great for brainstorming ideas on the stock piano sounds, and then use Midi to compose on my software. Key action is very nice, and speakers a decent as well. I did have a weird rattling sound when the volume was 100%, but i'm pretty sure thats normal."],["I wanted to buy a good digital piano for my daughter so she can practice at home. Also, when time permits, I could play for fun. As the experts say all the time, touch and tone are most important for any digital piano and my budget was to find a good compromise under a thousand dollars. There are many brands and models in this price range but Yamaha has the most brand reliability. Other brands I had considered were Kawai, Roland and Kurzweil. They're all good with their own pluses and minuses so it boiled down to the basics - touch and tone.The DGX 650 is a new model and replaces the older 640. This model has the PureCF sound engine and sounds very good (lots of samples for each key from a real Yamaha grand piano). As for touch, it's a weighted keyboard (not fully or heavily weighted) which Yamaha calls GHS (Graded Hammer Standard) - it's definitely weighted when you compare with entry level Casio keyboards but not quite Yamaha's GH. However, for the price range and the purpose (to use for practice from beginner to intermediate) it's plenty. As for sensitivity levels, I could not decipher from specifications but I think it's got atleast 3 levels. So, it is good enough.Now, there are plenty of styles and songs. So many in fact, that it might take a very long time to explore them all. You can do dual (split), layer, etc. A single button is dedicated to go right back to the Grand Piano voice so it is very helpful for my daughter who only wants to focus on the Piano unlike me who likes to play with different sounds and styles. So, this is first and foremost a digital piano and then all the extra bells and whistles! There are many more features which I'm sure I will forget (smart chord, learn to play, etc, etc) and I can't vouch for them since I haven't yet gotten to play with those.Recording via USB is supported to MIDI or WAV format. WAV is good but I wish it was MP3!! As for connectivity options, you have both USB to host and USB to device. For techies, I have been told you can connect iPad using the USB connector to this piano and discover a world of options and use it for learning, playing music, etc., but again, I'm yet to try it out myself and don't know how well it works. There is a single headphone connector which my daughter uses to practice without disturbing anyone else. However, a cool feature is that you could activate the speakers also when connected to the headphones. Recording to Garage Band or other software using this feature is very, very useful since you can record your music along with the built in songs/styles (which we already paid for when we bought the DGX 650) and you can get MP3 (how's that for a workaround to get MP3?) !!When my daughter is ready for more Piano, I will buy a professionally tuned, used upright or baby grand Piano in good condition. The DGX 650 can always be there complementing the real Piano with all those songs/styles/features and when we want to play at midnight silently wearing headphones which we could never do on a real piano :)Last but not the least, don't be misled to believe that more expensive digital pianos are good furniture. Most of them are just compressed wood and if you're really looking for a good Piano which is also good furniture, nothing beats the real thing. I bought mine from my local Guitar Center and they always have hidden coupons which bring down their price by 15 or 20 percent (please ask them) which worked out cheaper than many online prices for me.Full disclosure: I don't work for Amazon, Guitar Center, Yamaha or any other retailer, manufacturer or music company. I'm also not a Piano, keyboard or music expert so please take that into account as you read my review."],["I've been playing classical (and some jazz) piano for decades, with training that included the New England Conservatory.On a very good 6'1 Yamaha C3 conservatory grand piano.  Gave that up (too &#34;big&#34; for my loft -- both physically and sonically),and so I just replaced it with this Yamaha DGX650B digital piano.The most negative reviewer here claimed the piano had a cheesy sound, especially the bass -- even when he hooked it up toan external sound system.  Well, that reviewer either had a bad unit (unlikely), or a crumby sound system (or perhaps, didn't know what s/he was doing) -- or hearing.  I agree that the bass (and extreme top end) are NOT ideal through the piano's own speakers.  So I hooked it up to my 200-watt TEAC stereo receiver, with THAT hooked up to our awesome Polk tower stereo speakers and our 10&#34; Polk powered sub-woofer.  KA-BLAM.  It's not that the piano sounds &#34;louder&#34; this way -- it is just completely transformed into sounding like any one of the several 9' REAL concert grands &#34;sampled&#34; in this amazing unit.Many other stops are incredible as well -- notably the Pipe Organ (which definitely uses the sub-woofer in the above setup!!!!)The other thing that's phenomenal about this keyboard is its interconnection between the particular sampled instrument (or instruments) you're playing, and the way the keyboard &#34;feels&#34; and lets you express nuance.  Its &#34;action&#34; is also very fast -- can't trip it up with the fastest trills.So I give this unit an A+++, and at $800, DUH, a no-brainer.  And DO buy the 3-pedal unit -- if you're an actual, serious pianist.Yamaha Rocks."],["The lowest 20 keys, 8 black and 12 white, are terrible.  Chords in this range sound like a moo cow.  It appears to be the result of the speakers being too small. However, the same effect occurs when the keyboard is played with headphones.  Also, the three pedals are too stiff and cannot be adjusted.I suggest that you go to a show room and try the keyboard out for yourself.  If you have even an average ear, I doubt if you will buy it.$700 really isn't much for a keyboard, but Yamaha should provide a better product than this for the price."],["I was looking for a digital piano since I do not have the space needed for a real one. So I settled for a digital one. However, This Yamaha digital piano is stunning! The sound is vibrant and powerful. While some (or most) digital pianos lack the power and the amplification to deliver several notes at the same time, this one has plenty of punch. We tried playing four hands and even six hands - it was like playing a real piano.I liked the response of the keys. They are light and yet they manage the feel of real piano keys. This is my first digital piano and I was afraid I would not know how to operate it - since digital pianos can do so much (record, playback, switch piano types, etc.). However, I was impressed on how intuitive and simple it all is.Happy customer here!RECOMMENDED!!"],["Like many of the others reviewing this product, this was an upgrade for us. We wanted something that looked good in our living room, but also had many more features than a basic Digital Piano. This Yamaha is a great &#34;compromise&#34;. This looks better than the previous DGX model that had the silver accents, but there are better looking pianos in the same price range. The difference is this one has many, many more features. I recommend viewing some of the youtube videos that show off some of these features. A couple of features not mentioned; One, you can hook up a sub-woofer to the head phone output for better sound on the lower end of the keyboard (there is an option to have sound come out both headphone jack and speakers). Two is, you can separate the stand from the keyboard to take on the road (it is heavy though). Also the unit runs on 12 volt, so with the right adapter can be plugged into a car or rv easily. We are still discovering all the many versatile features, and highly recommend this piano if you like doing that sort of thing. Heads up on shipping. As a prime member I choose 2nd day (which my order showed), but after the UPS label was created, it took 5 business days before it shipped despite contacting Amazon several times.

The dual voices are amazing, the symphony sounds are astounding.The headphones are so good that I kept taking them off, sure in was hearing the speakers, it sounded that good. I didn't want to disturb my neighbor downstairs and I was sure he had be hearing the speakers, but they were actually off when they cut out as soon as the headphone jack was plugged in correctly.NOTE: Just a minor choice that now I'm glad of is that I opted for the white version, which is a lighter visual in my small apt, so much other furniture is already black, getting rather oppressive in a small place. Looking more closely at the black model, it appears to have dark brown in the stand, is that adhesive paper over wood? It doesn't look to be all the same black color anyway. I would buy the white if I had to choose again.Instead of buying the 3 pedal board which I was told pedals are plastic, I opted for the $15 single sustain pedal: -M-Audio SP-2 Sustain Pedal with Piano Style Action for Keyboardswith free shipping, as it is heavy with a solid metal pedal, like a regular piano would have. It really has that brass pedal feel and it weighted with non slip rubbery material on the base. Great pedal for the price.

I got a great deal on this piano from Musicians Friends.  (While a lot of manufacturers like Yamaha require that they be excluded from the frequent MF 15% promotions if you call MF directly they will give you the discount.)Very easy to assemble, sounds good, doesn't take up too much space, easy to move, and the action of the keys is reasonably comparable to a real piano.  The action is not quite as heavy as on my music teachers real piano, but close enough so as not to cause me too many issues going back and forth.I was really just looking for a reasonable playing 88 key digital piano so I have not experimented with any of the digital effects/capabilities yet.Added 12/12/13.The more experience I gain on the piano the more I am starting to notice the difference in feel between the digital piano and a real piano.

I still think it is a great little piano at a great price."],["My husband helped me to put the piano together, the set up was fairly easy, just need some screwdrivers, I think it took us less than an hour.

As an adult I have neither the budget or the room for such an instrument.  I play for pleasure and wanted something that &#34;felt familiar&#34; without the grand price tag.  Yamaha has done a great job of creating a convincing weighted keyboard with a convincing grand piano sound.  After trying several pianos I found the coating Yamaha puts on their keys to have the most genuine feel for this price range of digital piano.  To elaborate, the Casio digitals have keys that feel undeniably synthetic/plastic.  The DGX650 keys feel like a traditional key.  I also have young children.  I wanted to get something that could stand up to the abuse of toddlers.  My kids love music, and I didn't want an instrument that they couldn't touch.  The build quality of this piano is excellent and can take the abuse no problem.  The fact that Yamaha makes the DGX650 in white was another big selling point (although you may think I'm crazy for having anything white with a toddler).  We put this in the family room with some white bookshelves and it looks about as classy as you can make a plastic piano look.  For the same reason people don't like big black plastic TV's in rooms I didn't want to adorn our family room with a big black plastic piano.  The speakers are powerful enough for home use.  We have vaulted ceilings and the speakers fill the room adequately.  Ideally they would be more powerful, but you can hook the DGX650 up to external speakers so I see the issue as trivial.  I mostly play at night after the kids are asleep, so I have purchased a set of good monitoring headphones.  The headphones more than makes up for any performance I can't get out of the build in speakers.  This leads me to the only thing I would improve... having a headphone jack in the front.  I went with DGX650 over the Yamaha P105 because it would have cost way more than $200.00 to add external components to the P105 to achieve the same feature set as is built into the DGX650.  You get a lot of toys and voices for the extra $200.00."],["I just picked up one of these for my daughter who is an avid piano-player. Up until now, we have only let her use a cheap \"beginner\" keyboard, but felt it was time to make an upgrade. My wife wanted a very simple traditional piano (either acoustic or very simple electronic piano with classic styling). My daughter and I wanted more in terms of sounds and features. While that top end of the spectrum has some great work-stations, these are really expensive and tend to not look as nice in a living-room setting.This Yamaha is a great \"compromise\". It looks really nice, feels solid, and the keys are really great, with hammer-action, and simulated difference in pressing lower keys vs higher keys. It is possible to buy an add-on to get the more traditional 3-pedal setup, but for now, the one pedal they included will suffice.Sound Quality is really excellent. The built-in speakers are good quality, and the piano-sound (the main sound in this instrument , accessible with its own key), while personally I am not a musician,it is certainly a night-and-day difference to her previous keyboard, and to my ears, it sounds very realistic. This is supposedly in part to using a good chunk of memory to store multiple samples PER NOTE of one of their flagship acoustic grand pianos.There are loads of other voices, most of which also sound really good.We haven't really gotten too far in exploring features yet, but some I know of;-it can automatically pick a style (rhytm etc) based on what you are playing, if you like a \"back up band\".-there is a one-finger chord feature where it will embellish the key you press for chords.-you can record your songs, multi-track to midi, or usb stick. This means, you can for instance play a song using the piano voice, then go back and add on strings, rhytm etc all in different tracks, so they can be edited separately later. Update: Need to verify if the midi information can be transferred to pc via usb-stick or if it is only stored within the digital piano.-it takes audio in which it can also save along with your piano-creation. Note that for mic, you probably need a mixer or mic-amp, which was my only slight disappointment with this unit. I do happen to have one laying around, so I am ok though.-you can split the keyboard and have for instance bass-sounds on the keys on the left and piano on the right.-you can layer two instruments, for instance strings and piano, to get a fuller sound.-It can be used as USB midi controller, so provided you have a pc, the proper software and plugins, there are no limits to what you can do.Overall, it also seems easy to use. We have not really read the manual yet, but watched a couple (of the only) videos on youtube that were really helpful.What you do not get with this piano (and remember it IS a digital piano..), is stuff like arpeggiators, sampling, vocoders and stuff. Then you should look at the keyboards/synths/workstations. On the other hand, if all you want to do is play piano, and have no interest in other sounds, recording and effects, for the money you should consider buying a second hand piano and get it professionally tuned. I am sure there are people that will say there is no contest in feel and sound.However, if you are like me and my daughter, and enjoys these extra features, and ability to play different sounds, this is an incredible digital-piano for the price!"],["We purchased this piano for our child for Christrmas and we are still being reminded 30 days later how nice it is.  My husband who plays a Korg (weighted keys,work station) was also impressed with its abilities for the price."],["That is amazing.My daughter very like it.For biginner's good.It 's enough for use."],["I remembered recently how much I had wanted to learn to play the piano as a child, but the only thing we could afford was a small (not even 88 key) organ that sounded nothing like a piano and I quickly lost interest in playing it. I decided to price digital pianos, and ended up going with a model that has a key press that more closely resembles a real piano, so that if I ever had the chance to play a real piano, I wouldn't be completely thrown off. I have to say, this instrument sounds quite wonderful and I'm thrilled with the purchase. I added the three pedal attachment to it, as well, even though I am not yet at a level where I would use anything other than the sustain. I would not hesitate to recommend this to someone who is looking for a rich sound (only made better by the fact you can plug it into your surround system if you get the proper cable), plenty of great tech options and voices, high quality construction, all at a very reasonable price. If I had any complaints, it would only be that using a standard bench (the Yamaha BB1), I find it's a little difficult to reach the pedals without wedging my legs between the bench and the bottom of the piano. This can easily be remedied with a single 2x4 cut to the proper length and put under the legs on either side, so that's nothing worth deducting a star over. I'm a pretty big guy (but not obese), though, so I would imagine that people who aren't tall and/or wide won't have any issues with the spacing."]],"title":"Yamaha DGX650B Digital Piano","total_reviews":37,"sentiment":0.8159783784,"label":"positive","best_review":["No question about it, it feels like the best Piano.

The Yamaha YRA-28 alto is an inexpensive and very user friendly instrument that plays with excellent tone and intonation.

This is a very nice instrument at a fabulous price."],["Recorders have a long history in music, dating back centuries to the Middle Ages, and there are many recorder ensembles today capable of playing music beautifully.  There are five kinds of recorders ranging in size from the sopranino (which is the kind children play in schools, like I did) to the bass, which can be almost as tall as some of those kids playing the sopranino.  The alto recorder is right in the middle in terms of length (18 inches) and tonal range.This particular instrument from Yamaha is very affordable, and while it is made of resin, the ivory finish is quite attractive.  The sound quality is pleasant and soft, although it can be difficult to play for people who do not have long fingers...no way could the average child stretch long enough to cover all the holes.  The alto recorder is definitely an adult's instrument.While handmade wooden recorders can easily cost over a thousand dollars, there are many resin models of the instrument that come in under $50 that both look and sound nice.  If you are beginning to play the recorder or simply a cost-conscious person, you'll find a lot of value with any of Yamaha's 20 series recorders (sopranino, soprano and alto only).  The Yamaha 300 series of all five sizes is a little more spendy, but generally more attractive than the 20 series and still far less costly than standard wooden recorders.Just shop around a little and be conscious of the length of your fingers.  In this case, size DOES matter."],["For the price, it plays well.

I'm an adult male and I had a difficult time at first covering the holes of the Alto with my fingers. It is quite a stretch to reach all the holes. If you're a woman with small hands or a child, you might find the Alto recorder too difficult to play.Personally, the Soprano recorder is much easier for me to play. The holes are \"just where they need to be\". I like playing the Soprano recorder more, but the sound produced by the Alto is far more enjoyable to the ear. The sound produced by the Soprano recorder is that of a higher pitch than the Alto and is thus more whistle like (This Soprano recorder is not a whistle. It's a quality musical instrument). Because the sound of the Alto recorder is so much deeper and richer, I find myself playing the Alto more than the Soprano despite the added difficulty.I recommend you do what I did. Buy both the Soprand and Alto recorders. At $12.95 for the Alto and about $20.00 for the Soprano, you can't go wrong.

I've been playing a soprano C recorder for several years now. I'm getting pretty good at it but am not a professional in any way, shape or form! I heard that the sound on the alto F recorder is much nicer than the soprano so I decided to buy the Aulos 309A alto recorder. According to all the reviews I read the two best recorders are either the Aulos or the Yamaha. In the end I decided to get the Aulos because most said the high notes were easier to get and that the sound quality was great. It is! The Aulos has a really great professional sound to it. I will NEVER go back to the soprano after hearing the alto.But none of the reviews I read said that the Aulos is actually longer than the Yamaha. And for me...this has made all the difference. Stretching as far as I can, from my index to my pinkie finger is exactly 5 inches wide (on my right hand).I really struggled trying to get a clear low F note on the Aulos (all holes covered). I could reach the holes but just barely. It was a struggle. So I decided to buy the Yamaha YRA-28B III alto recorder. When I measured both I found that the Yamaha is a  of an inch shorter in length than the Aulos. They are pretty much the same around but the Aulos is a little longer. I also measured the distance from the bottom two holes to the 4th hole up (holes that pinkie to index fingers cover on right hand) and found that the Yamaha is exactly a  of an inch shorter in length than the Aulos. The Aulos is 5  inches and the Yamaha is exactly 5 inches. What a difference that shorter length between the holes makes! I have absolutely no problem covering all the holes and the low F note is much easier to get. And because I'm not struggling so hard to reach the holes I'm playing much better on the Yamaha than I did on the Aulos. So for anyone with a small hand like mine I definitely recommend the Yamaha over the Aulos.I also want to say that if your hand is larger you will also be able to play the Yamaha with ease. And I found that I actually like the sound of the higher tones better on the Yamaha than on the Aulos."],["I have had an alto recorder on and off for a while...

I've played a Kung, pearwood tenor for years but find that arthritis has taken a toll on my hands.

I have the standard recorder lesson books which are primarily filled with European folk tunes and are helpful for developing an ear for the instrument. After I do the standard lesson session, I spend some time just improvising, trying to work out the melodies of some of my favorite tunes.While I never expect to play the Recorder for an audience, it does provide me with relaxation and enjoyment to counter the frustration experienced by trying to learn how to play the Bass Guitar.

IT is, however, in tune with itself (that is, a C and an D are a major second apart, even if the notes are not perfectly in tune to A 440). The lower register (lowest F to Bb) tends to squeak if blown too hard- thanks to the straight windway, this is easy to do if you don't know how to tongue properly. Another downside to the straight windway is that the lower register is a little bright. The upper register, however, is improved slightly. This instrument is great for adults with large hands that can't play the soprano instrument, or those looking for a warmer and lower sound than the soprano.

Actually, it is a bit much as I find that I like to play it in the wee hours of the morning and I fear disturbing my neighbors because it makes a really robust sound.It is also important to note that this instrument is about the size of a billy club and unless you have large hands or really long fingers this is going to be a bit more than a handful for you.Note also that before purchasing this I had read that a wooden alto recorder is preferable to the plastic one because the plastic one gets clogged with spit.  I didn't heed that warning and I should have.  While the plastic soprano one also is affected by condensed air, it is a simple thing to blow it clear.  This alto recorder is a whole different story.  It may be that I am drooling into it but I find that I can play for only a couple of minutes before my notes don't play cleanly.  As soon as I clear the condesation the thing plays cleanly again.  This is both exasperating and irritating.  In fact, after playing the thing long enough to know that I want to keep monkeying around with the alto recorder, I am going to buy a wooden one for its absorptive qualities.Thus, I would counsel you to skip the plastic recorder and go straight to the wooden one if you know you are going to play it, even though you'll likely spend twice as much.I've gotten just a few hours of pleasure from this instrument and I'm frustrated enough now that I don't like it very much now.

I'm the twelfth to review it here and the others have done a fine job, so what else can I say? I can agree and also provide another experience. I own a recording facility and this little gem has now been used on 100 recordings of various styles and is in the top percentile of recording amps in my opinion.The favorite seems to be the Matchless setting, nearly clean, with the guitarists pedal board for their own sound. The amp mics up and records well without cranking up extreme decibels and loses the undesirable lows of a big cab. I'm sorry but I can't tell you about USB recording, it's just not used when you have several designed rooms and fifty different mics to choose from but what I'm trying to help you understand is the level of quality and big sound you'll get from this tiny amp.Now as a stage amp it can't compete with drums, right? Wrong! Just kick some back through the monitors and you can quit a big setup and leave the stage with a guitar in one hand and your amp and pseudo stack in the other. It just does not sound like a practice amp, other than its inability to create desirable feedback through the speakers this amp is superior to most large amps. But speaking of volume, while our colleague is technically correct about 10 times the wattage for 2 times the db, that can only be applied when all else is equal, which of course it never is. So this 2 x 5 watt amp should not be thought to compete with much larger speakers in amps with 4 to 6 times the wattage, although volume versus size it's quite impressive. And kids, ask anyone experienced, you cannot turn up your stack in a club, you've just spent too much money to purchase a hernia, buy a cheap weight set for a workout.It needs a case? Okay, so foam line some Tupperware, hah! Really, the shipping box in a carry on with wheels would work well. So my clients and I love it, I've used it with a live drummer and when you think about it, it's very cheap for such quality sound. Hey, I've used and recorded a lot of amps and this one is special. De gustibus non est disputandum, (in matters of taste, there is no argument), only personal preference."],["Very cool little box. Exceeded my expectations. Very good tone at low volume. I have a vintage Blues Junior and tried to bring the volume down with a hotplate but tone suffers. This little guy carries the tone at a whisper. Worth the rather high price, Head and shoulders above other practice amps I've tried."],["The sound is gorgeous!!! I have owned a small watt tube amp, which I had to turn up to loud, and a fender mustang I that I thought was awesome, but wanted the battery option. I had been looking at this amp for a while and not thinking it could really do what they claim. But there were too many good reviews on this amp, and great YouTube vids on it, so I decided to give it a shot. I could always return it right! Well this amp sounds better than my Mustang 1! It has a clarity that is hard to describe. It sounds so awesome at lower volumes. I'm selling my mustang now. This is the only amp I will ever need unless I start playing live."],["I copied this from my other post. Keep a couple of things in mind. Their is no amp hiss or noise when on battery, and I keep all my amps plugged in to a power conditioner. So your home electricity noise might affect how well yours works. I also know this is a long read, but I have been burned by enough amps that I was hesitant on this purchase. Especially after multiple amps I basically lost money on looking for this kind of thing.Ok guys, so I decided to pick up another amp. criteria were simple (kind of). I already have great amps for at home. But this amp had to be low enough volume for my son and my godson to play around on, it had to have decent set of features, it had to portable, and it had to accommodate both acoustic and electric guitars. So a versatile amp with low volume sound that was unsurpassed for cheap. I know that puts big limits but Yamaha is excellent at audio engineering. basically a battery powered go anywhere. So after talking with a couple people here, and setting my price limit fairly low, I went and checked out the Yamaha THR10C. I know they have 5 models, so here is the break down. THR10 - Original Release Basic Catch All 10 watt, THR5 - 5 watt version, TRH10X - Heavy Metal Version, THR10C - Classic Blues Version, THR5A - Acoustic Guitar Version. Ive owned the marshall battery powered, the roland micro cube, the orange battery powered amps. all bedroom style portable amps. Well I must say I am really impressed with this amp. I picked mine up from guitar center for 160$ out the door (normally retail is 300$). A little negotiating and that I have good repoire with them helped a lot.What you get: 10 watt amp with 8 presets and 5 empty slots, usb cable, audio in cable (from cell phone or computer or such). I have a good 8 or so effects already on, and combinations their of. Two things that were a plus... One is the line in has its own volume control. So the guitar volume, and line in volume are separated. Pretty nice if you feel the song is over powering just a tad and need to tweek that. The other thing is the acoustic modeling is very impressive. Very solid. In fact I tried it out on a semi hollow, lp, acoustic, and 12 string. When I was in the acoustic room the amp was sitting under me and really not visible. Oh the store was kind enough to put batteries in it, so I didn't have to worry about finding plugs (great thing too, I could jump from place to place and it functioned flawless). A number of people came up with the comment \"that fishman really sounds impressive\". Well sitting in front of me was a fishman artist series, but I was plugged in to the Yamaha, so I pointed it out, and showed them how I was switching from condenser mic setting to acoustic setting. And at 1/3 the size, and 1/6th the \"wattage\" it surprised a lot of people just how full the sound was. A lot of people were giving great comments, and one guy even wanted to buy it, but I already had my hands on it. It has incredible tone when using it with the 12 string as well.Sound output wise. Its 10 watts. But if you don't know how that works heres a quick lesson. Sounds is not linear like you would think on the controls. Sound is logarithmic. So if you want to double the sound of a 10 watt you need 100 watts for twice the sound. 1000 watts to double the sound of a 100 watt amp. So the difference between a 10 watt and the 60 watt fishman? well its about a .6 increase in volume. so don't get caught up in watts over quality. And don't let this guy fool you. Its loud, I had a guy playing on a fender mustang II and I was able to play loud enough to compete over him. Which if you know how watts work a 10 watt amp vs a 40 watt amp is only a .4 increase, but when you add quality it nulls that down. At low volume you don't have the problems you have with other amps. I didn't hear any muddiness, any loss of any real quality, no rubber band effect, and the levels stayed about even. You didn't lose low end and get stuck with only middle tones like a lot of amps I have played do. When I turned the volume down on acoustic or electric the entire range lowered not just one end.Software is pretty cool. You can control everything and even do advanced effects mixing from a very simple interface. The software will even remove the guitar from the song you are playing, which when the speaker is usb in to the computer it acts like the computers speakers. So anything you play, youtube, mp3, anything gets output through the amp. which has its own output volume. so your not stuck with just the master. I can have my guitar cranked way up, and the output volume at say 2/10. which is really really awesome. and the interface is smart. If you adjust something on the interface the knob doesn't move, but the second you adjust it physically on the amp, the interface goes with the input from the amp. and you have tons of leverage on sound. While this is the C model which stands for classic blues, it comes with the 8 models built in, and 24 models on the software. Including 3 for a bass guitar, and 3 for acoustic. strumming acoustic, flatpicking acoustic, and fingerpicking acoustic. In the software you have a total of 100 models but 75 are empty. You can import, create your own do whatever you want, but on the amp stored you only have 5 custom slots, kind of sucks wish it had more. and the sound output from the usb or aux in is stereo, very crisp clean loud stereo. works great for playing a (mp3,youtube,even dvd) song, and eliminating the guitar out of it, and running your own guitar in (which it will record for you, so its a full on recording interface). Which I might add is nice, you have an acoustic condenser mic, an acoustic pickup, and electric pickup recording interface all in one. for less than 200 dollars with software. Just like any other amp the gain and master work like a preamp and master. gain for preamp and master for well master. Its built after a 6L6 amp. Oh and you have cabinet selection too I might add. They are British Blues 2x12, Boutique 2x12, Cali 1x12, American 1x12, Boutique 1x12, and Yamaha 2x12. The built in amps are Deluxe (fender blues deluxe), Class A (Country or Southern Blues), US Blues, British Blues, Mini (Mini amp solid state circuit sound), Bass (like a Bassman Fender), ACO (acoustic electric condenser mic), Flat (acoustic electric guitar style amp, no effects, no mixing, what goes in comes out as pure guitar). The flat also works great on semi hollow and electrics if you want just pure clean tone. Effects Chorus, Flanger, Phaser, Tremolo, Delay, Reverb, Chompressor, Gate, Tape Echo.It does work on my tablet and computer. I have used it with both usb and the aux out from the tablet to play music. It is very light and easy to carry around. It was really fun to run this amp from the tablet on batteries. I was able to outside with my tablet playing the backing track, the usb interface so I could make adjustments, and my guitar. I have a feeling hunting season is going to be a bit more fun this year with these portable capabilities. Its about the size of a 12 pack soda box. Built out of solid medal and powder coated which is nice. For 200$ and after spending hours and hours not much else really compares. You get an amp with settings for both electric and acoustic guitars. You have a computer interface so you can control it via a computer or via the amp. This acts a very accurate computer interface for recording. You can control the volume the guitar and aux in separate. The software will remove the guitar from a song so you can play in its place. When you start up the software it asks what your doing (acoustic, clean electric, distorted electric, piano, or stereo acoustic guitar) all are + vocals, so you can record guitar and vocal together. It will also do music scoring and audio production so you can edit songs you recorded and really master the tone you want. Oh and it has a headphone jack so you can listen to yourself as you play, or not disturb other family members whichever you choose. Oh I must add the software did pickup the mic in both the tablet, and the laptop. So you don't need a mic. The built in mics on both aren't great, but they work.I hope that helps, I must say I am really impressed with what Yamaha has done, and I have never really heard anyone complain about their Yamaha amp. This is the second one I have owned and as far as low volume playing, its very hard to beat for this price range. What its missing, Bluetooth (I mean really in this day and age it should be blue tooth controlled), and as someone else pointed out the ability to record from the aux in port. With todays technology this couldn't have been hard to add. The software used to change the amp settings is already a very simple program.Incase anyone wanted to see, here is its size comparison. That's an asus transformer prime tablet docked in a keyboard, and a Gibson hummingbird pro. Its not much bigger than the tablet. Fits on a work desk, or a night stand beautifully, out of the way, but the sound can fill a large room no problem.[...]"],["this little amp is awesome. The sound & affects you can get from this little 10W is amazing. The additional tuning by the included software is a plus. It also runs on batteries but my NiMH rechargables only ran for about 4 hours."],["This lightweight amp puts out a lot of sound for its size. You can tweak the sound using the controls on the unit. But the Yamaha THR Editor software that can be used with it allows you even more control over effects. Once you dial in something you like, you can save it to a preset slot. I've also used it on battery power, and it sounds just as good. Considering its flexibility and portability, I think it's well worth the price."],["After A LOT of looking at amps of all types and sizes I realized what I really needed was a small amp that would accept headphones, input from an iPod and had some decent  amp modeling.  The THR10C has all that and  a few features more that I've come to enjoy.  The amp modeling is certainly adequate for my tastes and makes play-along with my iPod stuff more fun.Bottom line:  Yes, a 100 watt Marshall turned up to 10 WILL have more emotional power etc.  (it also costs a lot more and is way heavier!).  This is a practice amp.  Get it?  Just for practice.  Quiet (except in the headphones)  Three am in your apartment - no problem.  Think of the possibilities.I'm saving for the JVM stack now."],["I'm a consultant and spend almost every week (Sunday - Thursday) out at client sites and living in hotels.  I picked up a quite playable ChEaPiiphone Les Paul for dragging through airports, but didn't have a solution for an amp that could both be packed into luggage AND produce tolerable tone... until this.  I got this amp about a month ago and it packs nicely inside a medium sized suitcase and there's still plenty of room for clothes.  I did get the bag for it for additional protection since the airlines tend to abuse luggage and it's survived 3 trips so far.  ...but being portable is only part of what makes it a great choice for travelers.  For it's size, you would expect a transistor radio sound..Yamaha uses the space very creatively as it has a pretty nice bass component in the range of tones.  The overdriven sound it produces is like a recording of a full size amp being whaled upon, played at a lower volume (well I keep it low as a favor to hotel neighbors).  I have turned it up at home and it sounds equally good at the high end of it's volume range.  The different boutique overdrives it produces are also key.  I like the Class A setting with high gain for a ZZ Top Boogie blues sound.  ...but can jump quickly to a Vernon Reid-ish Cult of Personality sound by dialing in Mini on the amp selector.  The effects (as the modeled amps) do not sound cheap or gimmicky.  I have a Fender Mustang II and all but a meager few of the amps are even half-way usable and all the effects sound cheap.  I love everything about the Yamaha THR10C.  I may even try one of the others since they did such a fine job with this one.  ...as for the switch.  It does look a little light-weight.  I would simply replace it with a heavier duty one if it should ever break.  It's just a switch and wiring that in can't be that much work.  I definitely would not pay to have it done.  HIGHLY recommend this amp for people like me, that travel a lot, and don't want to sacrifice tone for size."],["I like the fact it has a ton of great tones, plus is ready to go anywhere anytime I want. Sometimes I like to go out on my deck and play. Changing environments really helps the creative process and this little amp make that easy."],["A very fine product for what it is designed to do. This not an amp for volume( don't even go there) It is excelant for practice and accompliment with acccoustic guitar, say, for song writing or small venue perrformance. It uses room dynamics and gets a true like mix that is easy on the ears. With its interface capabilities the true power is unleashed !This product was shipped by regular mail and took almost three weeks to arrive.  Would recomend for advanced players with an understanding of sonic dynamics and understands the difference between recording and stage performance."],["I have had a number of small amps over the years, this one is a great amp. The THR10C has a terrific set of amp models, but I tend to use the Deluxe model the most. The effects controls are usable and the reverb is good although some have complained about the echo delay, it works for me, but it isn't terrific. The response is similar to a tube amp and a good piece of sonic engineering. This is not a metal style amp nor is it going anywhere but the house or similar small setting. The sound is spacious and great with the potential for editing and storing five of your favorite settings. The bottom end on this small box is better than I would have thought. The only drawback is the expense, but I am happy with this little amp. Certainly a Roland Microcube is a good small practice amp and a lot less, yet it really cannot be compared to this collection of classic amps. It does have this weird or funky looking tube glow which makes no difference to me. I highly recommend this if you have the money and desire to access these amp models in a small package."],["I am not sure if I have ever been happier with any piece of music gear.After reading all the wonderful reviews I was worried that I would be  oversold and disappointed.I thought the reviews were almost too good to believe.I bought amp this on another site, but I had to pass on my comments.This amp is also an excellent replacement for my computer speakers.Hard to believe, but after taking the speakers off of the desk and adding this &#34;swiss army knife&#34; amp,I now have more room on my desk, plus all these amps right in front of me.It is possible that my other big amps I  will go in the closet. This is so handy to plug into,The guitar sounds are great.  I have strat, tele, LP, acoustic electric and nylon string guitars (K&K; pickups).You can make them all sound awesome. More guitar variation than I will ever need.The Thr10C was the correct model for me. I was worried about the acoustic sounds, but there is more than enough variety in the 10C  for my needs.I like the 10C so much I may buy a 5A just for the acoustic, but I am trying to cut back.....stop laughing.What has not been mentioned is the high quality feel of the amp. The knobs, the powder coated chassis, and even the glow light feel very high quality.It is the  quality appearance of what I expect of Yamaha.Originally I thought the &#34;glowing light&#34; was kind of a gimmick, but when it is turned on it matches the glowcolor of the knob positions and I am glad it has the light.The chrome allen head screws look beefy and match the other chrome items.I was wishing this model came in the cream color, but seeing the black THR10C next to my black computer monitor, my black keyboard and black mouse, it  really looks good. I am glad it came in black.I can now pick up any of my guitars and easily dial in a pleasing tone, regardless of what type of guitar.You can bring up an mp3 to play along with, and adjust the volume of the guitar/song easily.I am using less than half of the available volume. Plenty loud for my office. I turned up the amp to see how the bass would sound and you can get muddy bass if you really push it.At the volume levels I will use the bass if very good.For more volume, I could send the sound &#34;out (headphones)&#34;  but that is not why I bought this.I have big amps if big sound is needed.I also have a micro cube. My MC it is a great little amp, but the Yamaha is in another league. The THR is also more money.(Well worth it) especially for my use.I keep calling the THR an amp, but to me it is so much more.It is small. It is quality, It is a modeling amp, it can be dialed in to your taste, it is computer speakers (for me), it is a guitar tuner, and above all,  It is very user friendly.The designers did an outstanding job.The only critique ??  The gold lettering printed on the case (Treble, bass, etc) are a little hard to read under low light, but after you use the amp for a bit you know what that knob does without looking.The gold color does look rich, but a little hard to read. If I saw a different  &#34;easy to read&#34; color, I may not like it. The gold looks rich???I have not installed the Cubase yet, but the THR editor installed fine and is easy to use. You just need to follow the directions.The Thr5 shows as the original model in the software, but once you plug in the USB to the amp the correct THR10C shows up on the screen.I guess you can tell, I like my purchase.I do not do many reviews (I am sure you can tell).In my opinion, his product is outstanding, and the price makes it  a real value."],["The THR10C is a pleasing little box with some honestly lovely sounds and interesting capabilities like the program-ability of the presets, the wonderful sounding models, and the general ease of use. The type of power switch they decided to use, and the location where they positioned it, is simply not the level of quality the rest of the design reflects. I also think it would be lot more versatile if the built in power amp had more headroom. The 35 watt ZT junior is only 25 more solid state watts than this one, but it is usually sufficient to use with other players while the THR10C is not quite able to be heard in anything other than acoustic settings. I realize this was not one of the design goals, but it would turn a nice to have device into something a whole lot more people would use.I'm more irritated with Yamaha than actually hating this amp. The first thing I noticed when I opened the box was the flimsy tiny power switch sticking out all by itself on the left of the top of the amp. I even jokingly mentioned to my daughter 'i bet that will be the first thing to break on this amp'. Within a month the unintended prophesy came to pass, the switch had broken during a trip where the little amp was placed carefully into the back of the car. I don't even know how or when, but at some point during the trip, some other object must have bumped into the switch. The tip completely broke off. The power switch was at that point completely not functional.My initial contact with Yamaha sounded promising, it appeared they would have the amp repaired according to the guarantee. But as I got passed around to expert after expert the last one in line told me the fault was mine and that the design could not be bad. Therefore they would not repair the amp. They would recommend a Yamaha authorized repair center for me to take the amp to.After contesting this outcome for a while he did agree to sending me a replacement switch for free. At least they were kind enough to do that. But I did call around to see if I could have it professionally repaired. It was going to run $75 just to look at it, with a time based fee on top of that. Reasonable, yes, but the amp cost me less than $200. Why would I pay half that just to have it working again, and likely break the switch again.If you do end up getting one of these, I recommend you build a case for it if you intend to take it anywhere, and really be careful to not break the fragile switch.To sum up, my message to Yamaha:1. Fix the power switch with something less likely to be snapped off by not much force.2. Increase the headroom a bit3. Stand by your designI have had wonderful experiences with many companies such as Empress Effects (who also uses tiny switches) and ZT Amps who actually stand behind their design decisions.

All the other solid state modeling amps sound awful.  They take what ever is coming out of your guitar and add what they thing the amp \"should\" sound like. The result, a very generic, uninspiring tone regardless of what guitar you're using.  An expensive guitar, a cheap guitar, it sounds pretty much the same and certainly not like a tube amp.Along comes the Yamaha THR10C in 2013, one of three new Yamaha models designed for a more specific audience than their \"original THR10\" which is a more general purpose model. I don't play metal so I have no need for several of its \"high-gain\" settings. However, the THR10C emulates the sounds of the lower gain, boutique style amps.  The guitar amps that it simulates are: the Fender DeLuxe, a Matchless DC 30(Sampson era), Fender Blues Jr., a Marshal Blues Breaker combo(Clapton from the \"Beano\" album), and finally a Dr. Z, Mini-Z.  The biggest difference between the THR10C anything other companies have made is, this actually sounds and acts like the tube amps it's emulating.  Yamaha's digital sound processing involves emulating the actual \"components\" of a vacuum tube amp like the way resistors, capacitors, potentiometers, vacuum tubes, etc. and how they interact to the way you play.  This is the closest any company has come to capturing the sound of a tube amp via a solid state technology.Runs off either a wall wart or eight batteries, the software that accompanies the THR10C is very good and give a few extra effects and the ability to fine tune the sound when connected to a computer.  Because it's only about the size of a loaf of bread, it's portable but with a very big sound when placed on a desk in front of you via its two full range speakers.  This is not an amp you would perform with but I've seen videos where you can use two mikes into a p.a. and get more than adequate sound for a larger room, lots of possibilities if you're creative.I have tube amps similar to the ones the THR10C emulates but to get the nice, warm, over-driven tones, I need to really turn up the volume of my tube amps which can be a problem with my neighbors. I can get those same over-driven, sounds at a sane volume with the THR10C. Again with the same tonal characteristics as a tube amp, i.e touch sensitivity, harmonics, clean tones when the volume is rolled off, etc.  You can connect an ipod and play along with music , backing tracks, and there's even a Yamaha free app for on itunes that allows you to edit music and play along at different speeds of minus the guitar track.There are a ton of YouTube demonstration videos on this little amp and they're all quite informative but the bottom line is, the THR10C is everything it claims to be and nothing in its price range is even close, add in the various software that's included and this is an outstanding buy if you're just starting out or a seasoned professional, it won't disappoint!"]],"title":"Yamaha THR AMPS THR10C Electric Guitar Mini Amplifier","total_reviews":19,"sentiment":0.8726473684,"label":"positive","best_review":["I like the fact it has a ton of great tones, plus is ready to go anywhere anytime I want.

In the same way as all we, people, have the same hands, legs and heads but have different nature and voices, the guitars, even of the same model of the same manufacturer may differ wildly.The Classical guitar has to be made of wood. And wood, even of the same age and tree has much of personality and much of \"specifics in sound.If you consider this guitar you are shopping in the lowest end for cheap instrument. Well do not do it! Because I doubt you will learn it ever.First of all buy the real Spanish guitar. I mean Spanish made in Span not the \"Spanish\" made in China or anywhere else. Spanish guitars, even the cheapest made toward sound, not toward look. Do not buy guitar with laminated top, it will sound as a toilet sitting and you never will be able to get decent sound out of it. The quality of sound is very important while playing classical guitar and you produce the sound with your hands. It is crucially important to learn to produce right sound by positioning fingers and nails properly: you will never learn it with cheap, not authentic guitar, because it will sound the same whatever you will try! It is like a car that make only left turn. Then you will try to play the real guitar not the bogus one , you will find youself incapable to make it sound as other players do.Do not try to choose guitar yourself because you can't produce any reasonable judgment until you will learn how to make it sound properly, you must take someone who actually knows how to play classical guitar. You have to get  a decent instrument because you MUST fall in love with the sound of one, otherwise it is pointless: you play guitar because it fascinates you esthetically. I doubt that toilet sitting sound out of shipping box that pretends to produce music will fascinate you!Once again, Spanish guitar improves with an age but not one with the laminated top. If you in budget, do not trash you money with cheap Chinese garbage but save more instead and by the real thing.Here we are, these are my recommendations for those who really seek to learn to play classical/Spanish guitar:1. Do not buy guitar online, buy it in the local Guitar Center for example! Listen to the actual instrument. If you like the sound take it!2. Do not buy guitar with laminated top, they are guitar only by appearance.3. Buy Spanish guitar from Spanish manufacturer, they start as low as $250, roughly."],["I bought this for my husband who has been dying to learn how to play guitar. He really loved it! This guitar shows quality but is great for a beginner."],["I've tried the C40 a number of times, and I've always found it a bit lacking.  While the price is very reasonable, I can't really bring myself to recommend the guitar.  The sound (both basses and trebles) overall is muted, and it feels a little bit too light and cheap.  No fit-and-finish issues, but it sometimes feels a bit like a cardboard box with strings.Granted, for USD99 (Amazon's price at the time of writing), it's not a bad instrument, and if price is your only concern, then it's hard to criticise issues like weak sound and light/cheap construction.  Even if you're a beginner, though, you will notice the difference if you're willing to spend a bit more on your guitar.  In addition, while the C40 might be worth the 99 dollars it's being sold for here, you can do a lot better around the C40's list price of USD170.I bought an Almansa 402 for about USD220 a few years back as a secondary \"beater\" guitar - while it's not spectacular, it has much more presence, and is much more fun to play, than the C40s I have tried.  In my experience, the higher-end Yamaha guitars can be great (I love my GC-7), but they tend to skimp a bit at the lower end.In the end, though, it's up to you - obviously other reviewers are happy with their C40s, and I don't want to be too much of a wet blanket!"],["I have owned this guitar for about 6 years now and in my opinion it is the best value for a beginner level classical guitar.

I named her Baby; I strum this little darling more than all the other guitars I own combined... it just sounds so good and feels right and seems to be in my hands all the time.Before this guitar I will admit electric was king at my house... but not any longer, this little sweetheart gets hugs and kisses from me every day.I love it!"],["I bought a Yamaha C-40 on EBay for $60 (and had to add strings, so I guess that was another few bucks).

Not professionally, just for fun. If you want a guitar to start on, or just to play around on, this is a great one. If you want something that's indicative of your many years of expertise, seek your soulmate elsewhere, but you probably already knew that if you've been around guitars for awhile. Like I said, I just like to play and not really worried about &#34;professional tone and resonance&#34; This one is just fun to have around the office."],["I give it a 5 mainly because in this price range, I really don't know of a better sounding or higher quality guitar.  I have owned several guitars, steel, nylon, 12-string and electric.  While I overall prefer the mellow sound of the nylon string and the melodious sound of the 12, I like them all.This guitar is not the best sounding guitar, but if you are looking at this price range you should not be expecting it to sound like a professional handmade guitar.  It is great for a beginner or for someone who is on a budget and I recommend this one to anyone who asks me.  The tone is clear and balanced throughout the fretboard.  Many guitars in this price range sound more like a toy than a guitar.  This one goes miles beyond that in comparison.  I used to buy cheap guitars regular particularly for beginners and I have bought some decent ones made in Mexico in this price range (or slightly cheaper) but even they don't quite come close to the reliable tone and solid feel of this guitar.  It has enough tone to play even after you have bought a more expensive and better sounding guitar.  I would use it maybe for a different sound or to take somewhere you wouldn't dare tote your 5 or 10k+ (or even 1 or 2k) guitar to!It's been said that you can go from playing the classical type of guitar to playing steel string and electric, but it's tougher to start on playing steel and electric and then playing this type of guitar.  I started on this type and I can say that I can play steel and electric fine, but I can't speak much for the other way around.  However, I did notice that some of the mediocre reviews were from primarily steel string guitarists who complained not so much on the sound but primarily of the playability of this guitar so maybe this statement is true.  A guitar pick doesn't play as well on this guitar as it would on a typical steel or electric guitar.  The strings are spaced farther apart with a slightly higher action than steel/electric for fingerstyle playing.I've known many beginners who start on steel string quit because of the pain from pressing down on the harder, tighter strings.  Some cheap steel string guitars have a high action as well which translates to more pain when you are building your finger strength (and numbness) to play clear notes on the guitar.  The nylon strings are much softer and bend easier while under tension making the pain more tolerable for the beginner.  This translates to longer play times as well while practicing which may in turn allow faster learning of the basics.However, with all that said, if your joy is the steel string sound and if you really just don't like the sound of the nylon string, then by all means go for the steel string instead.  I believe that for a steel string with comparable tone and quality, you may have to pay slightly more.But otherwise this is the best bang for your buck in my book!"],["I bought this guitar for a friend of mine for her 16th birthday. I went around to several guitar shops around town playing various brands and such of classical guitars. The Yamaha C-40's sound stood out to me and I was amazed when I checked the price tag!I have an Ibanez GA-3 and I personally like the C-40 better... bummer for me...My method in trying out guitars is to play it before you look at the brand name tag or the price tag. This gives me an unbiased approach to the guitar. Y'know, if I pick up a guitar and look at the tag that says \"C.F. Martin\", I'm obviously going to like how it sounds and all. Works the same with the price tag...Anyway, to sum it all up: quality guitar for beginner up to intermediate level players... don't be fooled into thinking it's a cheap-O guitar b/c of the price tag."],["I was amazed to get such a beautiful and acoustically sound guitar for such a low price.

I wanted something decent but inexpensive incase I don't like the classical style too much so based on reviews I decided to buy the C40 Gigmaker pack.  I also played a few other classical guitars in this price range at my local guitar center for comparison.First thing I noticed was that the build quality was quite superior for a product in this price range.  The finish was excellent and the fretboard was absolutely even with no flaws.  However, when I first played the thing I was very disappointed because it sounded aweful!  Luckily I knew what the problem was... the strings that come with this guitar are absolutely horrendous.  Yamaha totally skimped on the strings which is rather odd!  I knew this due to feedback from others and had also ordered some D'Addario Pro Arte classical strings.  After restringing the guitar with the D'Addarios the difference was night and day.  A word of caution: restringing a classical is a pain, unlike steel strings nylon strings need to be \"stretched in\" so they may lose tuning until they are fully stretched.I've been playing some simple classical pieces that I knew how to play on my steel string (Romance, Aria etc.) and it sounds pretty damn good.  I'm really impressed at the quality of tone from a guitar in this price range.  Some people complained about the cheapness of the tuners.  I don't see any issues with them, they work just fine.The bottom line is that if you're looking for an entry level classical guitar you cannot do any better than the C40.Good job Yamaha!"],["I review this guitar based on its features versus price. If course, it is unfair to compare a 140$ guitar with a 1000+$ guitar.I got this one, very old, from a friend who gave it to me.

That's why my friend gave it to me.I went thru the set up myself to lower action at the nut and action at fret#12. Now it plays really smooth, easy on my fingers. This is not something a casual guitar player or newbee knows.Most string instruments, when newly bought, need to go thru a setup to be playable. Sometimes you are lucky that the action is low enough and this can be skipped.The sound is good for this price range. It does not sound as good a a few 5000$ I had chance to play and that's all expected.I even go further to install a preamp/under-saddel transducer to turn it into electric.Plugging into an amp, it sounds amazing.

I live in Guadalajara, where you can find great handmade guitars, but the prices are high for a decent guitar and the Yamaha price/quality combo is very hard to beat.The finish is not the nicest and could be better, but again for the price...

I use Augustine classical guitar strings, I also use Pro Arte (Normal Tension EJ45C) classical guitar strings which sound really good (highly recommended).

I bought it for my wife to learn to play, and we both really like it. I've found myself picking it up quite often and having a good time playing around. If you want nicer, you will have to pay more."],["When you approach the purchase of a musical instrument you can face a real minefield of decisions.  You can pay a lot of money for a real quality instrument, but if you can't play it - then the money is wasted.  You must buy the instrument that suits the kind of music you want to play.This is especially true with Guitars.  Broadly you can have classical, spanish, folk, acoustic, steel and electric guitars (but there are lots of in-between categories)This is a classical guitar.  So what does that mean, and what should you be looking for?First off, it has the strings set widely apart, since a classical guitar is designed to be plucked, not strummed.  Wide spacing between the strings allows you to get your fingers into the strings to pluck them.Secondly : The fretboard is flat, and this means you need to reach further with your fingers to cover all the strings.  If you have a small hand, or are buying a guitar for a child, this could present difficulties.  Folk (acoustic) guitars have slightly curved fretboards.Thirdly, this is a guitar designed to take soft strings of nylon or gut.  Metal strings could damage a classical guitar, cutting into the wood and overstraining the neck.  The soft strings give the guitar a full, but soft and gentle tone.  It is not designed for playing heavy metal.  It is a guitar for a small room, not for a stadium.Probably the most important elements you want in your guitar are that it be easy to tune and has a good action.  Yamaha have a great reputation for quality and consistency, which is why you can think of buying one of their guitars without playing it.  You can pretty much guarantee that the tuning keys will operate properly and will not wiggle around, spoiling your tuning.The action is the one thing you cannot gauge without holding the guitar in your hands.  This is a combination of the tension of the strings and the height of the strings over the fretboard.  If the strings are tense (steel strings or 12 string guitar) they can pull the head of the guitar upwards, bringing the strings farther from the fretboard.  This means your fingers have to be very strong to depress the strings and make clear notes.  A tightly strung steel string guitar needs a very low action or it is unplayable.  But an action that is too low will leave strings vibrating against the frets, disrupting the sound of the guitar.  This is less of a problem with classical guitars, because they have soft strings and lower tension.  Even if they are set high you will rarely have difficulty bringing them down to the frets.For the price it is hard to beat this guitar as a starter instrument for someone learning from scratch.  You will be able to learn the rudiments of classical, spanish and folk music, and this will give a student a route into electric guitar should they want to go the rock route later on.Anyone who can master the wide frets on this guitar will easily be able to transfer to a folk or electric guitar later.  But if you start with a folk guitar, where the strings are set close together, you will find it difficult to move out to a classical guitar.If in doubt, go to your local music shop and spend a day messing with the stock to get a feel for what is important to you."],["I own several Yamaha musical instruments. I purchased the C40 assuming that the overall quality would be good and that the acoustical sound would be at best acceptible. The one that I received was defective in that it buzzed/vibrated when certain notes were played (sympathetic body vibrations). Also, it could not be played in tune-i.e. the fret/nut/bridge alignment was off. So. I suppose this is typical for a $100 entry level guitar. Perhaps I got a bad one. I know that guitars, even the same brand and model, differ greatly from one to another."],["The C40 is my first guitar and I could not be happier.

It's not LOUD. (I don't want loud at this point!) There were no rough wood edges or extra glue globs and the wood stain is evenly applied.The C40 has so much bang for the buck, I reccommend it to anyone who wants their first nylon string guitar.

The makers make a lot of musical instruments in addition to classical guitar, violin, bass , electric or folk guitar, torumpet, accordion..... That is to say, Ymaha make all the musical instruments.

But the cost performance is great. Ymaha is the company that can make great things like C40 in low price in addtion to the high quality instruments like concert pianos. Even if it is low price guitar, makers do not compromise to make that. That is the result that the company is the most famouse in Japan and have many confidences from Japanese.In Yamaha classical guitar lineup, C series(about100$-600$) is the lowest price series, but if you want higher performance guitars, there are GC concerts guitar series(about600$-10000$).You may think that 10000$guitars is very high! But the truth is that, Ymaha have high quality skill that can make such guitars, can transfer the skill to low price guitars.

It play's great and sounds great too."],["If you can get a \"new\" or \"unused\" one of these, and have a hundred to spare, there's probably no better \"classical\" guitar in this range.  I am no expert.  I really don't know anymore what about a hundred or so will buy in a decent acoustic nylon string guitar, with good sound above all.  I'd be willing to bet however that unless you find a gem at some used/new guitar store at around the same price that sounds this good, pass it by, and buy this one.I have been playing various guitars for over 40 years (my, how time creeps up on one, ha).  I was never much fancy to the nylon string classical variety much, more into steel strings, a much louder, dynamic variety.  And better, imho, for \"beginners\" than this particular model.  I moved on to electrics, Gibson, Fender, Carvin (?!), and my prized Guild.  But the only thing I ever learned about how to play a guitar (period), was on a steel string acoustic or electric.  In other words, if you're a total novice to actual guitar playing and not just some nerdy geeky PS2 Guitar Hero wannabee, NEVER try to learn guitar on this.While the sound is totally awesome on this guitar, compared to even one of those overhyped Esteban tinny cheapos, nylon or string, while the sound from this is so beautiful and balanced, and worthy of the Yamaha name, while totally-patient guitar learning folks couldn't learn on a higher level, for the rest of us non-geniuses out there, this instrument is frustrating at best.Not frustrating in sound.  It sounds great.  Frustrating in above all else, the action and the neckband width.  \"Action\" refers to how far down you need to press a string down to get a decent sound.  Fancy and expensive electrics have almost \"touch\" action.  That means that you hardly need to press down on a string (on the neck/fretboard) to get a decent sound.  But acoustic guitars are nothing like electrics.  The rare case of an acoustic having a similar action as an electric is rare, and costs many hundreds.  Likewise, a great nylon/classical guitar type such as this, with great action, I'm not sure exists.  If you find such a rarity, I'd bet it runs in the thousands.So, the action here is not great.  It is a pain to press your fingers so deep with every note on this guitar.  To position them so perfectly as to play every note and/or chord without distortion.  As a beginner guitar (of any type) then, I'd have to recommend caution as to this purchase, as it can cause early bloody fingers and lack of patience to continue in most people.My other main gripe with this guitar is the (again, frustrating) lack of neckboard/fret \"DOTS\" or inlays, which mark the third fret, fifth, seventh, and so forth, up to the \"harmonic,\" but maybe this is just a feature of \"classical\" guitars.  Again though, for beginners, this can be unnecessarily confusing, and for old timers, equally so.  This is a solid instrument however.Overall, I have to admit that I started playing guitar long, long ago, on just such an instrument as this.  One handed down to me by my uncle, a World War II vet, through several hands, and several changes of strings, etc.  It's a tough guitar for a beginner.  If you can semi-master this though, when and if you move on to regular steel-string acoustics and then electric, you will undoubtedly be a better player in the end than most.I was pretty good in my day, but having received this as a gift recently, after not really touching a guitar for some 15 years, while I could truly admire the beautiful sound of this, I once again felt a frustration.  The action and fret space/string space of this is not suitable for a beginner, nor an old but faded whiz.If you are an accomplished player, with recent and steady practice and performance, this is a real bargain.  You're not going to get this quality of sound from anything less expensive.If you're a beginner or an out of practice aging hipster however, I'd say save up for a $200-300 electric and proceed onward to guitar playing greatness, without the pain, the frustration, or the bloody fingers..."],["This is not a guitar that you buy to play led zeplin, Korn or any other american rock music.  This is the perfect guitar to get that authentic spanish sound.  This is not a guitar to learn on unless you want to learn classical spanish ballads, however I do think it is a good investment for a beginner that only has an electric guitar.The reason the strings are far appart is for finger plucking and nylon strings need to sit higher than steal strings.  When I played this guitar for the first time at my local guitar store, I loved it (and still do!).  You can't play rock, but songs like \"dust in the wind\" (all finger plucking) are great for this guitar.  Just like a strat is for rock, a telecaster is for country, a les paul is for lead, hollowbodies are for blues and so on, this guitar is for classical spanish music.  If you want a good beginner guitar, get a Ovation knock off or a Dean (Deans are the best for beginners).I have some very expensive guitars, but I love playing classical music for girls on this one, and they love it.  It is my weapon of choice!Simply put:  It's a great guitar for spanish ballads, and soft finger plucking songs, but not much else, because that's not what it was designed for."],["It seems to me everyone got exceptional instrument except me.  I don't understand what's so great about this guitar.  Action is just horrible.  I mean, look at 12 fret its 10 millimeters.

I suppose, one shouldn't expect much from $100 dollars instrument.  But I repeat, it's not great.  Now about bass strings.  They sound bassy, as I suppose, they must.  But the thing is their bassines overpower trebles. Trebles sound unproportionally weak. And yes, yes.  I did changed strings on a good ones (D-Adario normal tension something) upon getting this guitar from Amazon  I should say though that guitar starts to sound much better now than it was when I just got it.  But action on this instrument still kills my fingers.  I do finger pushups in order to develop muscle on my phalanges, in order, to play on this guitar somehow.  Of course, I could ask professional to fix bridge nut, but why would I do it for such cheap guitar.

All i can say is they are great sticks, really light, comfortable and easy to handle but who ever packaged it was either blind or didn't take care of the sticks while they were packaging it OR they didn't protect it enough in the box.

I stuck with the sticks for about two weeks but every time it was the same blister generating effect.

The plastic tips should make them more durable than the regular ones."],["The dip - grip really changes the balance of these sticks in a positive way. A little more weight to the back end.

I did some research and read reviews that 5A's were a good weight to start out with. I also liked the fact that these sticks had a rubber coating on them that looked good and provided some extra grip. I know it is probably from my inexpierience in gripping the sticks that the rubber actually caused a slight blister on my finger.

Like these my vintage one are made from maple and are very light weight. There are some differences, but there are some surprising similarities too.The maple is light, so your attack is going to be softer. That translates into minimal projection,, which make these a perfect substitute for rods that many drummers are using to play quieter. The key advantage these sticks have over rods is the definition you can get from these sticks on a cymbal while still playing relatively quietly. Rods on a cymbal just don't sound right.I am less comfortable with the balance of these sticks than I am with my preferred brand and model. For one thing it seems as though the fulcrum point is farther back towards the butt. I play traditional grip, so that does hamper me a little. For match grip players this may be a plus. Also, these are a tad thicker than most 7A sticks, which normally run in the .500 to .515 inch range. At .525 inches in diameter these are closer to a 5A. I do love the 16\" length though.Although I am not wild about the coating it does not bother me. On the positive side it keeps the stick from sliding on hot, sweaty gigs. I am wild, however, about the ball tips. I love the sound I get from my cymbals and they also seem to rebound better than the acorn tips I normally use.Overall these sticks are a great replacement for rods and are definitely worth checking out if you like different size sticks for different playing situations."],["Really nice feeling sticks and got them from music 123 who gets your items to you asap.

I have played air drums to the very best from Rush, Motley Crue, Led Zeppelin, you name it. None of the chicks I demonstrated my skills to were impressed however...that is until I picked up a set of Zildjian Black Hickory Drumsticks Nylon 5B.Let me tell you, these are amazing for air drums. There's something about black sticks, for one thing. When these logs are flying through the air as you mimic \"YYZ\", for example, it's absolutely hypnotic! They're nice and light too...one of the biggest problems an air drummer can have is heavy sticks. Choking up on drumsticks really makes you look wimpy, and there can't be anything wimpy about air drums.Anyway, so I persuaded this gal Beth to come to my place after a pizza (I splurged on some extra cheese, you KNOW that). I sat her down and implored her to check out my stick-whipping skills, and she watched as I nailed \"Dr. Feelgood\" to a TEE! All thanks to my Zildjian Black Hickories! (Nylon 5B)She told me she'd never seen anything like that, and I think she may go out with me again sometime soon. I could tell she was impressed by how speechless she was. So of course I bought a few more boxes in anticipation of the big second date (this may be why they're out of stock), and I have been practicing the fills in \"Black Dog\" for the next time she comes over.

I decided to go with stick wrap which worked much better with highly increased longevity.If you are a performing drummer these might last one of two gigs before the grips start coming apart - then you will have to strip and wrap them.

I have tried coating from the hardware store (the type you dip tool handles into) but it eventually rubs off.  I have had some success with roughing the sticks with really coarse sandpaper, but that leads to blisters.  With these DIP sticks I can move my grip to a balanced spot on the stick and after a 5-6 minute song - it is still there.  Using a matched grip, I like to balance my left stick on my pointy-finger and 'tiggle' it with my thumb to make a light roll.  I can only do this with the DIP.  With plain sticks my thumb just pushes them away.  I also like to drop quickly to the bottom of the sticks for hard tom rolls.

BTW, the new sticks come with a black coating on the end that you hold in your hand. Just enuf friction to rip a hole in my finger on my left hand.

But like I said the quality of the birch and design alone is worth the online price as the Zildjian model \"HEAVY JAZZ\" with wooden tip certainly does live up to its name and offers more quicker rebounds on the rolls than hickory 7AN's with nylon tip although the heaviness of the birch wood makes me miss the light weight of hickories which is how come I still opt to using the Firth 7AN nylon tip hickories more often than 90% of the time. And like with other folks, I've also tried my own different methods for retaining grip from between roughing it down crosscut-wise with sandpaper to completely wrapping it up just right with plumber's white tape but what still works easiest for me whenever I happen to be in the serious mood for maintaining a decent grip is to simply pour a little soda pop onto my hands as need-be to make my palms and fingers sticky enough even though it feels yucky as heck but it works for me up until I can hardly wait to wash my hands."],["hello, so i bought these drums sticks because i wanted new one to jam.

I never had any control or flying stick trouble with these and they were generally my preferred sticks unless I wanted something heavier then I switched to some Vic Firth 5A's.  I used these sticks so much that after 2 months the rubber coating began to get holes in it.  I continued to use the sticks with the holes in the coating until I developed blisters on my fingers. I then cut and peeled off the rubber coating but the drumsticks are not special or as enjoyable without the coating. Overall I liked the sticks and will buy another set.

They felt flimsy, and the grip wasn't so great - got slippery too fast. I decided that there had to be something better out there. I looked at my options on Amazon, and these sticks were on sale for even less than new \"branded\" Rock Band sticks. Knowing Zildjian is a very respected brand in the drum world (I am a musical person, I just do more with pianos - so I remember seeing the name at Guitar Center!), I did the smart thing and bought these instead of the spiffy looking but questionably valued glow in the dark sticks.After they arrived I tried my new sticks out immediately, and there's a world of difference between them and the old ones. Especially since I suspect that they're made out of different kinds of wood. The old sticks seem to be pine, the new ones are hickory - soft wood vs hard wood. Since I don't know the right terminology, all I can say is that they feel far more solid and are FAR easier and more comfortable to use.
